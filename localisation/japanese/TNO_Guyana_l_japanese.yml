 POLITICS_Cheddi_Jagan_DESC: "PPPの創設者であり長年にわたり指導者であったチェッディ・ジャガンは、政界において慕われも軽蔑もされる人物である。前ガイアナ大統領である彼の在任中、党内外の厳しい抵抗とさまざまな政策をめぐる分裂とに見舞われた。フォーブズ・バーナムに敗れ大統領職を退いたが、その主要因はアメリカからの圧力であった。しかしチェッディは簡単には辞職せず、再びガイアナ全土を掌握した。バーナムの権威主義的な政治行動を受けて、アメリカはチェッディ・ジャガンにバーナムが過激な経済計画を遅延する限り復興政府を率いるよう要請し、ジャガンはそれを受諾した。今度、過去の失敗の原因を知ることで、おそらく彼はガイアナに社会主義を導入することができるだろう。"

 GUY_Minister_John_Carter_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nPeople's National Congress§!\n--------------\n§LA lawyer who practiced and taught law in London during the war, John Carter is a staunch ally of Forbes Burnham who has been associated with him since 1957, when he joined Burnham's People's National Congress and became its first chairman.\n\nAppointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs in part to give Burnham an ally in the cabinet, he has so far served effectively in his official role, though it has left him with little time to assist Burnham politically.§!"
 GUY_Minister_Lionel_Luckhoo_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nThe United Force§!\n--------------\n§LAs well known for his loyalty to Peter d'Aguiar as he is for his ability as a lawyer, Lionel Luckhoo is d'Aguiar's most able ally in the cabinet.\n\nHaving served in parliament in the 1950s, then as Mayor of Georgetown from 1955 to 1960, it was during his mayoral tenure that he became associated with Peter, and after the latter's victory in the 1961 elections, Lionel was among the first to join the United Force party. He now serves as the Minister of Finance in the coalition government.§!"
 GUY_Minister_Plotemy_Reid_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nPeople's National Congress§!\n--------------\n§LOnce a teacher, then a veterinarian, Ptolemy Reid now finds himself among the most powerful men in the land. After graduating from his studies in veterinary medicine at the Tuskegee Institute, he was initially unable to find employment in Guyana, but eventually found a position as the Chief Veterinary Officer at the center of the powerful sugar plantation industry in Guyana, the Bookers Sugar Estate.\n\nBecoming involved in politics in 1960 as a member of Forbes Burnham's PNC, he is known to have a bit of an independent streak, and Peter d'Aguiar is convinced that Reid can be won over with enough patience. For his part, Burnham is convinced of Reid's ultimate loyalty to him. Only time will tell which of the two is right.§!"
 POLITICS_Peter_D_Aguiar_DESC: "Considered by most to be the fiercest defender of conservatism and capitalism in all of Guyana, Peter d'Aguiar is a man loved by many and loathed by the rest. He contested the 1951 elections on behalf of the National Democratic Party, but chose not to run in 1955 or 1957.\n\nWith the split in the PPP between Forbes Burnham and Cheddi Jagan, however, Peter formed the Defenders of Freedom, an anti-communist political organization allied with the Catholic Church seeking to protect and advocate for conservative policies. After negotiating an alliance with Burnham for the 1961 election in an effort to ensure Jagan's removal from power, Burnham and his allies successfully won the election. D'Aguiar transformed his following into the 'The United Force' political party and has governed uneasily alongside Burnham's PNC.\n\nHe now seeks to put his ideals into action in Guyana, but internal troubles within his coalition and tensions with Venezuela may see these hopes ground to dust."
 GUY_Elizabeth_British_Legacy: "イギリスの遺産"
 GUY_Elizabeth_British_Legacy_desc: "Despite the British Empire being dead, the ghost of the Empire remains at large within Guyana. While rule under the USA was short and quickly lead to a independent Guyanan democracy, British influence remains deep. British businessmen own large swaths of the Guyanese economy and the political system remains closely tied to the Westminster system, of a Prime Minister with the Queen Elizabeth as Head of State.\n\nWhile Cheddi Jagan's administration sponsored decolonization programs, with some businesses being expropriated by the state, the creation of a welfare state and even creating a new flag, Peter D'Aguiar is not interested in continuing these programs and supports the retainment of the Westminster system.\n\nResentment runs deep in Guyana against the colonial past, and as long as its traces remain, the resentment will remain as well."
 GUY_Venezuela_border_dispute: "エセキボ問題"
 GUY_Venezuela_border_dispute_desc: "The border dispute with Venezuela, once thought quashed has once again reared its ugly head.\n\nVenezuela claimed more than half of the territory of the British colony of Guyana at the time of the Latin American wars of independence. While Guyana thought the boundary was clarified in the Arbitral Award of 1899, Venezuela has called the award an Anglo conspiracy.\n\nWith the independence of Guyana in 1950, Venezuela declared that it would no longer abide by the arbitration decision and has laid claim to the Guayana Esequiba. Venezuela has a larger army and the power to seize this region by force, however the USA has sided with Guyana so far in this conflict, and a direct confrontation would jeopardize their approachment to the OFN. To ensure Venezuela never makes a grab for the territory, we must remain in the OFN and cultivate relations with America."

 GUY_US_investment: "アメリカの投資"
 GUY_US_investment_desc: "One of the conditions for Guyanese independence was their position in the OFN as an American ally and access to Guyana's economic markets. While investment has taken place since independence, many investors were scared away by Jagan and his socialist policies.\n\nWith the election of Peter D'Aguiar and his economically liberal party, he has attracted many American businesses to invest in Guyana's small economy.\n\nGuyana has now entered a period of a economic boom and as long as the money continues to flow, the economy will continue to grow."
 GUY_Fragile_Coalition: "脆弱な同盟"
 GUY_Fragile_Coalition_desc: "Despite the PPP governing Guyana for the entirety of the 1950s, they were defeated in the elections of 1961 due to a electoral alliance between the two opposition parties of the TUF led by Peter D'Aguir and the People's National Congress led by Forbes Burnham. This alliance born out of necessity to remove the PPP from power, must now collaborate in government.\n\nThe coalition is not stable and in the short time it has been in power there have already been several rifts over key policies. The alliance only remains together to ensure that the PPP does not call a vote of no confidence and win the following elections. However, as time goes on and more rifts emerge, most have agreed that it only remains a matter of time until the coalition inevitably collapses."
