# LEADERS AND MINISTERS

HOL_paul_de_groot_rm: "Paul de Groot"
HOL_paul_de_groot_rm_desc: "One cannot talk about the Communist Party of the Netherlands without mentioning its leader, Paul de Groot. The son of a Jewish Amsterdammer diamond cutter, he followed his father's line of work while staying in Antwerp, briefly joining the local socialists and trade unions before moving back home as Belgium was invaded in 1916. \n\nAs the October Revolution dawned on Europe, he participated in the founding of the many communist movements in Holland, joining agitations, until becoming a member of the Communist Party of the Netherlands. Because of his activist past, great reading, journalistic qualities, and tactical insight, he stood head and shoulders above his fellow administrators. Yet, as the years progressed, a form of collective leadership emerged, as Bukharin distrusted De Groot, who was more in line with the Stalinist opposition that had been purged from the USSR. \n\nHe emerged as a tough, often careful, and distrustful leader. Something that would prove helpful as the Reich moved into the Netherlands, occupying it and then invading the Soviet Union as well. Along with other party members, especially Lou Jansen who launched a manifesto to call for a strike against the occupier, began a resistance movement. History painfully was not kind to them, as the Soviet Union collapsed and Paul's family was taken to Auschwitz and executed. \n\nThis tragedy filled the revolutionary with guilt and regret, as the persecution and executions increased, he left the party. Only continuing to write newspapers from an undisclosed location, De Groot only returned to activity in the 1950s, as the Reich was facing a crisis once again. Slowly rising once again within the ranks, eventually, he lead his party and the resistance through the Bürgerkrieg and reorganized the leadership once a revolution seemed near. When the Volksarmee crossed the border, his forces rose up to support the liberation and it was finally over. \n\nFor that the Dutch people may never suffer and be safe again, Paul will take all efforts to build an everlasting fortress of socialism."
HOL_fred_schoonenberg: "Fred Schoonenberg"
HOL_fred_schoonenberg_for_desc: "§YForeign Minister\n$communist_stalinism_subtype$§!\n§F------------§!\n§LFor many, the question of the legitimacy of the republic troubles them. Not for Fred Schoonenberg, a journalist for the communist party and fighter for the resistance movement in the Zaan region. A defender of the legacy of De Groot even after he left, he was also among the very few who sacrificed it all to resist the occupation. A ferocious anti-imperialist, that challenged the recruitment of Dutchmen into the ranks of the Einheintspakt forces and promoted defection to the resistance. \n\nWhen the red light of a new era shined, Schoonenberg rose to represent his nation on the international stage. To point out the hypocrisy of the 'free world' that perpetuates colonialism, exploitation, and inequality. To him, there will only ever be one Netherlands: The Dutch People's Republic.§!"
HOL_nico_schrevel: "Nico Schrevel"
HOL_nico_schrevel_eco_desc: "§YEconomic Minister\n$communist_spartacism_subtype$§!\n§F------------§!\n§LKnown in inner political circles as 'seconde', Nico Schrevel grew up in a Dutch Reformed family and joined the leftist youth resistance movements. Together with Daan Monjé, within the armed groups, he was one to call to restore the ideas of old leader De Groot and a founding member of the 'Marxist-Leninist Center.' While Monjé only acted politically and militarily, Schrevel conducted deals through the black market to get funds for the party. \n\nAfter Paul's return and their association with Germany's Spartacist resistance, Schrevel continued to work in the MLC when the revolution finally happened across the border and soon spilt over. Due to his short experience in business and sales, he was appointed minister of economic planning.§!"
HOL_daan_monje: "Daan Monjé"
HOL_daan_monje_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government\n$communist_spartacism_subtype$§!\n§F------------§!\n§LA pipefitter by profession in the ports of Rotterdam, Daan Monjé was initially a prominent member of the communist resistance along with his kameraad Nico Schrevel, both young leftists that rose up in arms against the occupation. His activism and sympathy for the 'De Groot line' led to him and his group creating a small sect within the party, which would have been kicked out if not for Paul's sudden return. \n\nBeing kept under the wing of the old leader, the 'Marxist-Leninist Center' was able to continue its research and eventually come into contact with another resistance group, the Revolutionäre Zellen. His good relations with Wolf and his loyalty to Spartacism, coupled with his experience and organizational talent earned his position as vice-chairman.§!"
HOL_marcus_bakker: "Marcus Bakker"
HOL_marcus_bakker_sec_desc: "§YSecurity Minister\n$communist_spartacism_subtype$§!\n§F------------§!\n§LKnown as the most likely successor of De Groot, the 'Dutchman of Steel', Marcus Bakker had humble beginnings. Being born to an accountant in a slaughterhouse in Zaandam, he joined the Communist Party of the Netherlands in his youth and led its youth wing as it began an armed insurrection against the occupiers. After Paul's return, he was a vital piece in reorganizing the central committee around him, writing articles denouncing various members he accused of revisionism and demoting them. \n\nA rigorous director, cunning speaker, and vigilant fighter, he kept the party theoretically united and became De Groot's right-hand man. Now, he will make sure to punish the collaborators and occupiers for their crimes and end an era of injustice.§!"

# NATIONAL SPIRITS
HOL_exiled_dilemma: "Exiled Dilemma"
HOL_exiled_dilemma_desc: "Across the Atlantic, lies the defeated House of Orange-Nassau, relying on loans and assistance from the OFN and standing as a rump state. A true relic of colonialism and oppression against the Surinamese people, this so-called 'government-in-exile' calls itself the true Dutch nation. As we have freed ourselves with Germany's assistance and resisted bravely for decades, we cannot take this seriously, but the U.S and their allies have. We can only hope that our native comrades break their chains and end this debacle, but for now, a dispute of legitimacy has hurt our international standing."
HOL_longest_hours: "Longest Hours"
HOL_longest_hours_desc: "Decades of occupation have passed when the Netherlands was completely under the control of the Nazis. The executions and the destruction may have taken an enormous toll, on the lives taken and in the ruin that was the brutality and chaos of power struggles when the puppet master fell. Now, the clock has finally hit noon and our hardest task shall ensue, as we will begin our Five-Year Plan to not only rebuild what we lost but to progress into the future better than before."
