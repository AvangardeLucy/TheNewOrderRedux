From the weakest statelets to the largest and most prosperous, none would have been exempt from economic aid, and security.\n\nThe events of the vote have been dark days for the Comintern. Many say that if we cannot even decide to vote together, then what is the point of fighting together? The ties that bind us together are growing slacker with each passing day. If we cannot stand together we will be torn apart and butchered by the hungry wolves of Capitalism and Fascism. Regardless of now, there is always next time.

Secondly, all members of the Comintern will recognise all Socialist territorial claims and holdings. Including not only \"internationally unrecognised\" holdings of Comintern nations but territorial claims and borders that we all desire, even if we do not control the area.\n\nMay the Capitalists tremble in fear, for we have put our petty differences aside and focused on the real enemy. Not other workers, who are simply trying to survive, but the fatcats who made us suffer in the first place. Regardless, this has been a colossal undertaking.

With the Act's failure, our enemies salivate with malice and glee, as they know a door has been opened. A gateway into internecine, inter-Socialist warfare. While the chances of a war between member nations are low, the possibility still hangs over our heads, like the Damoclean sword of old. The Capitalists will be all too willing to exploit this chance and have our brothers do their fighting for them.\n\nDespite the failure, the vote was a stressful time for us all. Due to this, the General Assembly will not be able to vote on another resolution like this until one month later. Maybe then, the members of the Comintern will find true peace with each other."

Calling for the establishment of a pan-socialist board of science will ensure that the Comintern can catch up with the more \"traditional\" powerhouses of engineering and science. The Scientific Bureau is an international board that provides both the resources and the attention that emerging technologies from socialist nations need to flourish. One can only imagine how the capitalists can only look in panicked terror, as they realise that they will not be able to live in the future alone.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the Comintern will genuinely become the arbiters of the future. More importantly, the direction of these technologies will not suppress the workers of the world - but ease their worldly issues. Some of our more ambitious members even talk of a Socialist Space Program! While Red Boots on the Red Planet may be a long way away, it is no longer in the realm of fantasy.

Today, that glorious vision has been swept aside by the cold, dark reality of politicking.\n\nThe proposal would have had the Comintern at the cutting edge of technology, with unseen and undreamt wonders constructed at our very whims. A gathering of the brightest and most brilliant across the planet would have guided humanity's emancipation. Not just from the iron chains of Capitalism but from the shackles of life itself for the good of the species. It seems that the General Assembly did not agree with this thesis, however. The fantastical boundaries of science - where the warm embrace of it and magic reigned - remain outside our hold. Even if by inches.\n\nWe will not be able to vote until a month passes.

Not against one particular group - although that has certainly happened - against the downtrodden of society, every single collection of human beings. The proletariat. Where we once raised our eyes to the baking Mesopotamian horizon, hopeful for a future yet to come, we now stand tall and mighty amongst our peers. As today has proven, we are only getting stronger.\n\nThe vote to admit a fellow socialist power to the Comintern has passed. Today is a glorious day for the workers of the world. Our movement is not an iron fist, gleefully beating against our oppressors until we attain freedom; it is a tide. A tide is slow, almost unmoving. Yet bit, by bit, it rises. Slowly, it washes away all that stands against its goal until it has stood - proud and triumphant. We are the tide, drowning the capitalists. Against all the money and weapons they will throw against us; they will only slow down the inevitable. Let them savor the last few seconds of dominance.

The vote to let a nation join the Comintern, in its entirety, has failed to make headway. A massive blow to our goals, the backroom politicking and factionalism proved too much for the resolution.\n\nThe diplomats of the applicant nation walk home, hanging their heads in shame. Many among us see this as a lost opportunity for a more powerful Comintern. Even the smallest member would be an achievement for our alliance as a tool to legitimise ourselves. However, it seems that it was simply not to be. Other budding revolutionaries are reeling at this news. After all, what would be the point of a revolution if we were left isolated by our comrades overseas? Perhaps, this may have been a blessing in disguise.

However today, one such nation gets an opportunity to see how our organisation works. The vote has passed on bestowing one applicant the special title of an \"observer\" nation. While they are not part of the Comintern fully and therefore cannot participate, they are still under our protection and guidance for now. If they so wish, they can join the Comintern fully, provided the vote goes their way.\n\nAll that is left is for the applicant to accept our offer. If they take up a position inside the Comintern, then they are more than happy to join us. For some reason, if they do not then they will forge their path elsewhere. Whatever the case, we have at least proven our unity in the face of total uncertainty. The ball is now in their court.\n\nWe cannot vote on a resolution until one month passes.

Appropriately named the 'Observers', they can decide either to leave or integrate fully into the Comintern. How this would work is that an applicant shows interest in becoming an 'Observer'; approaching the General Assembly. The Assembly would hold a vote. If passed, an offer is sent out to the applicant. If the applicant accepts, then they become an Observer.\n\nHowever, today that vote has failed. The applicant nation has walked away in bitter defeat. Dissenting voices to the majority decry this as 'factionalism 'and condemn elitism, from an organisation that was formed to combat elitism. Others say that the Comintern must be a monolithic alliance, and to do that we must cut off ties from the rest of the world to compete with the Capitalist powers.

If today has proven anything, we are playing it well. The Grand Assembly has voted on its resolution. The resolution is relatively simple. Solidifying COMECON - a collective development fund - into a full-on economic bloc. Not only does this mean that trade between our nations will be easier, but we will prove ourselves an unbreachable bastion against the frothing tides of capitalist economic pressure.\n\nNow that we have voted yes on the resolution, our work has begun. Already, thousands of bureaucrats and aspiring NEPmen of far-flung nations are discussing how best to integrate our economies so that the sum is superior to its parts. This news will not be taken by the reactionary fatcats lightly. They will try to break our unity and drive us into bankruptcy. They will try to deprive our people of their hard-gotten gains and sacrifices to further their interests. They will try to stamp out the will of the worker like they have done for so many millennia!

No longer would the toil of our workers be delivered into the hands of the Capitalists; but have been sent to our fellow revolutionaries abroad. If the act had passed, the Comintern could have proven itself as a sincerely legitimate force amongst the global superpowers of the world. Yet, democracy is a fiddly, uncaring thing.\n\nThe exact reasoning for each member's refusal of the policy is too complicated and varied to list in its entirety. It does not matter, regardless. The Comintern grows further divided, and while we may still frequently trade with each other, our financial advisors cannot help wonder. Wonder about an opportunity missed for a brighter future. A future where our grandchildren work, not to survive, but to thrive. A society where the dark, Victorian smog that strangled our ancestors is nothing but a half-remembered fairytale.

It thirsts for our blood, and they will be relentless. We cannot afford to make a mistake when it comes to vanquishing our enemy. Today, we have forged an unbreakable sword that will slash through all those that resist us. Today, we have voted for the creation of the International Brigades.\n\nToo much of humanity toils under the slavish conditions of the bourgeoisie, still. Our Comintern united the socialist world, but there is still so much work to do. When - and it is a question of when - the workers rise against their masters, we will be there. A force of only the most elite collection of soldiers from across the planet will assist the Revolution, no matter where or when. Trained to the limits of human endurance; armed with only the deadliest weaponry, they will be killing machines. Not against our fellow man, but against those that seek to destroy us.

When a worker's revolution broke out, they would have been sent to assist and train the workers in their fight against the Reactionary pigs of Fascism and Capitalism.\n\nUnfortunately, this has proven too resource-intensive for most of the Comintern. Whether it was fear of Capitalist \"retribution\" - if you call the suppression of our emancipation that - or lack of funds, resources or men to spare, the International Brigades Act is nothing more but a flight of fantasy. Some of our older members remember the original International Brigades. A gathering of all sorts. All languages and cultures came together and fought for their Spanish comrades. In the baking plains under the Iberian sun, they were slaughtered so far from home by the Francoist dogs and their masters in Germania.

We will assist them with their struggle against the reactionary forces. Now is not the time for factionalism or politicking - but a time of iron will and blood.\n\nFortunately, our compatriots agree. They have passed the resolution through and have ratified it in its entirety. Already, the resolution has caused shockwaves across the international geopolitical scene. While the capitalists - and their reactionary dogs of fascism and imperialism - may rage against the passing of the resolution, there is nothing they can do about it.

The Capitalists are mocking our indecisiveness while their butchers cut through our comrades with startling ease. While we can only hope for the best; many of our members fear that their revolution is doomed. At least without our help. The Military Assistance Resolution - if it had passed - would have meant sending vital military supplies to the target in question. Military Aid, in this case, would have meant anything from vital caches of weapons to fresh volunteers, all too eager to fight for their comrades.\n\nHowever, we have allowed ourselves to fracture. Some question the usefulness of a pan-Socialist organisation if it fails to help other Socialist nations in desperate need. Others say that getting ourselves bogged down in a conflict without end would only weaken our resolve to the world. Whatever the case, it seems that this revolt must fight its battles alone.

We will be picked apart by vultures, and only the Sun will watch over our bones.\n\nThis is why choosing a new leader of the Comintern is so crucial to our efforts. As the second most powerful nation in the Comintern, the General Assembly has chosen our nation to become the new head of the Socialist Revolution. Now the torch has been passed to us, and we have become the Arsenal of Socialism. Recovering from such a defeat will take everything we have, and our enemies will not make it easy for us.
