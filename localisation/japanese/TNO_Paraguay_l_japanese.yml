 Paraguay_Che_desc: "Ernesto 'Che' Guevara's life has been defined by a love for revolution - a love supplied by a voracious curiosity that has ferried him across capitalist nations and Marxist ideologies, old friendships, and new wars. Once a radical youth hopeful for a peaceful transition to Communism, Che's revolutionary beliefs took root amid the shed blood of the Colombian Civil War, when Communist sectarianism trapped millions in years of cyclical violence. Che left Colombia a changed man: one who would live and breathe his ideology.\n\nAfter training in the jungles of Yucatán, Che accompanied Fidel Castro from initial defeat at the Granma to final victory in Havana. In Cuba, he became famous for his energetic, ruthless dedication to the communist cause, often calling votes among his fellow revolutionaries to decide upon a captive's execution, and never failing to stare into the eyes of the men judged for death by the vanguard of the people.\n\nSince leaving Cuba, Che has traveled South America as a wandering guerilla, offering instruction to budding revolutionaries and forging them into the bones of stout liberation movements, as with the FULNA. Now, having endured imprisonment in Chile and the violence of the Paraguayan takeover, Che refuses to abandon his fractious, volatile revolution for fear that it will deviate as Cuba's did. Certainly, this itinerant revolutionary still has much to do."

 PAR_invasion.1.t: "小さな島で大きな話題"
 PAR_invasion.1.desc: "The small size of Martín García Island made the disproportionate presence of military facilities within it look almost comical. Still, the small 2 kilometer island, by virtue of its presence at the mouth of the La Plata River, was zealously guarded by the Argentine military, and in turn disputed by Uruguay.\n\nToday, however, it was a place where the master of the Plate came for agreement, and not dispute. Indeed, few could have imagined a situation under which the arrival of a Brazilian Air Force plane to the island's rugged airstrip would be so well received. For Colonel Carlos de Meira Mattos, the plane's passenger, that was also the case. As a rising star of the Brazilian military, Mattos had sooner expected to be invading the island than negotiating in it.\n\nAnother man who would rather go to war with his interlocutor than discuss with him was Eduardo \"Bocha\" Uriburu, recently promoted to brigadier general and commander, and perhaps the most serious exponent of nationalism in the Argentine Army. Begrudgingly accompanying foreign minister Mario Amadeo, Uriburu saluted the Brazilian colonel, as he had the two Uruguayan generals, Omar Porciúncula and Hugo Tiribocchi, who had arrived by boat from Colonia a few hours earlier.\n\nOfficers from the naval and aeronautic services, as well as foreign ministry bureaucrats of all three countries, now assembled at the Naval Headquarters building, turned from formalities to the discussion of the issue which had become so pressing as to force their cooperation: The black sheep of the Plate, Paraguay.\n\n\"As stipulated in our memorandum to the Brazilian and Uruguayan foreign ministries, the triumph of communism in Paraguay would be unacceptable to Argentina. However, we would not wish to act against it in such an eventuality without the acquiescence and indeed help of our neighbours.\" Amadeo, himself a known paragon of Nacionalismo, was nevertheless an intelligent operator of geopolitics, and his willingness to use the mechanisms of consultation that had become more common after the War was perhaps what made him such a useful person to have at the Argentine foreign ministry.\n\n\"While we would not like precipitated action - we in the Brazilian military cannot acquiesce to a government of those characteristics in Paraguay, either.\" Mattos let out smoke from his cigarette while a pair of Itamary sycophants nodded their heads in recognition of the military's control of foreign policy. \"This needs more detailed discussion.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\" Amadeo's response was filled with a smug, and somewhat resentful sense of affirmation that the intervening translator did her best to attenuate. \"None of us wants a repeat of 1870.\""

 PAR_invasion.2.t: "Partitioning Paraguay"
 PAR_invasion.2.desc: "Since the first meetings at Martín García began a few months earlier, the representatives of the still-hypothetical Triple Alliance's militaries had become somewhat enamored of their task. Indeed, some might have not-incorrectly been accused of hoping for a communist victory in Paraguay so as to ensure all their preparatory work did not go to waste.\n\nAmongst the Argentine representatives in particular, there was some belief that such an eventuality may achieve a permanent solution to the problem of Paraguay as a geopolitical entity. Indeed, over the intervening months, their efforts had been directed more towards assuring Argentina the lion's share of Paraguay's population center as an occupation zone. However, they had been forced to concede by Brazilian intransigence that the capital, Asunción, would fall within the Uruguayan zone of occupation. Perhaps the most common trait among the Argentine negotiators was a deep resentment of Brazilian's double-cross at the end of the last Paraguayan war, which they seemed determined to avoid.\n\nIn part due to this unusual war-lust on the part of General Uriburu, the Brazilian colonels present at the meetings had become somewhat reluctant to go forward with the project. They were only dissuaded from doing so by the arrival of General Albuquerque-Lima, an anti-communist hardliner if there ever was one. Nevertheless, the newly arrived general seemed more interested in laying out plans for a return to normalcy in Paraguay, including its full restoration as an independent state.\n\nAs for the Uruguayan diplomatic and military staff which took part in the meeting, they were clearly divided in two camps. The Nationalists surrounding Porciúncula were having the time of their lives talking about how at home they would be seen as heroes, while the Liberals under Tiribocchi were increasingly dismayed by the tendency of both Uriburu and Albuquerque-Lima of considering expressions and tendencies of the Paraguayan opposition, which were perfectly normal aspects of Uruguayan politics, as communistic enough as to justify an intervention on their own right. Either way, their first priority was to make sure the Nationalists didn't get all the credit, to avoid the disaster that would be a Nationalist takeover of the Armed Forces. Their neighbors' lack of respect for Uruguayan sovereignty was a future problem."

They're getting anxious about Paraguay, and whether we intervene or not, Argentine boots will cross the border. It will not be now, but it will be soon.\" Argemiro, Goulart's Minister of War, pleaded.\n\n\"So what? You want me to invade to appease the Army? Jesus in Heaven, they already want to kill me, Argemiro. They'd strangle me with this very phone cord, you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand sir! But a Red Paraguay is too much to handle for most of the General Staff. If we let Argentina carve up Paraguay, they would be pointing a dagger straight at our hearts. Please, sir, I am begging you. Just sign the order. Don't think of this as an invasion, think of this as a humanitarian intervention!\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't realise you were related to the Dulles Brothers!\" Goulart sighed, rubbing his forehead. \"Eugh, I will talk to you later. In-person, next time.\"\n\nGoulart put down the telephone and rested his arm on his head. Looking outside, Goulart couldn't help but wonder.

Only to retain control over the fact that he would wake up tomorrow the President of Brazil - and not some prisoner to the OFN lapdog junta that would take over.\n\nNow, he had to fight to keep control over that fact. And if Argemiro said was true, so would the rest of the country. Paraguay had done nothing wrong to him or Brazil. Not in particular. But particulars didn't matter.

Stepping from the shadows of the Paraguayan jungle, Che Guevara has revealed himself to be the true leader of the FULNA.\n\nThe situation has taken a turn for the absolute worse. Che openly talks of the entire continent following in the same path as Paraguay. His precise whereabouts are unknown, but it would not be a surprise if revolutionary cells have already been trained to raise hell. Dealing with terrorism in our borders would be a fool's errand when the black, rotten heart is within our grasp.\n\nTo confront the future, one must turn to the past. A renewal of a Triple Alliance to confront the Paraguayan threat must be revived. Already, plans for talks in Montevideo have begun to discuss the next move. With Argentina all in, it will only be a matter of time until Brazil and Uruguay join the coalition. It seems that if Che wants a People's War, he will certainly get one."

How was a very simple matter, and was for the General Staff of the Triple Alliance to figure out. The more troublesome issue was what to do afterwards.\n\n\"The Liberals-Febristas are our only option if we want to keep Paraguay from collapsing in on itself,\" a Brazilian diplomat pointed to large shaded dots straddling the border of Paraguay and its neighbours. \"We may have to provide some assistance if things go too badly for them, in governing. A neutral Paraguay governed by the Liberals-Febristas would do the job.\"\n\n\"Why do we need to give Paraguay up? We can simply agree to a splitting of the nation and go our separate way, surely? Restoring Paraguay after such a transgression like this, it's insane to me,\" the Argentine counterpart retorted. Many of the Argentine - and even some of the Brazilian - team nodded and murmured in agreement.\n\n\"Invading a sovereign country is one thing. Keeping hold of it is most certainly another. You want to fight a deeply unpopular guerilla struggle against Che's forces, go for it. But restoring the country is the cheapest, most reliable option for all of us,\" the Brazilian retorted.\n\nThe Argentine diplomat fell silent and pointed to Asunción.\n\n\"What about the heart of it all, then? Unless you want all of us, shoulder to shoulder sharing the city, something needs to be done.\"\n\n\"Give it to us, then,\" an Uruguayan general interrupted. \"You two would tear each other apart over Asunción.

Of course, everyone wanted an agreement. It just had to be on their terms.\n\n\"So you agree with our terms then? You get to occupy Paraguay, but we retain the occupation of Asunción? Would this not be the fairest way to carve it up?\" the Brazilian responded. The room grew quiet once more.\n\n\"You want us to be shot at by Che's merry band of guerillas, while you get to loot Asunción? Why not seize Buenos Aires, if you're so desperate?\"\n\nThe Uruguayan representative stepped forwards, brandishing a highlighter. Silently, he drew a line straight through Paraguay. In the South, it was marked with an A - Argentina. In the North, B was drawn on, for Brazil. Then he drew a small circle around Asunción. U for Uruguay.\n\n\"Take it or leave it.

That is to ensure that Bolshevism remains an obscure, dying ideology, and it will never become anything more than a historical oddity that birthed itself from the frothing, brutal death of the Tsar's Empire.\n\nThe conditions agreed upon are simple. If the Bolsheviks were to ever win their civil war in Paraguay, then this would pose the gravest security risk to the entire continent. Therefore, the only recourse of action must be equally as dramatic. The formation of a new, renewed Triple Alliance against Paraguay must be created.

We put a stake through Che's heart, and we brought peace to the Continent. I do not know what's going on in Africa but South America? We proved ourselves to the world. Say what you want, but we aren't pushovers.\"\n\n\"A little dramatic, but I agree. Paraguay is ours now. I keep getting reports of so-called partisan attacks, however. A good 80% turn out to be sightings or overzealous soldiers seeing a village boy with a gun. Or in one case, a schoolboy prank. Dressed up in ghillie, and armed themselves with a bunch of fireworks. Nearly got shot by their comrades. And quite rightly too.\"\n\n\"The other 20%? What do they turn out to be?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Figueiredo said, shaking himself out of his trance. Banging his glass with a spoon, he silenced the room. \"Comrades! We've done well for a group of sorry bastards! Yet, where would we be without our beloved President? He is a collective pain in our asses and supposedly the worst poker player in the Southern Hemisphere! But... he is the one who killed Bolshevism in Latin America.\"\n\nFigueiredo raised his glass, along with Frota and the rest of the room."

 PAR_invasion.12.t:0 "A Horrific Disaster"
 PAR_invasion.12.desc:0 "General Figueiredo took a swig from his bottle of champagne. From French Africa - or at least what remained of it. It was the most peculiar mix of acute sweetness, and one of the toughest drinks he'd ever swallowed. It was as if the sweetness was corroding away at his insides, bit by bit. Considering it came from De Gaulle's tiny fiefdom, it probably was a relief to those who purchased it.\n\nThere was no possible way that Guevara could have won, like he did. Everything and anything was stacked up against him. Not a single factor could have played in Guevara's favor. Manpower, quality of weapons, tactics. Yet, every patrol mission would end up with the men coming back in pieces, or not at all. Guerillas disappeared into thin air, every time Search and Destroy missions were conducted, and the men who conducted them would normally find themselves at the end of a punji trap. It was inexcusable, it was impossible and it all happened right in front of his eyes.\n\nThe General took another swig from his bottle. The photos of the bodies were the worst part. Bones jutting out of places that he never even knew existed. Collections of limbs and extremities in piles up to his stomach, all lying impaled on feces-ridden stakes. The eyes, oh they were by far the worst part. They weren't just another body part. They were the last snapshot into the psyche of boys - just boys - sent on a mission, with no possible hope of success. Whether they were attached or not to the body, the eyes always seemed to face the camera. They didn't tell a story of heroes falling in battle with the enemy, or an unfortunate accident that couldn't be prevented. No. Those corpses knew who their killer was, who had made sure that thousands of parents would never be able to hold their child's hand again. He had sinned, and all of South America would know it.\n\nAnother swig. The Generals were not to be blamed here. They were simply carrying out orders, weren't they? From high above, from the man ordained by the people of Brazil himself. The President kept sending more men to die, because if he didn't, then what would the death of the last man be for? He was the butcher of thousands. The General's hands were drenched in death, and it was not even him who trespassed against humanity. No, he had not sinned. But the President had."

 PAR_invasion.402.desc:0 "Frota thumbed Figuereido's number into his personal landline. Was it one-seven-six then... no of course not. The Brazilian General put two fingers up to his temple, closing his eyes. What was his number, again? He had it saved somewhere, but the cleaner must have thrown it out. Of all days to forget someone's number. Frota stumbled through all the possible combinations out there; until he was greeted by a deep, scratchy voice asking for his identity.\n\n\"It's Frota here. You saw the news, I assume? What the hell does he want from us? From Paraguay? I know the Germans of all people are not keen on Socialism, but why here?\" Frota said. Reaching over, he switched off the radio, where Albert Speer continued to read out an obviously pre-prepared speech.\n\n\"I know why they support us. Thing is, I don't think Buenos Aires does. I just got off the phone, from my contact in the Argentine military. Met him at a New Year's party at Rosario. Nice man. Absolute lightweight, though. He's saying that they're treating this as a positive! Champagne out and everything.\" Figuereido said.\n\n\"What? Parties? We're going to be invading a sovereign nation, not celebrating a fucking Bar Mitzvah.\" Frota sighed.\n\n\"I know, but you tell them that. Regardless, it seems that Germany wants to spread their wings over our fair continent. They're posturing again as they did after the war. Except then, that was just in Europe and the Near East. I don't know what happened in Europe, and I don't want to, but I can tell you that it will not be good for us. Not one bit. I have to go now. I'll catch up with you later.\"\n\nFrota put down the receiver. This was... complicated; to say the least. It was an absolute fact that Germany had agents all across South America, and especially in Paraguay. Even after Che's conquest, the network was bound to at least remain partially intact. Yet, this was a Faustian deal that they'd been forced into accepting. Washington was always the goal for Frota. No superpower would benefit Brazil, like America would, and they would mostly keep out of Brazilian affairs. Mostly. Speer had forced their hand, forced their gratitude even. It would come back to haunt them. But for now? They were comrades in arms."

 PAR_invasion.802.t:0 "A Heart of Concrete"
 PAR_invasion.802.desc:0 "There Germania was. Speer walked around his model Germania, still in perfect condition. Thirty years now. Thirty years had passed since the golden days of his life. Showing his Führer the wonders of a world yet to come, every single awe and stunned nod of his head was a badge of pride for the old architect. An idea - as solid and sincere; as the concrete, it was composed of - just out of reach. It was like seeing a reflection of something in the water, just ever so close to reality. But never quite there.\n\nGermania was the heart of everything. As Germania withered and crumbled, so did the Reich. But as the metropolis bustled and gleamed, so did Europe. News had come in of Paraguay's crushing defeat today. He made sure that every single newspaper in the still-habitable places of the Reich knew about it. It would never be the same as before; Che's lasting legacy to Paraguay. He mourned the death of Fascism, but Speer took solace in the fact it would be sharing its tomb with its killer. Bolshevism would never stain South America with its decadence anymore.\n\nIt didn't matter that the nations of South America would prefer to lap at the shining shoes of Washington. No, it would not matter. An architect never left things up to the last minute. German agents, embedded deep within Argentina, would convince them to... reconsider. They would see the light, the glamour of the glittering spotlights of Germania. They would see Germany's drive against all that opposed it, even when the odds were against it. They would see themselves in the Reich. A nation besieged on all sides by their inferiors. A continent that was rightfully theirs but held back by the world powers. A world; all too ripe to receive their majesty. All they needed was a leader. Like Hitler in the 1930s. Like himself, right now.\n\n\"My Führer,\" Gehlen entered the room. \"Our agents have discovered reports that say Argentina and Brazil both seek to move closer to Washington. Even after all our assistance, they still deny our overtures to them. What should we do?\"\n\nGehlen looked more confident. Slicked back hair, clean-shaven and eyes covered by a set of sunglasses. The Spider was completely in control of his web, with every last tapering limb under control of each delicate string. Yes, Germania was the heart of the world. And the Führer was the only one who could keep it pumping."

Guevara was right there; they could have shot, bombed or done anything! Why is he still alive, Director?\"\n\nGehlen kept silent. Speer was right, wasn't he? The Argentines and Brazilians, as they spoke, were scrambling out of Paraguay, leaving anything and everything behind them. There wasn't a single doubt in his mind left about the fact the German - his - assets in the region were dead. Perhaps not now, perhaps not until years later. But they were gone. If he had trained them well, it would be by their own hands.\n\n\"My Führer, you cannot blame yourself for this. We gave the Brazilians and Argentines maps, unit positions, photos, everything. Everything that they required to complete their mission. They failed. No-\"\n\n\"You're right, Gehlen. I don't blame myself for this. I blame you.\" Speer stood up from his seat. Hobbling towards the nearest window, he looked out of Germania. Gehlen recognised Speer's expression. It was that look of men whose defeat was snatched out of the jaws of victory.\n\n\"My Führer, German intelligence is not at fault here. Guevara -\"\n\n\"You have children, Gehlen?\" Speer interrupted, still looking outside. \"You don't need to answer that question. Do you realise what happens if we continue to make blunders like these? If we allow Bolshevism - which should have died with that bastard Bukharin - to prosper across the planet? What happens to Germany, and its people, if we fail to do our jobs?\"\n\n\"What, my Führer?\" Gehlen said.\n\n\"We are all dead, Director. Washington will dig our graves, and Tokyo will give the eulogy. Bolshevism will kill everything you love, and if we continue to fail, we will build our tombs. You may as well take your children and shoot them in the back of the head. One by one. The alternative is so much worse.\" Speer said. With his back towards Gehlen, he waved him away."
