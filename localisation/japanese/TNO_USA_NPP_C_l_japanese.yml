 USA_rfk_64_support_campaign_desc:0 "This administration has operated in full understanding that it beholds itself to the needs of the people. We do not function without a mandate from those who had and had not voted for us in November of 1964. Any act we undertake must have the support of a good majority of Americans; unfortunately, many still remain doubtful, even hostile, to our platforms for a wide assortment of reasons. A weak mandate inevitably leads to weak government, in turn leading to an undoing of what it had thus far accomplished.\n\nTo prevent such a scenario, White House strategists have planned a comprehensive information and awareness campaign in the coming months. This will involve everything we have at our disposal -- media outlets, loyal pundits and personalities, grassroots activists, even President Kennedy himself -- addressing the American people's concerns in person and on the airwaves. With this comes the hope that more Americans join the NPP's ranks, providing the administration with their full support for its legislative agenda."

Anyone can become whoever they wish to be, provided they work in earnest for it. In contrast, a sickly society leaves little room for free expression and social mobility: everyone has a place and appropriate standing, whether they like it or not.\n\nIn America, that place is dictated by a man's dollars -- earn too little, and they cannot dedicate themselves to anything but making enough to get by. It stifles the faculties and puts undue stress onto the working man, but more importantly it foments dissent which simmers into a violent, caldera-breaking boil.\n\nThis can be prevented with a robust network of benefits and pensions which they can rely on to make ends meet. Although President Kennedy had promised such, whether or not he can back rhetoric with action in the face of bipartisan backlash remains to be seen."

Poor farmers in both his home state and across the country utter his name in the same breath as the Lord God, thanking him for the protection his United Farm Workers bestowed upon them and tens of thousands of others.\n\nThe Administration cannot negotiate in good faith with American labor without approaching the representatives it acknowledges -- for much of it, Señor Chavez is nothing less than a blessed idol.

For those America's police had sworn to serve and protect, however, their motto rings hollow. In many infamous incidents, they had neither served nor protected the American people -- instead, they served those with the money to acquire their services, and protected the assets which they deeply prize.\n\nSecuring the backing of the American worker entails ensuring their safety from their own law enforcement, that they may not tread upon their rights like they had in the past.

For some, this country fulfilled their end of the bargain, and so they and theirs lived happily thereafter.\n\nSadly, this was not a common occurrence. A great many others lived lives no different from what they had left behind: miserable, pathetic, pauperous. Too many suffered the same withering glares they longed to escape, whether for their race, faith or sex. Too many died with only a gravestone to their name. To our great shame, this \"land of opportunity\" favored a select few and left the rest to wail and gnash teeth.\n\nPresident Kennedy aspires to bring America closer to what it had promised, legislation by legislation.

So say the Nationalist, the clear solution is to press the regulations on a national scale, but allow certain exemptions at the state level so that more traditional industries can keep their overhead manageable. This, along with some other business-friendly amendments, would take the harsh bite out of the bill in the eyes of many businesses and business interests.\nWe need support to get our radical plan through, and perhaps allowing a few dissenters to cut themselves loose of the regulations is acceptable if most of the nation will still follow them.

He'd tried to negotiate in good faith with Thurmond's reactionaries and this was the price he'd had to pay. It was better than nothing, but not much better. He'd gone into this trying to achieve the dream of equality for every American, and that dream had been sacrificed on the bloody altar of realpolitik.\n\nThe President sighed, holding his head in his hands.

Party sentiment appears to be heavily with the President as all across the nation calls have begun for major members of the Nationalist faction to step down. This is just the latest in a string of major disappointments for the faction, and appears to be the capstone on their declining influence within the NPP. Whether or not the faction successfully weathers this scandal remains to be seen, but it is unlikely they will hold significant influence within the party in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the Oval Office, President Kennedy puts down his newspaper and smirks."

With this telegram, he could seriously cripple the Nationalists by paying for airtime on radio stations in key areas where the Nationalists went up against the Republicans or the Democrats, boosting the RDC in the public opinion and taking votes from the Nationalists. Combined with the fallout from the ballot-stuffing scandal, this media blitz could have the power to crush the Nationalists' influence in the NPP.\n\nHe looked back down at the telegram.

Restricting redlining will be very unpopular with business owners and bankers, as well as the wider white population in general, but the unpopularity of our policies has never stopped us from trying to do the right thing before.\n\nTo deal with redlining, we could either do what's right and go hard on banning the practice, erasing every loophole, or we could try and preserve some of our political capital and put some small but meaningful restrictions into place instead.

This morning, one such incident arising from integration pushback appeared on the front page of President Kennedy's newspaper, making him grimace from something other than his morning grapefruit.\n\nApparently, a pair of black teenagers whose family has recently moved into a previously redlined suburb in Atlanta attempted to order lunch at the local greasy spoon diner and the owner, one Lester Maddox, refused to serve them and asked them to leave. Despite this obviously being illegal since the passing of the Civil Rights Act, Maddox's supposed right to choose his customers has become Dixie's cause du jour, and Maddox has already appeared on several right-leaning Southern radio stations bemoaning the sudden change in his community's demographic makeup.\n\nWe have to respond to this quickly before it spirals out of control, to make it publicly known that the regressive racism of Maddox and his ilk has no place in modern America. However, despite being a thoroughly unpleasant man, Maddox has gained a strong measure of support from Southern whites and reactionaries everywhere.

Nevertheless, this was the right thing to do. People need to understand that integration is the future and they need to accept it if they want to do business.

Placing his books down, he joined his father and his sisters at the table. Anthony's mother led them in saying grace, then served them all a plate of roast chicken with mashed potatoes as Anthony excitedly told them about his day and all the wonderful things they had at his new school.

Your choice, Bobby.\"\n\nKennedy tensed his fists under the table to stop himself from lashing out.

They'd been expecting it for weeks now, and it curiously made him feel nothing at all.\n\nFrank grunted and stood up, his knees cracking with the exertion. Twenty years of sitting behind a desk as a high school principal was not kind to one's joints. He shuffled past Barb and the kids, now in high school themselves, to his bedroom. Opening the closet and delving behind the winter coats, Frank pulled out the nondescript well-worn cardboard box he had first stashed there so many years ago.\n\nHe took the box into the backyard, into the cool South Carolina evening, and stood there for a moment, listening to the cicadas performing their nightly symphony.

Like a ghost in a Civil War battlefield he has returned to haunt us.\n\nEastland, through his aides, has demanded that we drastically scale back our anti-hate speech bill or he has threatened to leak to the press that we secretly collaborated with him and other prominent segregationists to pass our civil rights legislation. Civil rights wouldn't have happened without this necessary albeit unseemly alliance, but unfortunately the public aren't usually willing to excuse political pragmatism.\n\nIf this gets out, there's a strong chance we'll get annihilated politically. Our base will feel betrayed, our enemies will be emboldened, and we will forever be branded as duplicitous. The President's reputation and legacy could be irrevocably tarnished, and the Progressives' power substantially hurt. This is a black day for us.

In a sudden flash of movement he picked up the crystal tumblers on his drinks tray and flung them one by one against the wall, shattering them into a thousand sparkling shards that cascaded over the thick carpet of the Oval Office. He knew the Secret Service men out in the hall could hear, but he was past caring.\n\nThe phone rang, but he didn't pick up. Eastland, the racist old lizard, had outed the President's deal with the segregationists to get his civil rights bill through the Senate. The reaction, from the party, from the press and from the public has been about as bad as you'd expect. Kennedy had to force himself to stop watching the television and listening to the radio. All it did was make him feel worse.\n\nKennedy slumped back into his chair. The phone rang again, but he ignored it. The anti-hate speech bill got passed, but it has been a pyrrhic victory to say the least. The thought of his technical victory was of no consolation. Already his allies were calling for his head, and the party was collapsing into chaos as his enemies in Congress gloated and prepared to divide the spoils amongst themselves.\n\nKennedy reached for the scotch but drew back when he remembered he'd destroyed all the tumblers. The worst part of it all was that this would irrevocably taint his legacy. When the history books wrote about Robert Kennedy, President of the United States, this would be the standout moment. He wiped the moistness from his eyes, and wished that his brother was there to help him in his darkest moment. He wasn't sure if he was strong enough to get through this. What would John have done?\n\nThe President laid his elbows on the desk and laid his head in his hands."

Upon walking to the podium on the stage of the Capitol building, he was applauded by his supporters in the audience and, once the applause had stopped, he began his speech:\n\n\"My fellow Americans, we have all unified around the concept of freedom in a way I could never have thought possible. The passage of the Civil Rights Act is an extraordinary step forward for all of us but, today, our struggles are not over. While the equality we strive for has now been codified, we must maintain our commitment to the downtrodden across America and refuse to withdraw into complacency. Unfortunately, we must still come to terms with the root of the issue.\n\nAcross the country, the remnants of prejudice continue to fester, many unabated by the legislation we have passed. While the blatant and ugly efforts of states to segregate the races of America have been dashed, the echoes from earlier times have nonetheless persisted. To many, these institutions are a fact of life, for good or ill, but our nation was not founded on the principles espoused by America's founders. I call on all citizens of the United States to look at ourselves and our society critically, and question some of the things we take for granted. The un-American attitudes of racist groups have lost their stranglehold on politics, but that does not mean they have been vanquished for good.\n\nConfronting these uncomfortable aspects will not be comfortable or enjoyable, but it is something we must do as a nation if we ever plan to move forward.

In this life, however, they both had responsibilities pulling them apart, King's to his community and Kennedy's to the welfare of the nation. Nevertheless, they agreed on the absolute necessity for racial justice and that the right to equality is deserved by all Americans. King was no radical; he understood realpolitik and knew that Rome wasn't built in a day, but the President could still see the yearning for a better future behind King's eyes.

Talking with Malcolm X was, thought Kennedy, rather like being hit in the face repeatedly by a medieval mace. After a youth spent as a petty criminal, Malcolm X had found religion in prison with the Nation of Islam, quickly becoming the organization's public face and a major spokesperson for racial justice. Though differing from many other black leaders due to his racial separatist ideals, Malcolm X has over time become one of the most prominent and outspoken figures fighting for racial equality.\n\nNot to mention the most controversial, no matter which side of the debate you're on. As he sipped his coffee (wine, of course, would be haram), listening to Ethel and Malcolm's wife Betty exchanging stilted small talk at the other end of the table, Kennedy wondered if meeting with Malcolm X had been such a good idea. Malcolm X seemed skeptical, and frankly, Kennedy couldn't blame him. After hundreds of years of getting sidelined by white politicians, why should Malcolm X trust him? Kennedy wished he could somehow show the man what lay in his heart, his genuine commitment to justice, to racial equality, to bettering the lives of African-Americans.\n\nIn the end, both men left feeling frustrated. Kennedy wondered if it had been a foregone conclusion as the phone began to rang, an incensed Thurmond on the other end."

This would not be a speech for Wyoming, nor Montana or Idaho or any other state. This would be a patriotic rallying cry to all America, reminding us where we all come from, and what we all call home.\n\n\"Today, I find myself not speaking to the common people of the United States, but rather the messengers to whom they listen. That does not matter. I stand here, in one of the most peaceful, beautiful places our great nation has to offer, to say that no matter how divided we may seem, we are still an indivisible union, connected through soulful bonds that may never be torn apart. Every year, millions of people visit this place. As such, it remains, and forever shall remain one of the great bonds that tie our union together. We are a nation of one people, one heritage. Regardless of race or creed or color, we are not simply Americans, we are America itself.\"\n\n\"Standing in such a place as this, we may be reminded of the words of our forebear John Winthrop to his shipmates aboard the Arabella, as they were traveling to the New World, for a new life.

Today, as always, the eyes of all people remain upon us, anxiously studying the American Experiment. Be it through our politics or our culture or our faiths, in all levels of government we must be constructed of men and women of resolute strength, aware of the trust placed in them by God and the freedom-loving peoples of the world. Our endeavors, as with the men of the Arabella's endeavors, will not be judged upon the basis of the color of our skin, nor the nature of our God, nor the ideology to which we owe allegiance; rather, we will be judged by the world be build for future generations, be it terrible, or righteous.\"\n\nAn hour or so later, once the reporters had asked their questions and the few tourists and shaken the President's hand, Bobby Kennedy returned to the Lincoln Continental he had been driven to Yellowstone in.

Bobby Kennedy shuffled his papers on the podium and began to speak.\n\n\"People of Portland, I see among you many expectant faces.

Many of your industrial sectors are also under duress, and with such difficult times upon us recently, it is no wonder that the main line of American politicians have failed you in leadership.

In divided times, such as we find ourselves in presently, it is easy to see only the name of the party, and not the name of the man who follows it. It is easy to dismiss someone as 'other' because of the party line. However, I say that a man is loyal to his own convictions, and, as such, should not be judged upon the party with which he sides. I see the actions and policies of your Congressman Lyndon Johnson and I am moved and inspired by them.

So, together, I believe that the Republican-Democrats and the Progressives may yet carry the torch of Civil Rights not individually, but together.\"\n\nBobby continued to give short speeches intermittently with Lyndon Johnson, as well as the Governor of Texas John Connally, for more than an hour.

As for 'dividing his state', I do not believe his state was ever behind him in the first place. As I recall, the last gubernatorial election in Alabama had a little over 300,000 registered white voters, and less than 20,000 black voters, even though black people comprise a quarter of Alabamans. When election day rolled around, there were almost 290,000 votes cast by white voters, and less than 2,000 by black ones. Draw your own conclusions from that, but I say that I could not divide the State of Alabama against George Wallace because it never truly was united behind him in the first place.

By creating a system by which the government can dole out financial benefits to retired or disabled citizens, Kennedy has promised to create a safety net that any American can fall back on once they can no longer take care of themselves. To prevent widespread abuse of these benefits, the age at which citizens are eligible to start collecting money has been set to 65.\n\nAlready, critics of Social Security have spoken out in protest of the bill, accusing the act of being heavily flawed. Chief among their complaints is the mandatory contribution by Americans to maintain the system, which they say creates another unneeded burden on the working class. Still others have called it an example of excessive government overreach, something many Americans see as dangerous.

Through welfare programs, outreach programs, or other means, both have shown a commitment to using federal money to give aid to those who need it most.\n\nOne way President Kennedy has now actively pursued these goals is through the funding of food banks. Through earmarks, categorical grants, and other means, he has recently cooperated with Congress to send million of dollars to food banks and shelters in all parts of the United States. Millions of dollars from the federal government will now be used to provide meals to America's poor so no American goes hungry.\n\nThis act has garnered widespread support from both sides of the political aisle, with many praising his initiative. Democratic lawmakers, have been especially supportive, with many voting for and often supporting President Kennedy's food bank programs. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson specifically rallied many of these politicians to support the funding initiative, which he has said aligns closely with his own goals."

Civil Rights has been one of the most divisive issues in American discourse this century, and it is time to finally put it to rest by passing a strong Act to end the practice once and for all.\n\nOur supermajority in congress means President Kennedy will face no challenges there, giving us a lot of freedom in deciding the final contents of the Civil Rights Act. While congress won't pose any difficulties, however, our own party might prove trickier to handle. The Nationalist wing is already concerned about their waning influence, and are firmly against Civil Rights. We can't let them stop us from passing a strong bill, of course, but we might want to show a modicum of restraint in how fast and hard we push desegregation. They still command a lot of influence in the Southern States. Influence which, if we push them too hard, they might turn against our administration.\n\nWe have three drafts for consideration. All of them end the practice of segregation, ban Jim Crow laws and prohibit discrimination of Americans on the basis of color. The first of the drafts contains no further provisions. The second option aims to also empower the disenfranchised by mandating equal representation in state senates and positions and equal funding for schools. The third and most radical of the drafts aims to also counter the effects of segregation by mandating action policies for political offices, all official institutions, university admissions, and officer ranks in the military. All three options will surely anger the Nationalists, but the more radical drafts are sure to cause a much stronger reaction. How far shall we go?"

After all the talks, and the schmoozing, and the gladhanding, and the endless fucking heart-rending compromises, Thurmond and his goons were just going to dig their heels in the mud and refuse to move, like an ornery camel. All that work wasted, just so the right-wingers of the party could keep their flagging dream of a segregationist future alive. So much for bipartisanship.\n\nBipartisanship. Kennedy narrowed his eyes as an idea formed. Drumming his fingers on his desk, he wondered if this was entirely wise. If he did this, he would forever alienate the rightists by cutting them out of the legislative process of his administration.\n\nEh, fuck 'em, he thought.

Why is it that in a country with the grandest skyscrapers, and all the land to build and grow communities, still have tens of thousands of homeless people? Why is it in a nation with the best schools and hospitals that even our enemies leaders send their children to study in or to have their cancers cured, have illiteracy at all or have millions dying in pain and misery?\"\n\n\"The simple fact is that for far too long, we have expected every American to lift themselves up, to climb up and out of the deep trench of poverty by their own merits, strengths and abilities, to join the American Dream that we all share. That system, which we call a meritocracy and take such pride in, has a great flaw though. There are some people who, no matter how hard they work, how hard the struggle, how much they save, how careful they are with their health, are struck by the misfortunes of fate, and are cast down into that pit of despair, unable to scramble out. In the White House, I receive stories like these, every day via letter and telegram, as I visit every state and city and county. It is heartbreaking to want to help those that, through little or no fault of their own, have been pushed into that trench of poverty.\"\n\n\"So, instead I say let's help those that need it, everyone in that deep, dark hole that they were dumped into. Those that are sick, we should heal. Those that have been maimed, we should lift up. Those that are homeless, we should shelter. Those that are scraping by, we should give a helping hand.

And as the assembled congressmen and women sit in the House chamber, clad in black, they all know that yet another patch has been sewn.\n\nWorse, still, is the man newly sworn in as President. True, to some of those gathered, he's a hero. But to many others, \"President Strom Thurmond\" is a sick joke of a phrase. And yet, there he stands, balding head gleaming under the television lights and slick with sweat.\n\nHe doesn't speak about segregation or states' rights, to the relief of the countless enemies that he's already made. He acknowledges his unelected status, he says all the important shibboleths of unity and patriotism. He eulogizes Robert Kennedy, America's latest fallen prince. Without any knowledge of who Strom Thurmond is, the casual viewer might feel confident in this new President. Their anxieties might be soothed for the moment. But to those who know of him, this is a dark night of the soul without equal.

But in order to even begin the process of expanding healthcare to more people, Bobby has to get his party onside to support him, which is easier said than done. While everyone in the party is generally in favor of increasing health spending and getting more doctors and hospitals, it's the nitty-gritty details that are causing issues that will have to be dealt with.\n\nThere are three general directions the President can go: he can pitch his idea to cover the largest number of Americans as possible, an almost fully national health system that many other nations have been establishing around the world. The problem is that some of the more radical members of the Progressive Caucus may be a bit iffy about the more vague and generalized terms, and the fact that it wouldn't be a full, government run and managed health insurance system.\n\nPresident Kennedy can also focus on specific areas of the nation that have worse health systems due to their intrinsic poverty and lack of development, such as Mississippi and Alabama. While the Nationalists will undoubtedly support this measure, the lack of support in struggling cities in the north or rapidly growing cities in the west will be seen as a slap in the face.\n\nFinally, the President can instead focus this as a civil rights issue, that this new plan will help African Americans and other marginalized peoples in the US, as they are usually denied the same health coverage and benefits that white people so easily receive. Most of the party will support this measure, though it will come at the expense of support from the Nationalists, especially the segregationists that have already made such a nuisance and fuss over schools.\n\nAll in all, there is no easy answer, but Robert Kennedy has to make a choice."

He sat in the Oval Office, back to the Presidential Seal, looking into the lens. With a sharp breath, he began.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, I come to you today to share with you my vision for America. On my travels across this great nation, the world's richest, I have seen into the abyss of poverty that so many of our brothers and sisters are born into and die in, a miasma of depression from which there is no escape, even for the willing, who are not provided the tools and resources to better their lives. It is a fallacy, too often espoused by the callous and uncaring, that people who are in poverty choose to be there, or are rightfully deprived of the means to the pursuit of happiness due to their colour, or class, or faith. When any American denies to extend a helping hand to his fellow citizen, he denies America. Some are happy to turn their heads, or to snatch crumbs out of the mouths of the hungry, but I will not stand idly by while American children starve, while American women die in childbirth, while American workers are paid too little to support their families. We are better than that. We have the means to lift every American out of the depths of poverty, and I intend to make that beautiful dream a reality. In the coming years, my administration will dedicate itself to the creation of innovative new agencies and programs to provide much-needed welfare to impoverished Americans nationwide. We shall not rest until every American is provided the means to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, those three unalienable rights that have been denied to all too many. Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nIn his darkened mansion, a man watched the President's address. As Kennedy finished, his wrinkled, liver spotted hand lethargically reached for the receiver of the pristine white telephone sitting beside him. He dialled the long-familiar number and listened to the dial tone. When it finally connected, he said in his scratchy smoker's voice-"

However, the reality of the divisive and fractious politics within the National Progressive Pact, especially in the Centre faction, have been complicating matters. While they almost universally support Robert Kennedy as President, there are two wings that have their own interests and policy goals. While often allied on many issues, the few conflicting points are just that much harder to deal with.\n\nOn one hand, you have the union guys: labor leaders seeking to expand the power of workers' unions in the face of the big corporations and hostile moneyed interests, protecting and increasing the rights to collective bargaining, safer working conditions, and job security. On the other hand are the social welfare proponents: seeking to strengthen the \"safety net\" to catch those that fall through the cracks, tackling poverty and homelessness, and giving every American the chance to make a decent living, usually through higher taxes on the rich.\n\nThe problem is that it's damn near impossible to push both agendas at the same time, partially due to the opposition that would come from those rich and powerful fatcats that would rather keep their power over the workers and their vast fortunes away from those that need it. So that leaves the President with two options: either focus his political capital on trying to boost pensions for the public and private sector that will help unionized workers, or to increase the federal minimum wage to help those stuck on the bottom of society. While they are both good ideas, only one will be able to get through Congress easily. So who are we going to piss off this time?"

The docummenting of corruption, abuses, racism and violence by the men in blue from coast to coast has been well received and applauded by Civil Rights leaders, victims of police brutality, and those that have spent their careers trying to investigate the kickbacks, bribes, property seizures and more that happens every day, and how police unions protect bad cops and punish those that speak out. But the speech has also outrage from across the nation. Many citizens are considering what the President has said as little more than slander, painting all the cops in the nation based on a few bad apples. Police unions from New York to Los Angeles are in an uproar, denouncing the President and vowing to use their resources to support politicians that actually give a damn about the police and public safety.\n\nEven in the National Progressive Pact, RFK has received major blowback. Some in the Nationalist caucus have denounced the President, saying that he's not patriotic enough to support those that preserve law and order. Some have even shifted their loyalty from the NPP to the Republicans in response. Meanwhile, some members of the Progressive caucus, especially those that are really more concerned with the threat posed from outside the nation by Japan and fascism than with civil rights in America, are moving into the Nationalist camp, thinking that the President has gone too far. After all, police forces from the FBI to county sheriffs have been busy trying to root out the dangers of spies and agitators, and it's not helping to have their methods and motives questioned.\n\nNeedless to say, the speech may have done a lot to expose the bad aspects of the men (and the slowly increasing number of women) who police the nation and their power, but the political cost to Bobby Kennedy could have been much stronger than he could have anticipated."

Hardly the most thrilling stuff.\n\nAs the Father's words washed over her like gentle, lulling waves, she found herself drifting away into vague consideration of the current political landscape. All they seemed to talk about on the radio were President Kennedy's new reforms, each more radical than the last. It had begun to worry her, significantly.

Extreme, even.\n\nClenching her jaw to stop her teeth chattering as Father Kendricks droned on, Clara wondered how many others in the congregation felt the same way. They weren't fond of segregation or authoritarianism, but a lot of President Kennedy's recent policy seemed haunted by the spectre of that thing most abhorred by the all-American suburbanite: socialism.\n\nMulling it over, Clara decided that it had been a good run, but having a Catholic in the White House might not be worth Kennedy's apparent turn towards the radical.

Looking around the room, she saw black and white children sitting together as though the barriers that had separated them for decades had never existed at all.\n\nAngie had never considered herself political until '64, when her family began speaking about Kennedy as though he was some kind of messiah.

A representative from the leftist faction of the NPP, Kennedy's patchwork quilt of a party, he said they were committed to civil rights and racial equality, that a significant portion of the party leadership were black.

Obviously he couldn't give them any real concessions, but perhaps it was a good idea to change his language, scale back the bombast, assure them his plan for civil rights wouldn't be as extreme as they feared?\n\nSipping, Kennedy leaned back in his chair, furrowing his brow as his brain dragged him one way and his heart another."

 bobby.justice.67.desc:0 "President Kennedy sat behind his desk, chin on hand, listening to Thurmond sharply criticise him and everything he stood for over the phone. Thurmond had a way of delivering the most unpleasant insults so they didn't sound like insults at all. Since he'd picked up his receiver to find Thurmond on the other end, Kennedy had received quite a few of them.\n\nUnderneath the subtle faux-politeness, Kennedy could tell that Thurmond was absolutely livid about the most recent speech he'd given in support of civil rights. The anger of the right-wingers had been growing for a while, and, to the President's irritation, this had apparently been the straw that broke the camel's back. He could feel Thurmond's fury radiating through the telephone like beams of radiation directly into his brain. As ever, Kennedy said as little as possible, to avoid aggravating Thurmond further. The less material fuelling the fire of that old Carolina devil, the better.\n\nSuddenly, Thurmond changed tack. \"You ever hear the story of Jason and the dragon's teeth, Mr. President?\" Without waiting for a response, seemingly knowing he had Kennedy off his guard, Thurmond continued, \"Ol' Jason, lookin' for that golden fleece, had to plant some dragon's teeth in the earth, like seeds, only when he did the teeth sprouted into unholy warriors who attacked him on sight. There's a moral to this story, Bobby: you reap what you sow. That's a message you'd do well to keep in mind.\"\n\nAs Kennedy drew breath to respond, the phone clicked as Thurmond hung up on him. Slowly, he put the phone back on the hook. It had been a while since Bobby had read the classics, but he seemed to remember Jason winning in the end.\n\nOf course, he thought as the memory returned, he'd had to pay a terrible price for it."

Realpolitik might leave everyone with a sour taste in their mouths, but sometimes you just had to do something it pained you to do, no way around it. The blacks in the party had more reason to detest the segregationist wing than anyone, but surely they had to realise there was no way the party could keep their hold on Capitol Hill without them?\n\nIn a sudden burst of pique, Kennedy screwed up the letter and tossed it into his wastebasket. Then, feeling a little ashamed, he fished it back out again and smoothed it on his desk. They were right to remind him that he wasn't the only voice that mattered in the party, that there can still be disagreements between allies. Even if it annoyed him to be spoken to in this way by people who should be batting for him, he had a duty to hear them out.\n\nAfter all, ignoring his African-American party brothers would make him hardly any better than Thurmond and Wallace. Dialling the ringleader's number, Kennedy stoutly reminded himself that they were fighting for the same cause."

The battle to pass the law has been a long and tough one, with opponents on all sides battling against the law as it was written.

But there are some members of the Progressives, and even further to the left, that say the bill doesn't go far enough: there will be some, like the elderly and disabbled, who will have to jump through hoops and may struggle to get the aid they need, so the restrictions should be even further loosened, and the payments increased even more.\n\nBut over all, it seems that most congressmen were willing to support the Social Security Act, which will expand the number of people that can receive it, cut the red tape that drains so much money from a system that is supposed to help people who have fallen on hard times or those too old to work any more, and not belittle and humiliate them. The SSA, first and foremost, is to be a safety net to catch those that fall through society's cracks: the poor, the homeless, the injured, the elderly.\n\nIn a statement released to the press after the announcement of the passing of the bill, President Kennedy said that he will be signing the law tomorrow to make it law, and thanked all those that voted in favor of the act for their \"...compassion, humanity, and care for the less fortunate in our nation that would otherwise be cast aside or ignored.\""

Some of those that voted in opposition to the SSA did so because they thought the bill wasn't enough, that even more generous payments to take care of the elderly, the injured, and the poor was needed.\n\nThe failed Social Security Act would have expanded the number of people that can receive it, cut the red tape that drains so much money from a system that is supposed to help people who have fallen on hard times or those too old to work any more, and not belittle and humiliate them.

But for now, the myriad of complicated federal, state and local social programs is all that will help those that need it most.\n\nIn a statement released to the press after the announcement of the failure of the bill, President Kennedy said that he was \"incredibly disappointed and saddened\" that the SSA would not be sent to the Resolute Desk, but thanked all those that voted in favor of the act for their \"...compassion, humanity, and care for the less fortunate in our nation that would otherwise be cast aside or ignored.\" The statement went on to say that he would do everything within his powers as President and the Executive branch to reform the welfare system, though without Congress' approval, there is little that could actually be done."

Strom and his cronies had trouble cooperating with anyone, the stubborn bastards, and the future of the NPP seemed in question.\nRepublicans or the Right, that was the question. Should he pick the Republicans, it could possibly dissolve the NPP as a whole; the \"big tent\" would be set on fire, so to speak. Regardless, a decision had to be made.

We're already radical enough in their eyes, if we don't at least make a gesture of getting along, the entire National Progressive Pact might just collapse away into dust.\"\nHarrington sighed, \"the more I ask you that the less confident I am that it's the right choice.\"\n\"Then why ask me? Listen, Strom and Byrd would absolutely rally behind you if we-\"\n\"If we what?\" Harrington interrupted, \"If we gave up on our campaign promises, you mean. Even then, Byrd would be a hard sell, and Thurmond's not even worth trying.\"\n\"Don't give up on him so easily,\" Howe replied, \"he's a dog with no bite. Throw him a bone and he won't even bark.\"\n\"The man said he'd 'sooner be in Tokyo with Tojo than in Hell with Harrington'. The Nationalists- and Thurmond- are a no-go.\"\n\"So,\" Howe began, \"Republicans it is, then.\"\n\"Republicans it is,\" agreed Harrington, reaching over to the phone.

Exquisite mahogany, carved, and surrounded by what must have been a little over a baker's dozen of politicians he all knew by name. McGovern, Dole, Rumsfeld, McNamara, Gore, Rockefeller, Ford, and several others. \"So, gentlemen,\" Harrington began, \"I've brought you all here today because I believe we share common interests, and may work together for those interests. I am officially asking for the support of the Republican-Democratic coalition going forward. Our administration needs more support to pass its legislation through Congress, and I am of the belief that an agreement between our two parties may be reached.\"\n\"So what do you want us to do?\" replied George McGovern, \"I'd be willing but I won't just blindly follow you.\"\n\"Think of it more as a bipartisan agreement for the common good,\" said Harrington.\n\"Absolutely not,\" interjected McNamara, \"you really think our party would rally behind you? When I tell this to the Democrats in Congress it won't be pretty.\"\nDole was the next to speak, \"hey, now, let's not be too hasty. Yes, the President here might have a few radical ideas but we could get some serious legislation passed with this alliance.\"\nSeveral murmurs of approval went up around the Republican side of the table, but the few Democrats remained silent until Donald Rumsfeld stood up. \"Listen to yourselves! You'd rather break up the coalition for some progressive pipe dream than focus on what really matters? I won't add any more fuel to this fire. Goodbye.\"\nWith that, he stood and walked out of the room, followed by McNamara and an inconsequential senator whom Harrington couldn't remember the name of. \"Let them go,\" said Bob Dole, \"they'll come around sometime or another. Mister President, I'm all for this alliance. Despite your more radical policies, I have great respect for you and your dedication to the well being of America. However, I'm not so sure my compatriots have such convictions. Please, give us a few minutes to discuss this.\"\nHarrington obligingly left the room, checking his watch every minute or so. Two minutes, four minutes, seven minutes, nine. It went on and on and on until suddenly the conference room door gently opened, with the entourage of Republicans filing out.

In addition, the Democrats have decidedly grown closer to the Nationalists in response. It appears that this sudden, extreme action is in response to a conference held between leaders of the Republican-Democratic Coalition and the Harrington Administration, in which the Republicans and the President agreed to work together. The few Democrats invited to the meeting, including Robert McNamara and Donald Rumsfeld, quickly left after they claimed the President was not interested in making compromises.\n\nThe new alliance between the Republicans and the Progressives is already visible in Congress, with the two groups voting almost unanimously on their legislative proposals. A fiery speech given by Strom Thurmond in the most recent Senate vote showed just how far the NPP has split over this issue, with Thurmond calling the President a \"traitor to the party\". Despite the large political shakeup, and the new counter-alliance seemingly between the Nationalists and the Democrats, it appears that most poor and middle class Americans are warming up to the Harrington Administration. The same however, cannot be said for their wealthier employers, who stand to lose millions from the President's social programs."

Passing his reforms in the Congress turned to be a very difficult task, encountering the inflexibility of the conservatives and even the moderates. So he decided that instead of dealing with an increasingly hostile Congress he would go back to his roots. A tour across the country will be organized to talk to the common folk and listen to their problems. This will allow to create popular support for his Progressive agenda and improve his image among those communities more hostile to him.\n\nThe reactions to the so called People's Path were mixed. Progressives applauded the President's decision of staying true to his ideals of being the \"People's President\" and they hope this tour can gain sympathy for the progressive cause. Some moderates sympathetic to Harrington's program voiced their concern about the project, arguing that the President should stay in Washington to focus on passing his reforms and deal with other problems. Non-progressives were more critical about it, defining the entire thing as nothing but a vanity project. Some conservatives went so far as to call the tour an attempt to \"create a socialist personality cult\".\n\nHarrington ignored the critiques and focused on organizing his ambitious tour. After all, these people bothered to put him in the White House. Why not return the favor?"

Harrington felt confident in his ability to speak to the poor: all those years of activism on his youth weren't in vain. \"Look, fellas. I'm not here to make a campaign or anything like that. There are no journalists, no photographers and not even bodyguards\" Harrington wasn't entirely honest with that one: they were two members of the Secret Service infiltrated inside the crowd to avoid any lunatic doing something funny. \"I'm not gonna tell you \"vote for me\" or any of that political crap. You tell me your names and I'm gonna sit on this chair and just listen to what you have to say.\"\n\nAt the exact moment that Harrington sat on the chair, a hundred hands raised up and the entire room filled with the voices of dozens of people. \"One at the time, please\" requested Harrington. A crippled man with a long beard went first: \"I'm Jack. I lost a leg fighting the Nazis in Wales. They rewarded me by screwing my fucking pension. I've been homeless for ten years.\" Another woman with small children on her lap was next: \"I'm Brenda. My landlord expelled me and my kids from my house. I don't know what do.\" Then, a young black man: \"I'm Terry. I'm a drug addict in recovery. People refuse to hire me and call me names on the street. I feel like I can't change anything.\" Every single one of the seventy souls inside the room started to tell their stories for the next two hours.\n\nHarrington was out for words at first but he finally got up from the chair to deliver an answer. \"This is outrageous. How can people suffer like this in the richest country on Earth? I'm gonna do everything I can to solve this and I'll resign in shame if I can't change anything!\" The entire room cheered him, as Harrington thanked the people for his support. Local newspapers tracked the people on the meetings weeks later, reporting that their situations have improved a lot since then. President Harrington's approval ratings went through the roof in New York, with a similar result in other big urban centers."

 harrington.9.desc:0 "After leaving behind the big urban centers behind, Harrington wanted to address the middle classes to further push his progressive agenda. This stop in particular was particularly com: a community in Florida filled with conservative middle-aged people, a place where Harrington is really unpopular. The speech was nothing special with Harrington talking about the importance of helping fellow citizens, specially the poor. Some voices of disapproval could be heard when Harrington talked about the importance of everyone doing their part to end poverty as it was interpreted as an attempt to raise taxes. The interesting part came when Harrington announced that he would be taking questions from the crowd. His aides warned him that it was a risky strategy: if the discussion gets heated, the right-wing press was going to eat him alive.\n\nFortunately, Harrington was ready for that. The questions were mostly conservative talking points that he already heard a million times, so he had no problem answering then. However, the moment that most resonated from the event was the exchange that the President had with one person in particular. An elderly man wearing a cross-shaped necklace asked: \"Why should I give my hard working money to lazy people that don't contribute anything to society, Mr President?\"\n\nHarrington decided to make a gamble with his response. \"I have noticed that you are a Christian, isn't it?\" The man nodded proudly. \"Well, while I admit I'm not a big religious person myself, I'm a bit familiar with Jesus's teachings. Didn't Jesus talked about the necessity of having compassion and pity for the poor? And knowing what he did with the merchants at the temple, I don't think he was very fond of the invisible hand of the free market.\" Harrington exclaimed. The reaction was mixed, with some outright booing the President but others laughing a bit. Conservative newspapers fiercely criticized the President for using Jesus to \"push his heretic communist agenda\", but the liberal media celebrated Harrington's witty comments on religion. The President is sure he made a good impression."

A good chunk of the rural farmers of the Rust Belt supported Harrington, so now he has to prove them that he is willing to support his campaign promises. Harrington addressed a group of corn farmers in Iowa to talk about the necessity of investing in the rural industry. He promised that more funding will be invested in subsiding the farms, improving infrastructure and creating new schools across the state. \"Agriculture is one of the main cores of America, so it would an injustice to leave you behind just like that.\" In what was already a recurring trope for Harrington's tour, a voice could be heard from behind the crowd. \"I voted for you and now my crops are fucked, you asshole.\"\n\nThe Secret Service was ready to push the troublemaker out of the crowd when Harrington ordered them to stop. \"Do you want to come here to talk about it? Seriously, I'm interested\" Harrington exclaimed. The farmer eventually arrived to the podium and the President asked what his problem was \"Those rats just fucked my entire harvest and now I don't have a penny. What am I supposed to do?\" Harrington thought about it for a few seconds and eventually delivered an answer. \"Those who have the same problem right now, rise your hands\" At least a third of the people present raised their hands. \"Well, I didn't see the rat infestation coming, but that's not excuse. Not only am I going to invest in better pesticides, but also compensate those farmers that lose their crops. What do you think?\" Harrington exclaimed extending his hand. The farmer smiled and shook Harrington's hand with satisfaction \"That sounds like a pretty good deal!\" The event made a really good impression on the rural regions, guaranteeing a solid support base for future reforms."

His objective is to ensure support for his ambitious program of expansion of funding for small and medium farmers. He managed to pressure some of the Governors of the Rust Belt to help him, but now he needs the support of the most powerful rural and manufacturer businessmen in the country. A reunion was planned in Washington to address the issue, where Harrington had to negotiate with his mortal enemies for hours.\n\nThe fat cats started to talk first. \"With all due respect, Mr President your actions have greatly affected our interests\" a man with a cigar exclaimed. \"Your aggressive rhetoric only alienates our good will to negotiate. My associates and I want to make sure that this deal will be beneficial to us.\" another bald executive said. Harrington immediately fired back. \"Gentlemen, this can end in two ways. We associate in this project, improving your profits and we both benefit from it or we do nothing, the farmers suffer and you lose your chance for a good business. I'm open to negotiation, but I also need your compromise.\" The executives were actually surprised that Harrington was willing to listen to their demands to come to an agreement. Maybe that pesky Socialist is not that dumb after all.\n\nAfter hours of negotiation and deliberating the details, the businessmen accepted moderate support for Harrington's project. \"Well, Mr President my colleagues and I decided to support your project. We are confident that this partnership could benefit both parts. However, we also hope that you will respect our interests the same way we respect yours. Have a nice day.\" Harrington now needs to work on the bills, but after such a long tour through the country and dealing with the bourgeoisie he decided to take a few days to rest first."

This comes as a surprising announcement to the nation, especially Nationalist voters, who voted in strongly against the progressive candidate last November. Byrd himself even said that he would sooner join the Republicans than see Harrington- whom he called a communist- in office.\nNow however, the political situation appears to have shifted in favor of the Progressives, with the Nationalists voting along in their most recent piece of legislation. Not all on the Nationalist caucus appear to have caved, with several Congressmen and politicians continuing to vehemently oppose the current administration. This group notably includes Senator Strom Thurmond, who had this to say: \"I don't know what my party is doing, siding with a godless Bolshevik like our current President. It saddens and angers me, and I will not give in to the tyranny of the majority; I will continue to fight for what's best for America.\"\nRegardless of the outliers, it appears that most of the Nationalist wing is now cooperating with the Harrington Administration, and their voters appear likely to follow suit. How President Harrington was able to garner the support of a faction that has been strongly opposed to him in the past remains unknown, but a deal was likely made; one that may require the breaking of the President's campaign promises."

And everybody will be needed to mobilize voters, antagonize fence-sitting legislators, turn out to protest in favor of the administration, and help construct a coalition that the President can rely on. Some will certainly find it distasteful, but the Harrington administration represents the best chance for radical material gain in the history of the American left.

But others, like the IBEW, UMWA, and SMWIA, all have leadership that is much more suspicious of the President. Many of them have powerful machines that the NPP's political efforts rely upon, which they are loath to give up and which we would regret crossing.\n\nThere are a number of ways we could deal with America's unions, but they pretty much boil down to two major options. On one hand, we could bank on the UAW and other progressive unions to give us more of their support. They're more ideologically aligned with us, and are more reliable, especially in the North, but there may be backlash from moderates elsewhere in the country, which could bode poorly for our future efforts. On the other hand, we could reach out to more moderate unions, and calm their worries about our administration. However, it's unlikely that we have the time or the political capital to address both."

They would be valuable allies, if Harrington could convince them.\n\nCesar Chavez's eyes never looked away from Harrington's. Chavez looked kind and understanding, and he was, but he was weighing and balancing every word the President said. Every now and again, he looked to Dolores Huerta, the master of outreach and organizing, gauging her expression.

Harrington finally put his pen down and offered a small chuckle, saying, \"People, fickle, huh?\" before chuckling a bit more. Yet, as the President took some time for himself, work always seemed to find him as another set of knocks rang against the door of the Oval Office.\n\n\"What's it look like out there on the front lines, Irving?\" Harrington asked, as Vice President Howe stepped forward. Irving offered a smile and a handshake in return \"Well, uh, Michael, another report came in about the defections in the South, a followup from the other day.\" He said, unveiling another set of reports. President Harrington took a while to carefully read through the set of paperwork, and once again, new punches thrown at his optimism came with every page. The numbers were accurate, as bases of his support continued to make moves towards joining the Republicans and the Nationalists of the NPP. A bit of confusion filled him upon seeing a new growth of defections in the Rockies rather than the South. And a bit of shock came as he saw that some had reported their \"tiredness\" bringing them towards the Left of the NPP and the Sovereigns on the other side. \"What... what's going on, Irving?\" the President, sounding a bit beat up, bit still cheery. The Vice President took a few seconds for the President to get his worries out before speaking, saying \"Michael, you and I have worked a long time to get people to sympathize with the Progressive movement. But what's one of the biggest responses we always got whenever we made a speech or published an article?\"\n\nThe President took a few slow breaths before responding, working towards building up his cheeriness once more as he thought of the years that had flown by alongside his best friend, Howe himself. Of the battles fought, and the victories one alongside one another."

 harrington.33.desc:0 "The sinking feeling within the Missourian President's chest continued to rock him with every persistence of his emotional turmoil. The aching feeling shook the man to his core, and yet, Michael Harrington could not bear to turn away from the thoughts plaguing him. Originally, he could offer some understanding towards the citizens' concern for the rapid change, even if it helped them, because hey, change can be difficult. But now, concern has seemingly transformed into daggers launching into the President's back.\n\nHarrington watched onward as news had already predatorized the entire affair revolving around the divisions beginning to form within the NPP all across the country in regards to his cabinet's successes. Finally, the South had begun to slow down the numbers retreating towards the Nationalists: if only because the majority of those willing to defect had already done so by now. And yet, as the President watched onwards, he could only feel icy betrayal as the newscaster pointed to other areas of the United States, pointing towards new, emerging areas of political upheaval. Scenes of protestors gathering in the Rockies to combat his \"aggressiveness\" in changing the political atmosphere, with one group leader proclaiming that \"the President has frustrated the government with his radical attempts to flip the table on them as he continuously butts head with the Congress to try to get these ridiculous proposals out. They're tired, and we are too!\" Every word blended together to deliver a punch to the President's gut, as he watched the black and white television broadcast images of his foundation of support, the Midwest, his own homeland, Missouri, and the Pacific, acting in defiance with small gatherings looking to turn against his actions. Every demonstration, every showcasing of the American people's exhaustion with the conflicts in Washington, every banner, every sign, every action against President Harrington served to cut away at the strings of the President's heart. \"Had he not done what was right?\" the President thought as he saw images of a Yockey rally in Kentucky and a brawl breaking out between Progressive members and some Democrats and Nationalist members in Minneapolis.\n\nWith a few knocks on the door, Vice President Howe entered the Oval Office to deliver news of the broadcast to the President. As he entered, he saw the President standing, wiping his eyes as he watched the news. \"My apologies, Michael, I didn't mean to interrupt you.\""

A simple yet wondrous example towards the brilliance housed within the possibility of the individual workman within the economic system of the country. Workmen which he, the President of the United States, fought day and night for. And yet, as he stared at the newspaper in his hands, he witnessed how these newspaper delivery workers spread the decrying messages of the defiance of his former support.\n\nEverywhere Harrington looked, whether it was the large graphics of maps detailing political shifts, or the articles describing the spiteful protests throughout the nation against the presidential administration, he saw a nation of reluctance, crouched behind an array of heart-piercing defenses, sensitive to even the slightest bit of change, in Harrington's mind. The South had solidified their antagonistic approach to the administration, as the wave of what the critics and opposition call \"exhaustion\" had moved the Rockies to change. Yet even so, the venomous trail continues to seep forward, as the baseless claim of frustration has begun to sprout throughout the Pacific and the Midwest more and more. As the President continued to flip the pages, the bruises to his self conscious continued to ride his mind, causing him to relive the feelings of the television broadcast from so long ago, the feelings of loss, of betrayal. Suddenly, as Harrington walked behind his desk, essentially falling into his desk chair, a rush of more memories flooded his mind once more. This time, not with the icy feelings of the betrayal of his constituents, but of the warm connection he shared with them. Those countless hours he spent meeting up with dozens, if not hundreds of workers across the United States of America, all in desperate need of care and concern that Washington was not willing to provide for the hardworking support of the American government and economy. No, they would prefer to cut the NPP apart, leave the power to the Left who are organizing riots as we speak and the Yockeys who are going to be tearing the constitution apart the second they get close to it.\n\nAs the President brought his palms to his face to try to wipe the anger and frustration from within him, his eyes became fixated on a particular part of one of the articles in the corner of the page. The name of one of the most beautiful cities in the United States, the Gateway to the West, St. Louis, Missouri, engulfed in street brawls between the Nationalists and the Progressives."

It was an honor to serve alongside you and work together for the common man of America, but I must tow the line for the sake of my career. We will see each other soon, President Harrington.\" The phone line cut soon after before Harrington had the chance to respond.\n\nThe President sat leaned over his desk, silent despite his Vice President having been here to listen into the entire conversation. \"So, who was that, Mike?\" Howe asked. \"One of the Senators of New York, another gone from the East Coast.\" He said in near monotone had Irving not caught the strings of emotions tied to the President's anguish. \"Fuck.\" Harrington stated, pushing away from his desk as his face grew redder by the minute. \"What the fuck else was I supposed to do, Howe, what the fuck else?\" The President roused, making Irving more and more uncomfortable as he saw his friend descend into his anger. \"I'm, I'm sorry, Irving. To imagine them being so tired as I sit here steering the course of the nation.\" He said. \"Well, Mr. President, unfortunately, being tired and angry isn't going to solve the departure crisis we're seeing with members of the Progressives, or the growth of the Yockeys across the South.\" Irving responded. \"How bad is the party looking at this point?\" Harrington asked. \"Well, the South is already out of the question, every sympathetic man in the South has turned to the Nationalists, the Democrats, or over to Yockey. The Rockies have slowed their defections, if for the only reason that there isn't any left on our side to switch over to the Republicans. Meanwhile, the very base of support you started out with, New England, the Pacific, and the Midwest are all turning over for the first time.\" Irving said. Harrington got up from his desk to pace around the Oval Office upon hearing the dreaded reports. \"Mike, walking around the damn office isn't going to help stop Gus fucking Hall from taking all our support!\" Irving barked.\n\nHarrington froze upon hearing his Vice President. Gus Hall? The leader of the Marxists, who helped promote and start the protests, riots, and brawls through the city streets?

In particular, Harrington had his eyes glued to the piece of paper that had made its way to his desk. A political cartoon, a source of humor for some active within the divided political world of the United States of America. For others, such as the United States, all he saw was scorn and insults as it depicted a gross misrepresentation of him taking money from blue collar white workers in the South and throwing it into a bonfire adorned with a sign marked \"Welfare Program.\"\n\n\"The daily newspaper in Mississippi seems to have taken a liking to you, Mr. President.\" Howe said. \"What the hell did they do that for? I made these programs for them, Irving, for fucking them!\" Harrington said, tightening the grip in his hands to vent his frustrations. \"Easy, Mr. President. It's because Yockey's taking control across the South, and as the Nationalists lose membership every day, Yockey burns your work across the South.\" Even as Harrington listened on, he had read the reports, he had watched the news, heard the people. Yockey may have been a bastard, that much is true; however, Hall was right on the other end of the spectrum, stealing away from the social democracy Harrington had built around himself to feed to his \"proletarian\" dreams. The NPP, the government, the whole damned country had been engulfed in this wildfire of partisanship and extremism. \"Irving, I have a question.\" Harrington asked, in a tone mixed with resolve yet sorrow, as the Vice President braced himself. \"Did I do all of this? Is it really my fault?\" Harrington asked. Hearing the drastic question from the President, Howe took a long few minutes to think over the question. Howe knew that more than a superior, Harrington was his best friend. Someone who celebrated all their successes with him, and launched their platform into the spotlight. Someone who struggled with all their failures alongside him, and helped Irving get over all the obstacles they came up against.\n\n\"Michael. It doesn't matter whether it's your fault or not. It doesn't matter if it really is your fault, and the federal government has become gridlocked by all the chaos coming from it.

Just as the entire ordeal he had been put through for the past few months had exhausted him, the screams and cries of Americans across the country echoed a similar exhaustion. An exhaustion seemingly grew out of the peaceful change, stable economics, democracy, and logic that Harrington so desperately tried to forward under his Presidency. Rather, all that America could muster to show to the public was the hate inside their heads.\n\nWithin the South, hell had broken out by the name of Francis Parker Yockey. The seemingly compliant Nationalist wing of the NPP dominating the South had been drawn, quartered, and cannibalized by the extremists marching across the streets, advocating for the support of Fascist influence to \"undo the decadence found within the system of government within the Republic,\" as one rally leader proclaimed in Georgia. The bastards marched up and down roads, busy intersections, anywhere and everywhere they could find attention to, and brought havoc wherever they went, forcing the African-American populations of the United States into hiding. Even the madman himself had gone up to stage, with Yockey mounting a podium and advocating that they must \"rescue the ideals of Western Civilization as it decayed with the growing disgust present in the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the North, all who had remained to support Harrington were living in the shadow of a continuously growing name for the Progressives of the United States: Gus Hall. The Communist, seeking to dually overthrow the \"shackles the United States' government binds to the American worker,\" as a news reporter within New York City had stated. Rallies displaying Communist propaganda through the streets of the industrial north brought together the suffering workers that, alongside the unmoving political figures of Washington, hadn't remained loyal to him after working so hard for them. The Progressives of the United States had become dominated by notions of extremism and anger, but even so, wasn't the rest of the country engulfed in the same fire?\n\nEverywhere President Harrington looked, he saw a nightmare of what was meant to be a country of freedoms. Now, radicals occupied the streets as blood, tears, and fire rocked the governmental system, with only the moving forward of time able to tell what lied ahead."

Exhaustion had turned to frustration, and with frustration came action, all until the cycle repeated until one thing was left to unite the spirits of the citizens of the United States of America.\n\nTerror.\n\nAcross the South, hardline Sovereigntists had swelled in number, as they continued to ravage the notions of a free and diverse society within the United States.

As the Nationalists within the National Progressive Pact, the former rivals for Harrington and all of the Progressive caucus, continued to die, a greater enemy seemed to take its place, a monster, no, an abomination. A beast of a man who sought to undo the hundreds of years of American history to raise Hell: Francis Parker Yockey. On the other hand, how could Harrington merely frame his dread around the South when the very supporters who chanted the name \"Harrington\" for the sake of progress now march the streets in a flood of red. The factory workers, the office writers, the hard-working American populace who had toiled for years at the behest of an unfair system attempting to strangle such poor souls out of their earnings, the ones who Harrington thought of and fought for within each and every day of his political career. Now, they cry displeasure and tiredness, and have labeled the President of the United States himself as being a \"traitor to the movement of the working class.\" Gus Hall leads a political atrocity, one which stands to destroy the stability of the United States just as much as any figure harping the word of Yockey would as well, as he continues to tear apart the seams of political and economic foundation in the twisted name of \"revolution.\" Now, America lies paralyzed, engulfed in the tide of destruction.

Improved facilities, more funding for the arts and cultural histories... it escaped nobody's attention that these policies were first laid out in the Brisben proposal.\n\nClearly, the unions are looking for more, but getting them on our side will be easier said than done. It might anger some of the party's conservatives, who have already raised a fuss about where, exactly, the ESEA's funds are going.

Harrington has claimed that \"this Program is the foundation of a new era for American citizens, one in which mothers, fathers, veterans, and children will never have to fear with the looming question of 'Will I go hungry tonight, again?'\"\n\nHaving said that, the Harrington administration has given its full backing behind the President. \"President Harrington has spent countless hours with us examining the bill, it covers everything he wanted to and more, it's genius to say the least.\" Orville Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture, commented. \"We, in the Harrington administration, offer our full support for the President in his desire to pass the bill. We were selected by the President himself to be the finest minds to plan out the success of the poor and the average citizen alike.\" commented Maurine Neuberger, Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nLikewise, the bill does not go without a number of critics in the public sphere as well, as numerous Congressman in the Republican-Democratic Coalition, and even the Nationalist branch of the National Progressive Pact have voiced their concerns and even fears with allowing such meddling in the free market. Backing them up, several large supermarket chains have protested the bill, citing it as a \"tyrannical restriction on our successes.\" Only time will tell how Harrington's bill will fair in the floor of Congress."

Particularly, Orville Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture who worked diligently with the program on other progressive reforms, comments, \"Tonight, Congress will decide the fates of those lowly men, women, and children who lie on the streets, cold at night. Every unfortunate soul, scarred by the horrors of the Second World War, the plagues of economic difficulties, or otherwise, they will know if we, as a society, have learnt to care for such folk, or leave them in the dust as so many Presidents have before.\"\n\nOnce more, however, not everyone is in favor of the President's actions; while some may call them \"progressive,\" Republican-Democratic Congressman, as well as several of Harrinton's constituents in the National Progressive Pact regard them as \"simply radical.\" Even his own administration cites anxieties, as Secretary Neuberger raised several concerns, most likely in regard to the cost of the programs that President Harrington has worked on; however, she declined to comment tonight.

Hearings have been held, with witnesses ranging from doctors to economists to impoverished elders begging for lifesaving care. The FHRA is personal for President Harrington. Many of those elders were people he's met before, in grimy apartments and on ramshackle farmsteads. Success on the FHRA could mean that the lives of millions across the country will improve dramatically.

Nonetheless, they took a hard vote on the FHRA, and they've received plenty of less-than-kind feedback from their constituents. Now, they've come to push the administration to make penance.\n\n\"This contract for Nucor would create two hundred new jobs in Birmingham.\"\n\n\"Spartanburg, sir, is in desperate need of improvements to its hospitals.\"\n\n\"The fact is that more than a third of Florida's fruit producers need this subsidy to continue operations profitably.\"\n\nOn and on they go.

They shared both moral righteousness and an obsession with the particulars of organization. Harrington had turned the White House upside down. Victor had turned the United Auto Workers into a labor empire. And now he had come with a radical new proposal for Medicare.\n\n\"Victor, this would essentially render the private insurers obsolete.\"\n\n\"That's the point, Mr. President. Why should we let anyone fall through the cracks when we have this opportunity?\"\n\n\"It'd be a hell of a lot harder to pass at all, that's why.\"\n\n\"I know it'd be a tough sell.

On the other hand, the US Chamber of Commerce has taken the lead in opposing the bill. They have their own letter-writing campaigns, and much more imposing fundraisers. The Chamber has been calling Medicare the first step on the road to tyranny, a waste of money, a handout, and plenty of other things besides. The sizable tax burden that's been plastered across the editorial pages of half the country's newspapers hasn't helped the administration's case much.

With a cough, however, the man in the middle officially began the meeting.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin this by saying that I am proud of each and every one of you. Without every secretary present, our administration would be nowhere near as successful as it has been.\" A round of silence, with some awkward smiles, greeted the President. \"Having said that, we are nowhere near finishing the work we have planned, in particular being the Social Security network we have planned out to guarantee every American the ability to feel secure about the financial matters of their lives. With that in mind, such provisions are not without costs, and we must address the elephant in the room: the defense budget is easily one of the easiest programs of our expenditure to cut back on.\"\n\nThe President's proposal was met with a wide range of nervous coughs, gasps, and the shaking of heads. \"With all due respect, Mr. President, the nation's security and safety is held up by the defense budget, while we may desire the possibility of helping out those without stability, no one will have any form of stability if we're unsafe.\" Harrington nodded his head slowly, finally uttering, \"Mrs. Neuberger, if you could please, what is taking up the majority of the United States budget?\" All eyes swiftly turned to Maurine as she sat quietly, alone.\n\n\"The defense budget, sir.\""

If we sit on this we are just going to keep losing more support, should we go through with the full increase or not?\" Secretary Neuberger was overwhelmed with the sudden demand of her, but managed to come together. \"Well, Mr. President, I must admit that although it is quite the unpopular strategy, it would generate a substantial amount of income to come in for the Treasury. Furthermore, while I'm no campaign manager, people are sure to appreciate a Social Security net, and if taxes are to provide funds for it, then I would have to say that some would be appreciative at least.\"\n\nHarrington pinched the bridge of his nose to deal with the stress of it all. Neuberger was always one to provide legitimate facts, but he'd be damned to say that this would not come to make his next election a whole new pain in the ass.

The construction of the bill was getting closer and closer to being ready, and yet, with every passing day, more memories of his earlier days flooded towards him. Constant thoughts about his political readings, his viewings of the suffering of those in labor, and the uncaring of their superiors towards their difficulties. No kidding why so many are hungry out there, can't even get a break to eat, can they? Harrington dwelled on his thoughts, and finally sat down after the hour of time he had to battle with himself. Finally, he grabbed the phone, and punched in that ever familiar number. \"Mr. President? It's eight in the evening, can I help you?\" Secretary Neuberger replied over the phone. \"Listen, it's about the Social Security bill. I think I finally want to add in the amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act in it, could you come in?\" Silence came in through the phone for a few moments.\n\nGive me half an hour to get there, Mr. President.\n\nThe President's Secretary came in through the Oval Office just a minute early. \"You don't joke around with time, do you?\" Harrington said. \"Mr. President, I appreciate your humor, but this could completely change the situation. Adding those amendments could cause the business owners to lash out far worse than ever before, and we are already taking in deep crap from them, what makes you think giving them more hell is going to do for us?\" With that, the Secretary's respectful disposition faded to the back, as Harrington thoughtfully nodded. \"Madam Secretary, my senior communications advisors have instructed the danger in it, that the bill is already facing the threat of death without the amendments. But let's face facts, Mrs. Neuberger. Every day, those hard-working Americans that we are trying to look after up here are not getting any respect for the work they do, nor any way to move forward from their suffering.

To see the success of American citizens without a cost to their freedom, time, or effort. He believes in the American Dream, and just knows that it takes a great amount of care and unity to see that we may prosper together.\"\n\nWhile Secretary Neuberger's words indeed spark emotion, the opposition cite a lack of any form of unity in the bill. Many of Harrington's critics, including several Democratic Senators, cite that such a program will bankrupt American reserves, while a wide range of Nationalist Congressmen in the National Progressive Pact see this as a \"direct violation of American economic traditions.\" No one is quite sure as to the chance of success for President Harrington's bill, but emotions are high with everyone present."

It wasn't rocket science - he'd promised America a presidency of the common man, and he would keep his promises. The only question was where to start.\n\n\"What about the veterans?\" Defense Secretary William Winter stated. \"America has thousands of men who served in South Africa and in the Pacific. Nobody's going to object to us treating our heroes right.\"\n\n\"A Home for Heroes.\" Nobody would question the need to repay America's soldiers for their service; the Nationalists of the NPP would be ecstatic, and the RDC would be hard-pressed to say no.

Harrington rubbed his eyes, dry from the strain of reading through the draft. He'd taken a close look at every line - this first act, the one upon which everything else would follow, would be perfect. Senator Jackson would ensure that the rest of the draft would go through Congress, to take care of the rest.\n\nIt ought to be easy, Harrington thought. Everybody loved veterans, and the NPP could finally stick it to the RDC for not only being soft on the fascists, but ungrateful to its soldiers. Education subsidies for veterans, increased access to healthcare, disability payments to the injured - who in their right mind could oppose this?\n\nHarrington sighed.

The RDC members, for that matter, were speaking in broad platitudes about the bill's provisions, hailing the intent of the legislation.\n\nBut the details were a different question. Time and again, Democratic senators - and even a few Republicans - had asked about money. Money, money, always the money. Harrington had been in Washington long enough to understand that when people wanted to criticize you quietly, they would ask about the money - a fitting fig leaf to disguise a lack of concern for America's soldiers in the language of responsibility.\n\nThe debate wound on, and Harrington resisted the urge to call the Senate leadership for an update. Politics was a numbers game, of course, but they'd been careful to package everything in a way that couldn't be opposed on the merits.

A cab driver had found him collapsed a few blocks away from the hospital. A few minutes after we had brought him in and put him up in a bed, he pulled a switchblade and was holding it against my throat. It turns out that he didn't have a cent to his name, and couldn't pay for services. Guess he thought taking a hostage would help his situation somewhat. We let him go, and I never saw John again. The police shrugged it off, when they finally showed up. Just another homeless wino, they said.

But the tension could only be ignored so long - and now it is beginning to splinter the very ground under which the President sits.\n\nAs Harrington's presidency becomes increasingly focused on its internal policymaking, and the cries of Big Government grow ever louder from the street-tops, the NPP is beginning to reconsider its loyalty to the man it has propelled to office. If a candidate refuses to toe to party line, bullying his party-members into submission and pushing an agenda that appears increasingly radical, well.. Loyalty can be defined, but it can also be redefined - created, but also withheld. The Rightists in the NPP led this charge, attempting to negotiate with Harrington to tone down his radical interventionist policy, but to no avail.\n\nIn a series of closed-door meetings the inevitable comes to pass. The Nationalist caucus moves across the proverbial floor, denouncing the Harrington Presidency as a nest of traitors, snakes and vipers dedicated only to turning America decadent, weak and prey for the foreign invaders. They are accompanied, alarmingly, by a pronouncement from a series of Baptist churches in the American South and West, declaring much the same thing: but this time they go further.

His policies are well-intentioned, no doubt - here the author pauses for dramatic effect, evaluating Harrington's personal history and his party's policies in an objective light - but are they really what is best for Americans at this point in time? Harrington's reformist sentiments extend not just to pension funds and social safety nets, but to education, to urban design, to the structure of the job, to a hundred other things that define the American way of life. How much can the apple tree be shaken for its fruits before the trunk tears itself apart in the tension? The author goes on to note that the worrying lack of progress on many of Harrington's Moral Battlefields, his areas of focus where the American poor are concerned, does not reflect a lack of effort on the Administration's part. The bureaucrats of the American government are simply trying to barricade policy they see as alienating and dangerous, not to mention tedious. They might even be right.\n\nThe sympathy the author exudes is possibly the most insulting thing about the article: it is clear that in other circumstances, the author might even have supported Harrington for his conviction and unshakeable belief in the need for a government with a heart. It is with profound sorrow that the author announces his doubt, so profound it acts as a final spit in the metaphorical coffin. He pronounces, with a magisterial and terribly condescending grace, that Harrington is 'the President we deserve, but perhaps not the President the nation needs right now.' Perhaps the editorial would not be so damning, nor its effect so profound, if it were not for the name attached to it: the editorial is written in the unmistakable style of, and signed off by, Lyndon B. Johnson, staunch Republican, cold-eyed reformist and (until today) the biggest ally Harrington has across the aisle policy-wise.

So it is in a quiet room in the locked doors of a hotel a few miles from D.C., as a long-time partnership dissolves - this partnership is not a matrimonial one, but it brings with it its own emotional baggage, and a fear of the future, that would not look out of place in any family court.\n\nThe Republican faction has officially renounced its support for Harrington's policy and by extension his administration: LBJ himself has spoken to the press about the mounting and eventually unbearable tensions the President has wrought on his nation through misguided and hasty policymaking. In a defiant shot back across the aisle, the President has in turn accused Lyndon of being the worst of allies, a moderate too enamoured of the vested interests he hides behind his back to support real change. The answer is clear: a break in public must be followed with a split in the alliance which once held Harrington's Congress together, and helped push through most of his policies.\n\nThe parting of longtime partners is always bitter, and tinged with sorrow: but the uncertainty is far more visceral than either of these. Harrington wonders, as he walks out of that hotel room into the bright day of the Beltway, what lies ahead for the country, and for himself. The ground trembles and quakes, but there is no time to stop. The programme, after all, must be finished - for Harrington has bright dreams for his country still, and the most dangerous visions are those that remain untarnished in the face of failure."

 harrington.205.t:0 "Crack the Heavens, Split the Seas"
 harrington.205.desc:0 "The Centre-NPP has always been an eclectic blend, to use the politically correct terminology. Progressivism is a potent motivator, but its unifying power has always been in doubt, and within the Progressive caucus there have always been strains of divergent thought about the extent and importance of the reforms officially proposed under their platform. Harrington's newfound aggressive stance is one that has shaken significant parts of this unstable base: talking about Social Security and reforms to labor security are quite different from what has been accomplished, what has been done and what remains on the table. There is talk of radicalism, of overreach - the Good Old Days are definitely gone, as are the smiles that accompanied it.\n\nBobby Kennedy sums it up best: in a speech given at Party Headquarters (publicised by media after the event in lurid fonts) he comments on \"the devil we know, and how he turned out to be the devil we don't know so well after all\". The reference doesn't even bother with explicitness, which in itself stands as a testimony to the splits occurring within the Progressive front. It's all out in the open now, and so when Harrington hits back with a demand for party unity and a call to \"stay on course, lest we drift apart and then astray\", no-one is surprised. Acrimony is the order of the day, after all, and just as with any breaking family, it might even be taken as a sign of affection.\n\nOne thing is certain: if things go on like this, well... the President is a strong man and no one can say he is a coward, but he is not a miracle worker. Lapsed Catholicism aside, no Savior will descend on fiery clouds to help him where even his own party has deserted him. Ironic, given the circumstances: Golgotha is far away - but for Michael Harrington, Good Friday is here."

 harrington.206.desc:0 "As ignorant Congressmen clash in a darkling Capitol, the whispers grow to a subtle storm. Crack-crack-crack go the ceiling fans in a dozen meetings, called and cancelled for working groups that have dissolved into the fractal chaos of the Progressive caucus. Crack-crack-crack and the rooms are silent, save for the slow sizzle of burning stares and desperate notes, written in the knowledge they might already be irrelevant. Crack-crack-crack and the President walks into hushed Cabinet meetings where the Pact is mentioned less and less, and Our Men mentioned more and more. Nobody smiles, few greet the President, many outright argue with him. After the anguish there is silence, and the fans, and the silent face of the black night outside.\n\nCrack-crack-crack go the ceiling fans, and with every whir a Party dies. The Rightists are long gone, the Republicans have left, the Progressives have crumbled, the radicals are increasingly silent (although a Representative Yockey and his followers are vocal in their agitation). Slow amputation, but an amputation nonetheless.\n\nThe Republican-Democrats can only watch in awe as their biggest rival for the hearts of the American people calves and splinters from within, unsure whether to mourn or celebrate. The cliques are forming, along lines carefully predetermined by alignment on policy platforms and collaboration: the only thing they can think to agree on is that none of them will ever work with Harrington's Men Of The People (or Yes-Men, to use the derogatory term) again. The Progressives are a caucus in name and in physical presence, but the facade is all there is now. Everything else burns as the President watches a government torn asunder. And there is no end in sight."

Chavez himself has begun to take on an increasingly accommodating position, speaking up for the use of Presidential executive orders where legislative means prove non-viable (and since President Harrington doesn't control Congress, the former is looking like an increasingly appeal long option).\n\nCertainly there are very few cynics left in the Cabinet, and even fewer remain in the President's graces: in what appears to be a reactive fit of paranoia the President has even begun expelling those he seems unfit for the Party and an enemy of his agenda from his personal space (although he really doesn't control much beyond his personal desk anymore). Those who are left are forced to withstand an environment of constant stress and fatigue. Too much work, too few hands, and the cameras and paparazzi grow louder every day, their chorus more insistent.\n\nAfter a 25-hour board meeting titled Resolution To Current Affairs (Legislative Means And Procedures), Harrington reportedly collapses from stress and overwork at a conference reviewing the continuing failures of Education Reform in the Southern States. The press are ushered out, but the photos of the President lying supine on the desk hit a nation's vital signs like a brick. Something is wrong with the United States of America..."

(Last week the papers published a photo of a Guardsman wrestling with a protestor: it was bad optics for all, and if the Zhdanov cocktail in the protestor's hand had been dropped...)\n\nThe hooded figure making his way down the alley gazes at the signs, the paint still drying in bright flecks and stripes: HARRINGTON GET OUT! COMMUNISM NOT WELCOME HERE! WHO PAYS FOR US? The crowds holding it aloft are not bankers or corporate suits, of course. No, these crowds are the middle and lower classes: from the West Coast drawls and the New England polish he hears in the babble, some of them have come quite a long way. He listens attentively, asking questions: here at the end of all things he can at least ask for clarity.\n\nThe poor speak to him as they never have before. Collapsed companies, drying-out towns and burnt-out teachers, slowly slumping local economies. Reforms to education impacting thousands of students, some of them poor, some of them their families' last hopes. Broken homes that only receive a perfunctory brush with federal welfare, and are left to rot. Whispers of the President's inaction towards certain parts of the civil rights movement - is he a bigot? And regret, regret for President Harrington and for the nation he dragged into the furnace of good intentions, endless regret and the scent of lost futures.\n\nAll these come out into the open, and revelation brings its own senseless and ineffable calm.

My position gives power, but it also bestows vision. I see the tired young mother, struggling at her workplace against the invisible sexism that chokes her career and her family; I see the tired old farmer, yoked to the agriculture companies that rob him of his due share. I see the fearful young Negro walking on the city streets, knowing his every breath is a threat to those who would seek his harm. Their struggle to live, work and play is my struggle as well, and I will make it our struggle; for if the other America dies a quiet death just off the television screen, I, your President, will have failed at leading this one. And the struggle that defines these forgotten ones is not just one of poverty, but of culture, soul and spirit; therefore it will be my task, and my privilege, to bring true and lasting reform to the system which shackles with crime, unemployment, despair and low health.

 harrington.303.desc:0 "From the memoirs of Edward Michael Harrington Jr:\n\n...it had come to me, in my scattered thoughts in that busy newspaper hall in New York all those years ago, that my God was quiescent if not outright non-existent. But my faith in the essential worth, the dignity and pride of man, that which is granted to each of us at birth and which the world cannot wrest away save through death - that faith could no more leave me than I could choose to leave my bones and skin. Hence I pursued a singular goal once in office, most peculiar to my peers and aggravating to my opponents; the return to an honest American morality in policymaking, away from the gilded sham it had become in the hands of capital. I began my third speech to Congress with this story:\n\n\"Any child will tell you, and proudly at that, that if one were to see a starving beggar at the side of the road, the right, Christlike, American thing to do would be to help him up, bring him home, treat his wounds. Indeed, if the child were to recommend that we leave him at the roadside to live or die, any parent would rebuke him! The desire to protect the commonweal is ingrained in the nature of man itself. Yet because our country's business halls and public offices deem poverty a sin and helplessness an untreatable illness, we have all become hypocrites! We rob the beggar of his right to healthcare and safety, the mental patient of his right to equal and proper treatment, and the criminal of his right to redemption and restoration to the world.\"\n\nMy question, friends, is this: when your children grow old enough to see you as an equal, to know your accomplishments for what they are, will they call you a hypocrite too? Someone who knew his duty to his fellow man, but spurned it because he was weak, afraid, or simply had too much to lose?...And that terrible title of hypocrite; will you deserve it?"

With his head so far into the clouds, the President hardly heard the knock at the door he should have been expecting. \"Come in,\" he said, snapping out of his trance.\nIn walked an older, slender man with deeply greyed dark hair. Harrington had been expecting Glen H. Taylor, having called him only a few days ago, and now he had finally arrived. \"Mister President,\" he said, sitting down across from Harrington, \"I understand from your call that you're looking for me as a cabinet member?\"\n\"That's right, Taylor. A President needs a cabinet, and I've dallied for too long on the formation of mine. I want you to be my Secretary of State.\"\nTaylor looked taken aback. \"Really? You want me to be your Secretary of State? I just don't know; I was a politician for only a few years back in the '50s, and now I'm just a middling activist and businessman. Why me?\"\n\"During your tenure as a Senator, you put up some of the most fierce opposition to the far right that I've ever seen. You're determined, hardworking, and educated.

Would like anything? Coffee? I've got some freshly brewed.\"\nHe needn't have said anything about the coffee; Harrington could smell the roasted, bitter flavor from just outside the door. He must have made it in anticipation. A thank-you, most likely, for choosing him. She was on to him; he had never said anything about a cabinet position over the phone. \"I'd like a cup, yes,\" he finally said, \"with sugar, but no cream.\"\nShe obliged him, returning with a delightfully sweet but decidedly dark cup of liquid. \"It's very clear to me that you know why I'm here,\" said Harrington.\n\"Indeed,\" she replied, \"so, what position do you want me for?\"\n\"Secretary of the Treasury.\"\nNeuberger raised an eyebrow. \"Treasury? Well, I suppose that is what I would be most qualified for.\"\n\"You're intelligent, respected, and you won't back down a fight with Wall Street or any other business interests because yours don't align with theirs.

It was, for many officers, the safer option: the worst they could expect to face were battles with street gangs, rather than the endless jungle ambushes of the Army.\n\nAnd yet, for the first time in years, the populace was increasingly uncooperative. Wary glances and resentful stares, once reserved for the Army officers, now followed policemen on their daily patrols. More than once, the police would break up another underground political study group, only to be greeted by a jeering public as they corralled the arrested students into the black vans.\n\nAlways, they would find pamphlets, printed with the mark of the Viet Minh. \"Is it not better to die free, than to be an Emperor's slave?\" The Saigon police force had found thousands of them, their numbers rising steadily alongside the wave of crime sweeping the city without pause or respite.\n\nOfficers whispered amongst themselves, sharing worried glances before the next reported incident. If the Viet Minh could spread and win converts in the cities, then the wave of petty crime was only a harbinger for something far worse. Was the war in the provinces finally coming home?"

Knowing this, most attackers refused to allow themselves to be captured, either rushing their enemies with a grenade or eating their last bullet, becoming just another gory detail sanitized as a 'dead insurgent.'\n\nThis guerilla was no different, except he had botched his final act of resistance, shooting himself in the stomach rather than the mouth after being buffeted by an explosion. It wouldn't be long until he expired; the army lieutenant questioning him seemed not to care, slapping the dying man's face to keep him conscious.\n\n\"Where did you get your weapons?\" Slap. \"How many more of you are there?\" Slap. \"Where are your comrades hiding?\" A vacant smile; the lieutenant slammed the butt of his rifle into the insurgent's sternum.

Many of them were released or outright ignored by the Japanese during the war, but in the wake of the Akagi Accords, many of them disappeared, which we thought was due to a purge by the Laurel administration. However, now it seems that dozens of them were warned of the incoming purge and were evacuated by the Luzon-based Hunters ROTC guerilla group to rural Mindanao. On the basis of the former cadets of the Hunters and surviving Army remnants, they formed the Provisional Government of the Army of Mindanao (PGAM). If we can reconnect them with the old exile government in DC, we have a real shot at restoring a legitimate alternative to the collaborationist regime!

He knew every bump, every stop, every turn on the roads that led him to the place where he had celebrated his greatest triumphs and dealt with his most devastating defeats. As the guards gave their familiar salute towards the presidential convoy going into the complex, he remained lost in thought, desperately trying to push away what he had come here to do and instead focus on the memories he had made there before. Like that night Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, after having to move heaven and earth to finally deliver the promises of America to so many, and had fallen asleep beside him open bottle of champagne in hand.\n\nThose feelings of warmth were the only thing that powered him to get out of the car and walk over to the calling flame, but even they couldn't defeat the sense of finality that washed over him as he stopped and finally looked towards where his brother rested. All he could do was simply stare and shiver as the memories of fortitude were replaced by ones involving Jack, long pushed down by both repression and the strains of governance. The ferociousness of Hyannis touch football, the giddiness of him winning the VP nomination, the glow of undying loyalty as his Chief of Staff... He wasn't his charismatic, secure self anymore, and with all his remaining strength he took the note he had held in his clenched fist and laid it down next to the dancing flame. He stared at it, as the feelings of utmost anger, sadness, and loss died down inside of him, before abruptly walking back to the limo. Not a word was uttered by the Secret Service as he grasped onto Ethel, as memories of old faded away and the realization that he had finally made his family's legacy whole set in. After years of fighting, scraping, and clawing, he had secured what his brother had died for, what he had fought for every single day since that horrible moment. Tears poured down his cheeks as the limousine drew away, and he said goodbye to Arlington for the last time.\n\nDusk fell. An elderly groundskeeper shuffled between the rows of headstones, tidying them, making sure they would look perfect to the families who would come through those gates in the morning. Checking on the Eternal Flame, he saw a piece of paper. He picked it up, unfolded it, and pondered the words of a grieving brother's soul finally at peace."

The United States armed forces represent the best of us, standing for freedom and justice in a world so often left wanting for it. We'll have the Pentagon start providing assistance to all sorts of movie and television studios, while simultaneously expanding our direct public relations strategy. America's military might will be known throughout the world in a new way in the 1970s, and if war comes to America, our people will know why we fight."

Everything from satellites to computers to laser-guided munitions will allow our military to achieve incredible things in the field of battle. But to have a more modern, professional, and capable military, we'll need to invest. Officers and specialists will have to be trained. New weapons systems will have to be procured. And all of this will cost quite a bit of money. Fortunately, we were elected with a mandate to expand defense funding. The Pentagon will have all the money it could ask for to build the fighting force of the future."

Thus, it's time to introduce a bill to Congress that will handle two of America's biggest issues: education and military quality. The Army Modernization Program.\n\nWith the program in effect, better education standards will be coupled with improved and intensified training methods for members of the United States Army, and may soon be expanded to include all branches of the military. With hope, we will be able to expand the boosts in education towards all of the American public, for the sake of a better tomorrow. After all, smarter people make better soldiers, right?"

Frost crawled its way across the windows of the Oval Office, as President Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson looked out upon Washington D.C., bearing a warming cup of coffee sat upon the beautifully carved and ancient desk. Surprising? No, for President Jackson had known the chill of frost since his birth as a Washingtonian along the West Coast of the United States. Enlightening? Of course, as Jackson dwelled upon the sources of belief and ideas that had spawned throughout his life, from birth to his swearing upon the Bible.\n\nSure, when you look at the America of today, you can see all the scars of pushing and pulling from partisan politics, of course. But beneath all of that, it was the poor African-American he drove past through the city of Everett, who constantly shivered from frost by any other name, just as frigid. It was the veterans and soldiers he shook hands with, talking about the stories of desperation and the fight for their country they endured as they fought through the Second World War in the Pacific and in England, or, for the younger ones, the plains and savannas of Africa. Hope was what inspired him, as he knew it was possible for this amazing country to be helped even more, no matter how many soldiers or dollars it took. Dollars were what fed the hungry, clothed the naked, cared for the sick, and sheltered the homeless, while soldiers were what stood the wall for America on the frontlines, and made sure the fascists out there didn't take one more goddamn step forward.\n\nA car's lights passing by the wet morning's dew shook the President back to reality, as his hands grasped his mug of coffee, bringing it to his lips. America needed help, to be sure. But its core was golden, and it's time for him to take a stand and ask what he can do for this country. After all, he knew he was the man to do it."

And I know you got that chance, so trust me when I say this: now, more than ever, we gotta fight, General.\"\n\n\"Now presenting the man himself, President Jackson, on the future of helping Americans in his Presidency!\" The Governor of Kentucky said, before shaking hands with the President, as the crowd came to a roar.\n\n\"Good evening, everyone, and thank you for welcoming me to the beautiful countryside of Kentucky! Now, I want you all to know something: in recognizing the greatness of your state and of all Kentuckians within, your state motto comes to mind: 'United We Stand, Divided We Fall.' Now, the very power of the statement calls to mind some of the fights this country has been having within itself; however, I swear upon here and now, that this country is as great as it ever has been, even if it may need your help. That is why I call upon the Bluegrass State's help in moving forward, in helping pick up those who've fallen down on their luck in this country, so that everyone is ready and able to bring about a newer and brighter day for the United States of America! I understand some have raised criticisms and concerns for the cost and whatnot, but mark me, Kentucky: it is our duty, both civil and moral, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your fellow American, and the only way we can guarantee this is by helping those who lay suffering, no matter the cost!\"\n\nThe rest of the night was consumed with a mix of glamor and promises, as far as Vice President McMath was concerned.

The men and women in the room began to laugh as they finished their early morning breakfast, shaking hands with the President.\n\n\"Now, now, let's get to starting this meeting. As I'm sure all of you are aware, the National Progressive Pact gets elections for promises of change, and for promising a better, stronger America, since it needs it now more than ever, with the Japanese and the Germans nipping at our heels. So, we gotta show them what we stand for: everything that gets done in this room, every decision made, every hand shook, every thought that passes through our mind, it all has to back one principle: Evil must, and will, be met with force. There's no room for détente when the people we have to work with have butchered and beheaded the fathers and grandfathers of the families of Americans out there, and there's no way in Hell that I could respect myself for shaking hands with a Nazi or an Imperial. This goes for all of you, by the way. Wohlstetter, you're leading the Department of State, and I want you to make sure that every diplomat, ambassador, and embassy out there knows that we aren't going to be the kid that gets shoved around in the world anymore. Admiral Burke, you're in charge of the Department of Defense, and rest assured, those brave sons of America out there are not going to be forgotten about. We're not going to leave a single Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine uncared for, and in exchange, we're going to be making sure that they hoist the stars and stripes wherever we can. We're not taking one step back, ladies and gentlemen, not at all.\"\n\nWith a few handshakes and nods, everyone went off to work. Jackson knew, in his heart, that America wasn't going to be backing down for the next four years."

Audie looked back, seeing Jodie's face meet the ground, as memories of her crying to him about her father being caught up in an artillery strike near Bloemfontein, and the horror he saw as he saw her dad resting in a hospital, talking to Jodie, missing an arm and having half of his face charred. Audie knew that Roy had it tough at home sometimes, and that all of them had suffered, but Audie realized he decided to make a choice.\n\nAt that moment, he didn't care.\n\nAudie's fist cracked against Roy's nose, sending a splatter of blood and dropping Roy to the ground. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?

 bobby.contelpro.25.desc: "バリー・ゴールドウォーターはワンコールで電話を取り、はじめは手短に済ませようとした。受話器の向こうで、娘の声を聴くまでは。\n\n「パパ、誰かが押し入ろうとしているの」娘ジョアンナの小さく怯えた声を聴くと、彼は机から立ち上がった。「パパがくれた手紙しか私は持ってないのに、こんな酷いこと……」ジョアンナの声はますます小さくなり、すすり泣く声が聞こえた。胸の鼓動が早まる。これはただの強盗ではないのだ。\n\n「愛しいジョアンナ」彼は答える。「お母さんに電話するんだ。それから警察にも。ニュースなんか見てはいけないし、電話にも出てはいけないよ」怒りが沸き上がってきたが、彼にはオフィスで、ただ待っていることしか出来なかった。もっとも、それは長くはなかった。翌日、ワシントン・ポストが盗まれた手紙の一つを公開したのだ。新聞を持つ手は強張り、怒りのあまり青ざめていった。\n\n「保守派の旗手としてよく知られているアリゾナ州選出のバリー・ゴールドウォーター上院議員が、大学在学時に妊娠した娘ジョアンナに対し、違法である中絶の費用を負担していたことが明らかになった。自らの人脈や財産を用いて、バージニア州における手術を手配したものとみられる。ゴールドウォーター上院議員は、家庭内のこととして一切のコメントを拒否している」\n\nこんなことが起きた理由はわかっている。ケネディ政権が自分を中傷し、黙らせ、批判を防ぐため、このような汚いやり口を使ったのだ。屈辱や不名誉を与えるだけで、自分の口を塞ぐには十分だと思っていたのだろう。奴らは何か思い違いをしているようだ。ゴールドウォーターは座り、スピーチの原稿を書き始めた。"

Often these organizations, befitting the ad hoc nature of their creation, tackle single issues with the resources they are apportioned.\n\nPresident Kennedy has seen it fit to form one such commission by executive order. The National Ethics Commission's mission bears a simplicity that masks its significance: to ensure that the government enforces the law to both its letter and spirit. In a just world, the President can trust his subordinates across the country to uphold their oaths; for an especially unjust world, he remarks, the NEC is a necessity in order to protect the march of progress."

 bobby.contelpro.26.desc: "Looking around the Senate chamber, Barry Goldwater felt a brief rush of fear. The speech in his hands was one of the most significant of his career and the wave of emotions since his daughter's call still had not fully passed. His career, his family, his legacy all hung in the balance and he cursed those who had stolen the letters. Rising, speech in hand, he began to speak.\n\n\"Recently, the Washington Post published a story about my daughter. I will not comment on whether the allegations are true or not, as I believe this is a private, personal matter that should never have left the confines of my family. Those who broke into my daughter's home, terrifying her, and stole personal effects should be ashamed of themselves. I hope they will, if caught, be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" His voice had steadied as he continued his speech, the eyes of the nation upon him.\n\n\"I believe in a limited government, properly restrained and limited by our founding documents. I cannot see how the state intervening in private and personal medical decisions is consistent with that ethos. I ask for your privacy and respect as my family grapples with this reminder of a difficult time for us.\" Now, the volcanic rage bubbled up within him as he turned to the last page.\n\n\"I believe this theft and leak were motivated by my opposition to the Kennedy Administration's agenda. If this was an attempt to silence me, then it has failed and I will never stop speaking out on behalf of the people and the Constitution. It should concern every citizen that this President, or his allies, when faced with a tenacious opponent, resorted to dirty tricks rather than open debate.\""
