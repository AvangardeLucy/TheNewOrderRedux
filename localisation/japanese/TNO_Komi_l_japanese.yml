 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_VOZNESENSKY_DESC: "ニコライ・アレクセーエヴィチ・ヴォズネセンスキーはもともと単なるソ連の中級政治家にすぎない存在だったが、その彼が今ではただ一人の民主主義の擁護者となってしまった。それも、旧ソ連の中でもほんの一地域にすぎないこの場所でだ。彼は経済、行政といった分野における高い才能を有しており、西ロシア戦争の前夜にはスタフカからコミASSRの復興を任せられた。彼の活躍はコミの人々の間でも知れ渡った。彼らはヴォズネセンスキーのことを、民衆の幸福を何よりも優先する人としてみなすようになった。\n\n前線と首都の共産主義官僚との闘争の結果、ヴォズネセンスキーは共和国の最高指導者となった。ドグマ化した正統派マルクス主義に幻滅していた彼は、ソ連上層部をコミを破滅に導こうとした張本人とみなしていた。そのため彼は一党独裁制を廃し、間接民主制への移行を行った。すべての人の声を聴くために。\n\nヴォズネセンスキーの懸命な努力により、コミの人々は日々のパンを手にすることができ、それによって彼は多くの人の支持を集めるようになった。しかしそれでも首都の一部の人々は、民主主義を廃すことを考えている。さらに、彼の直面する課題は過激派の存在だけではない。民主主義者の政治家たちも彼にとっての課題となっている。彼らはヴォズネセンスキーの能力を疑っている。ヴォズネセンスキーの行動は彼の立場にふさわしいものとは言えず、さらに彼は社会主義者ともつながっているのだ。だが、彼は戦わずして自らの理想を捨てるような人間ではない。"
 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DESC: "スヴェトラーナ・スターリナは、かつてのソ連中央委員会の一員で、ブハーリンの最大のライバルであった、あのスターリンの娘だ。彼女の父親は大祖国戦争のさなか亡くなったが、彼女はどうにかモスクワ脱出を果たし、ここコミに避難した。スターリンは共産党内の強硬派として悪名高いが、父の教育のせいか、彼女はそれとは真逆の方向に向かっており、今や彼女はコミの上層部の一員となった。上層部のメンバーは彼女こそがコミの政治を安定させられる人物だとみなしていたのだ。\n\n混乱の中で、彼女はコミの最高指導者となった。少々権威主義的な手法を取ってはいるが、彼女にすればそれは安定を取り戻すための一時的な措置であり、すぐにでも民主主義を復活させるということらしい。彼女の主張を疑う者もいるが、それでも彼女の政策は中道寄りで、ほかの勢力に比べればはるかにマシな政治家だとみなされている。"
 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DEM_DESC: "スヴェトラーナ・スターリナについては様々な意見がある。あるものは彼女を西ロシアの良心と呼び、またある者は、急進主義を叩き潰すには手段を選ばない、権威主義者と呼んでいる。\n\nいずれにしても、彼女はその出自からは考えられないほど、成功した政治家だ。彼女の父親はヨシフ・スターリン、ソ連のブハーリン派の官僚だった男だ。公式には彼は工場で事故死したとされているが、その死には今も謎が多い。その後も、彼女は数多くの親族を失った。彼女の母親は大祖国戦争の戦火の中で亡くなった。夫は革命戦線によって処刑された。兄は西ロシア戦争の末期、味方からの銃弾に斃れた。\n\n彼女は、自分は戦火の中で、急進主義の恐怖を知ったと述べ、急進主義との戦いを訴えた。彼女の率いる主権在民民主党は平和と安心を求めるコミの市民たちの熱狂的な支持を集めている。彼女は左派ポピュリストと同じことばで民衆に語りかけているが、だからといってマルクス主義者というわけではない。彼女は「自立、民主主義、そして愛国」というスローガンを掲げ、強力な、独立したロシアを築くことを目指している。そしてそのために、決断力ある外交と、公的福祉の充実、そして軍隊の近代化を行うことを公約した。\n\n愛する祖国を守るため、鉄の女は立ち上がった。民主主義を守るためには、彼女はあらゆる敵との戦いをも厭わないだろう。だが、その敵は、他ならぬ民衆そのものなのかもしれない。"
 POLITICS_ANDREY_ZHDANOV_DESC: "アンドレイ・アレクサンドロヴィチ・ジダーノフ－－この名前は、この人物についてどれだけ知っているかによって、愛と疑惑に包まれる。大祖国戦争前にレニングラード共産党の議長を務めた経験を持つ誇り高き社会主義者であり、西ロシア革命戦線の政府に取り込まれ、ドイツ人に対するロシア文化の統一を促すための有力者として活躍している。\n\nしかし、西ロシア革命戦線は崩壊し、ジダーノフが愛した普遍的な文化プログラムも失われてしまったのである。政府が解散した後もジダーノフは残り、共和国成立前の一連のクーデターや権力闘争の中で、ミハイル・スースロフとの関係を築いていった。共和国の最初は権威主義的な社会主義であったが、最近では、コミ社会主義国家の民主化、マイノリティ文化の発展、中道左派との和解など、より自由主義的な構想を推進している。また、普遍的な文化、科学、イデオロギーをより統合した一般的な教義の制定や、共産党内での科学的管理の研究を優先させること、「革命芸術」の基準を作ることなども支持している。\n\nしかし、彼にはパラノイアが付きまとっているようで、彼の本性は変化していないどころか、水面下で真の力を得るのを待っているのではないかという噂が絶えないのだ。"
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_SUSLOV_DESC: "ミハイル・アンドレーエヴィチ・スースロフは、ヴォルガ川近くの農村に生まれたという謙虚な出自にもかかわらず、祖国で名を馳せた人物である。共産主義青年団からスタートしたスースロフは、すぐにロストフのボリシェヴィキの著名なメンバーとなり、党の地方行政にまで関与するようになった。\n\nドイツ軍が攻めてくると、スースロフはコーカサス地方でゲリラ部隊を指揮することになった。しかし、ドイツ国防軍の到着とともに、彼の姿は見えなくなってしまった。森の中で戦い続けている、守備隊に吊るされたとかいう噂もあったが、アルハンゲリスクの人々にとっては、そんな噂もすぐに嘘だとわかるほど、彼は遠く離れた街に現れた。やがて彼は、若い頃と同じように、西ロシア革命戦線の政治の舞台に立った。そして、西ロシア革命戦線を代表する政治家となり、やがて外務大臣という名誉ある地位を得ることになった。時が経つにつれ、スースロフの影響力はますます大きくなり、次期指導者になるのではないかと言われていた。そんな折、西ロシア戦争が起こった。\n\n西ロシア革命戦線が崩壊すると、スースロフは経済計画家のニコライ・ヴォズネセンスキーとともにスィクティフカルの街に身を置いた。彼らは慎重にコミ共和国を建国したが、お互いに国の将来像が違っていたため、この不穏な協定はすぐに終わりを告げた。スースロフは、赤色民兵のリーダーとしての地位を利用して権力と影響力を獲得し、政治的にも軍事的にも共和国に不可欠な存在となっていた。長い間、操り人形のような存在だったスースロフは、コミ共和国が社会主義国家になったことで、ようやくリーダーシップを発揮し、自分の計画した国の統治を実行できるようになった。"
 POLITICS_BORIS_PONOMARYOV_DESC: "ボリス・ニコラエヴィチ・ポノマリョフは、長い間、コミ共和国の社会主義者の顔となっているが、真のリーダーではない。ブハーリン政権末期のソビエト連邦では、比較的目立たない歴史家、党員だったが、幸運にもドイツ軍の侵攻から逃れることができた。西ロシアで統一戦線が崩壊すると、ポノマリョフは再び快適さを捨てなければならず、彼のような政治的急進派や革命家にとって安全な場所である、新しく設立されたコミ共和国へと向かった。\n\nスィクティフカルでは、栄光の連邦が崩壊する前の、昔のやり方に戻ることを望む、多くの革命支持者たちと接触することができた。ポノマリョフは、そのような夢を見ていたのだが、共和国の左翼に取り込まれていったのである。その中でも特に彼を取り込もうとしていたのが、「操り人形師」ミハイル・スースロフである。スースロフは、ポノマリョフを党内で出世させ、国民議会での地位とある程度の権力を確保することで、今の状況に満足しているポノマリョフの忠誠心を確保しようとしたのである。\n\n社会主義者がついに動き出し、忠実なメンバーの一人が期待通りに書記長の地位に就いた。ポノマリョフは、政府や国民のための強力な顔役として、また、味方が影に隠れるための手段として、操り人形のように影響力を失っている。しかし、彼はそれで満足してしまっている。"
 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DESC: "セルゲイ・ウラジーミロヴィチ・タボリツキーの物語は、彼の性格や政治的見解と同様に変則的である。ロシアの商人とユダヤ人のお針子の間に生まれたタボリツキーは、幼い頃からロシアの君主主義者であり、母から受け継いだ「カインの封印」を取り払おうとする熱心な反ユダヤ主義者であった。ロシア内戦後、ワイマール共和国に亡命した彼は、ロシアの反体制派と知り合い、自分の信念を強め、悪名高い「シオンの議定書」をドイツに広める手助けをした。長年の友人であるピョートル・シャベリスキー＝ボルクとともに、ロシアのカデット派の政治家であったウラジーミル・ドミトリエヴィチ・ナボコフを暗殺し、ロシアの王政を崩壊させた革命の主犯と考えられる人々に復讐しようとした。ドイツでNSDAPが台頭してくると、彼は白人移民の中で最も熱心なナチスへの協力者の一人となり、ドイツの支配がロシアの王政復古への道を開くことを期待した。\n\n他の人たちと同様、タボリツキーもヴャトカでウラジーミルに加わったが、すぐに「偽物の皇帝」と主張する人物に不満を抱くようになった。真のロシア皇帝であるアレクセイ皇子は奇跡的に生き残っており、正統な支配者への忠誠を証明すれば、臣民のもとにやってくると心から信じていた。ヴャトカでは彼の風変わりな信念に共感する人は少なかったが、スィクティフカルでは彼の支持者が現れた。\n\nタボリツキーは、敵にも味方にも動じない人物であったが、彼らを出し抜いて唯一の支配者となり、皇帝アレクセイ2世の摂政としての地位を手に入れた。タボリツキーの妄想が現実になるとは思わないが、彼の支配が猛烈なものになることを疑う人はほとんどいない。彼の熱意は、ボリシェヴィキや、ロシア皇帝を裏切った者に対する長年の憎しみに燃えているからだ。"
 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_BURGSYS_DESC: "ついに仮面が剥がれ落ち、時計の針は進み続ける。かつてパッショナリイ協会のダークホースだったセルゲイ・ウラジーミロヴィチ・タボリツキーは、ついに国家の完全な支配権を手に入れ、その将来計画はこれ以上ないほど不安なものとなっている。\n\n誰が見ても大きな組織に吸収されるべきであったにもかかわらず、彼の「ロシア帝国回復協会」の存在感を確かなものにした弁舌の才を再び発揮し、まさにその回復を宣言したのである。彼は、ボリシェヴィキの処刑を免れたとする皇帝アレクセイ2世の摂政を名乗り、伝統主義や帝国への郷愁を重んじる人々に、日常的に大声で訴えかけ、それを公然と極めて凶暴な反ユダヤ主義と結びつけている。\n\n比較的多くの支持者にとっては、帝国を救うために神がタボリツキーの姿で天から降りてきたかのようだ。他の人々にとっては、彼は絶望的な狂人であり、不安定であり、危険でもある。国家内と彼自身の心の中の両方で反対意見がまとまるにつれ、問題は明らかになった。\n\n時計の針が0時になるまでの時間は？"

 POLITICS_LEV_GUMILEV_DESC: "詩人アンナ・アフマートヴァとニコライ・グミリョフの一人っ子として生まれたレフ・ニコラエヴィチ・グミリョフは、頼りない祖先と異端な学者として、少年時代のほとんどをソ連権力から迫害されて過ごした。亡命してロシア全土を放浪していた時期には、歴史や民族学を徹底的に学び、「あらゆる歴史的民族の盛衰は、パッショナリイ（環境や社会を自分の思い通りに変え、民族の歴史を前進させる少数の人々）によって動かされている」とする「パッショナリイ」の概念を導入した。彼は、自分の発見を単なる学術的な問題に終わらせることなく、ロシアの救いは自分の理論の実用化にあると考え、自分こそがロシアの超民族の情熱性を最大限に発揮させる人物であると思い込んでいた。グミリョフは、ロシアの軍閥に拒絶され、無視されていたが、コミに支持者を見つけたのである。\n\nグミリョフの深い学識、人懐っこい性格、非の打ち所のないカリスマ性は、ウスチ＝スィソリスクの右派のほとんどすべてを彼の旗の下に引き寄せ、一夜にしてロシア・ナショナリズムの家長となった。しかし、グミリョフが熱烈なロシアの愛国者であり、少々風変わりではあるが魅力的なイデオロギーの持ち主であるだけでなく、目的を達成するためには手段を選ばない冷酷な操作者であることを証明すると、右翼過激派はコミの他のあらゆる政治グループを圧倒する力を持つようになった。\n\nグミリョフは紛れもなくウスチ＝スィソリスクの支配者として登場したが、彼の変幻自在で時には日和見主義的な性格のため、彼の最終的な目的は誰も知らない。国粋主義的な支持者にアピールしたいのか、それともユーラシア文明の帝国という自らの夢を追求したいのか、瀕死の西欧世界を崩壊させるためにロシア全体が彼の進撃を待ち構えている。"

 komicoup.1.d: "The relatively calm day in the city of Syktyvkar and the Republic's government was suddenly interrupted, as the supporters of the Left gathered around Suslov, and turned Komi's political landscape upside down by launching a coup.\n\nEarly in the morning, increased activity of leftist paramilitary units was reported, but no one could expect what happened next. Receiving orders from the puppet master of the Left, hundreds of fully equipped and well-trained troops converged on the capital of our Republic, heading for government buildings and the National Assembly itself. They met almost no resistance. Many were arrested, from prominent political opponents to right-wing sympathizers or even normal civilians. In the end, the troops all reached their final destination: the legislative building of the Republic.\n\nAt gunpoint, all members of parliament bar the most loyal Suslovites were swiftly arrested by the military, and the government body, effectively under the control of the putschists, was forced to obey their orders. The Constitution of the Komi Republic has been declared no longer effective, and a new constitution has been hastily drafted, marking the official creation of the Komi Socialist Republic. As for its leader, it is not the puppet master, Suslov himself. Instead, Boris Ponomaryov, well-known as his most trusted ally, has been appointed General Secretary. Suslov himself is merely the Premier of the Republic, preferring to control the new regime from behind the scenes.\n\nWhether the socialist experiment will succeed in Komi remains to be seen, but first, the Suslovite clique that has now seized control will need to properly assert it over the country. Resistance from the center and right will be at a disadvantage, as they now have to become insurgents against the authoritarian government. The next few days will be crucial for the Komi state."

 komicoup.2.d: "The rising shocked the current government, beginning with attacks on police officers and loyal civilians. In Syktyvkar, reports of violence streamed to the city hall all too quickly as gunshots and screams became louder, drawing close. Loyalists met the paramilitaries in the streets and alleys. But they were ambushed, trapped by a hail of fire from the windows above and from the cellars below. And as they battled, so were civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nConfusion increased as units were lost in the depths of the city. Others were directed to the wrong places by their superiors. The battles became too intense and men began to desert. But the Passionariyy pursued them, even to the river, where men attempted to surrender but instead paid for their loyalty with their lives. Bodies floated down the water as pleas rang throughout.\n\nBridges were taken. Important roads were blocked, secured by patrols. The ways leading out of the city were sealed as were those getting in. Attempts were made to break out for reinforcements or for escape, but they were crushed.\n\nSoon enough, it was all over. They swarmed the hall, intimidating the legislature as they were opening today's session with guns and clubs. They arrested those they had on their lists, adding to them anyone who resisted or was thought to have resisted. Shots were common, and the bodies streamed out as did those who lived to be sent away.\n\nWith the old government dissolved, they made haste to see their constitution instituted. Then, it was declared, their triumph made law as a cheerful Gumilyov was sworn in as the leader of this new government. With the legitimization of their overthrow, the Passionariyy were now in control of what once was the Republic."

 komicoup.3.d: "Dawn always brought Syktyvkar each new day of its uncertain future.\n\nIn the early hours, long before the first of those lucky enough to have cars could head to work, convoys of trucks converged into Syktyvkar's streets. Armed troopers secured each bridge over the Vychegda River, disarming surprised garrisons without violence. WRRF soldiers on the far side looked on as one group of soldiers tried to make a stand, only to see its position shelled by mortar fire. Soon after, the trickle of soldiers turned into a flood. The paramilitaries that the extremists had brought to bear were brushed aside by the full force of the armed forces of the Republic under General Petro Grigorenko. The Republican Guard's IFVs had cordoned off the legislative assembly by the second hour of the invasion. No politicians were in the assembly at that time of the day, of course; they were hiding somewhere in Syktyvkar. Not that it mattered, for the streets were now littered with checkpoints. There would be time enough for the extremists to be found.\n\nThe Republican Guards's technical experts swiftly overtook every strong radio station in town. The same message was put on loop, as Grigorenko took to the airwaves, informing citizens that the state of the National Assembly had been an illegal affront to the democratic ideals that every man and woman of Komi should adhere to. The Republic would be restored by a government of national reconstruction, the message informed them, with the Army replacing the extremists in the National Assembly, installing PSD Deputy Svetlana Stalina as President, and granting her emergency powers. Thus equipped, the President, and the military, would be able to quash any extremist threatening the Republic's most cherished ideals of democracy and progress. The Reconstruction Government, the message concluded, would not rest until Komi had stabilized enough to see its constitution restored."

 komicoup.4.d: "Fresh detachments of the Republican Guard arrived in Syktyvkar in trucks, blocking the streets and taking over the bridges. They crossed over the river, quickly asserting control over parts of the city. The paths leading in and out of the capital were sealed, placed under guard by advance patrols. Even the river was taken over, as men on boats prevented anyone from taking to their vessels. From there, they too came to assist their comrades.\n\nThe swiftness of their arrival and of their advances caught the forces of the current government off guard. Police were neutralized. And any response by the city's own garrison was met with a greater one. In no time, they were turned.\n\nSeconds turned to minutes. And now, the whole city was secured. Patrols now raced to capture the city hall, leaving bodies and spent casings in their wake. Without their security forces, the current government was no more. Forced to surrender at gunpoint, officials abandoned their buildings, hands up as they streamed into waiting trucks. Those who resisted were beaten into compliance or shot for ceaseless defiance.\n\nBut at last, they have done it. The restoration of the Republic was accomplished, punctuated by the broad declaration of a state of emergency. Soon enough, the victorious Republican Guard and their supporters made ready to greet their returning President.\n\nFrom the steps of the hall of Syktyvkar, the legitimate government can begin its term. Komi is now in good hands, to be devoted to a proper republic, one freed of what no longer can be relied upon."

However, this world has not been kind to the revolution, and much of the Motherland has abandoned Marx's teachings. However, with the success of our coup, we have taken the first step towards reigniting communism's torch. Through the countless cycles of coups and civil unrest, the revolution has finally been secured, and the Party is now the sole authority left in Syktyvkar. We may breathe easy, knowing that we no longer need to fear the revolution's destruction at the hands of Komi's liberals and rightists.\n\nHowever, the revolution still has many enemies left to face. Western Russia may be home to our ideological allies in Arkhangelsk, but many of our neighbours seek to destroy the revolution once and for all. Tsarists, fascist collaborators, and whatever abomination the Aryan Brotherhood have become, they all wish to see us and our cause dead. We must rebuild. We must equip the people of Komi, and we must go to war. If the rest of Russia will not embrace the revolution, it must be spread by force. The reactionaries cling to a doomed cause, and we shall prove this to them through the strengths of our bonds, and the strength of our arms."

The failing Komi Republic has once and for all been put out of its misery, along with much of its leadership. The communists have been rounded up and purged, as revenge for what their twisted ideology has put our nation through. With no opposition to oppose us, we no longer have to fear the overthrow of our regime. We have much work left to do.\n\nWith communists to our north, an expansionist tsarist pretender to our south, and... whatever is going on in Perm, our regime still has plenty of external threats to deal with. We must prepare our people for war. This means rebuilding industry, equipping our armies, reorganizing our depleted military, and ensuring that our soldiers are willing to die for our cause. Once we are prepared, we shall wage war against all who seek to threaten us. In the end, Western Russia will surely be ours.

So many coups, counter-coups, and such tremendous civil unrest. Our people have suffered, but we shall heal them. While the Constitution may be suspended, the Republic survives, and the leftists and rightists who wished to see it fall have fallen themselves. Stalina has long known the bite of radicalism, and while she has defeated its presence in Komi, her crusade is not over yet.\n\nRadicalism has consumed much of Mother Russia. So much hate, so much suffering, so much destruction. Radicals surround the Republic, and will inevitably seek to destroy it, as radicalism knows only how to destroy. The Republic shall not fall, however. The people of Komi shall arm themselves, they shall rebuild, and they shall prepare to liberate the Motherland from the clutches of extremism. First, all of Western Russia must be liberated, the communists, collaborators, and Nazis have oppressed this land for too long. Then, the Republic shall reclaim Siberia. Then, the Republic shall look to the west, and allow all of Russia to know the sweet taste of freedom. Then, and only then, will Stalina's crusade be complete."

His ideals of \"social democracy\" appear to be solely dedicated to ending the anarchist cause, and decimating Orenburg's proud institutions as a whole. At least, that's what Orenburg says.\n\nWhile most in Syktyvkar have reacted to the newspaper headlines of riots and Zhdanov cocktails being tossed at policemen with a raised eyebrow and sigh, anti-anarchist sentiment is at its peak.

The Guard is so much more than a club, no matter how everyone may see us- we fought against the bandits. The ghosts of the Black Mountain. And now people see us as a glorified police department, heroes from a 'comic book'.\" Andrei spat, as Dimitry turned. \"I didn't know you read those.\"\n\n\"Anything from Syktyvkar is either raunchy, or cluttered with talk about 'symbolism, symbolism, symbolism!'\" He lifted his arms, sighing as Dimitry nodded.\n\nFor minutes, it was quiet once again, besides a small bit of wind, and a peaceful horizon, as the two guardsmen of an older age watched the sun set. \"I have another joke.

Some said he was paraded back to Syktyvkar in chains, only to die on the journey there. Others however, told many stories of how he died, ranging from the mundane to the outlandishly bizarre- but all had one thing in common, and that was his death.\n\nYears passed, and the memory of the Bandit King began to slowly fade as life returned to Orsk, championed by a President who was more than content to help people get over the horrors of the past, and remove the stain of the great terror of the Urals.\n\nIn the end, Oskar Dirlewanger would become a small historical footnote, or on occasion the villain of a story, or tale.

Voznesensky began to read, dreading whatever demands Zhdanov had cooked up this time:\n\n'To my dearest friend Voznesensky,\nViolence between communist and republican paramilitaries has been increasing as the election grows ever closer. I know that you are a very busy man, especially in such important times as these, but I would like to ask you a favor. Gumilyov and the Eurasianists in the Passionariyy are a serious threat to Syktyvkar, and their influence must be curbed. Tell your gangs and paramilitaries to stop going after communists, and instead focus their efforts on Gumilyov's forces. Once I learn of the ceasefire, I will follow suit. This is a very easy decision, comrade, the rightists must be stopped. I trust that you will make the right decision.'\n\nA ceasefire with the communists would give them time to increase the size of their forces, and they could use the extra breathing room to possibly prepare a coup. However, Voznesensky held no love for Gumilyov, and he certainly wouldn't mind seeing his gangs stop openly roaming the streets. Should he agree to the ceasefire? If he refused, Zhdanov would inevitably release his kompromat, and that would be the end for Voznesensky. The President sighed. It seemed that his mind had been made up for him."

They need an example, a leader to show them the virtue of charity. I have gone through the trouble of selecting a suitable organization. I feel that in order to make the message hit closer to home, that the donation should be equivalent to USD $10,000,' that was a lot of money to simply donate out of the blue, Zhdanov was clearly getting more ambitious with his demands, 'I hope you make the right choice. Sincerely, your friend Zhdanov.'\n\nThe charity Zhdanov had selected was owned by a family with personal ties to Svetlana Bukharina. If Voznesensky accepted the demand, he might as well have been paying the Communist Party directly. Of course, Voznesensky wasn't stupid. If he refused, Zhdanov would surely release his kompromat on him. He pulled the checkbook out of a drawer in his desk, but paused as he uncapped his pen. Should he do what was best for himself, or should he do what was best for the Republic? If the information in that kompromat was released, Voznesesnky's career was probably over.

The DSNP is in full damage control mode trying to avoid an impeachment push led by the enraged Passionariyy, while the coalition is reeling. The KPK, on the other hand, have no comment on the matter beyond stating that there is nothing in the leaks proving that the Communist leaders involved, most prominently Andrei Zhdanov, had any knowledge of how the 'gifts' from the President were done illegally.

Now, under a communist government, the Komi Republic has decided to request closer ties with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They seek to reconcile with us over their illegal secession, and engage in peaceful and friendly diplomacy.\n\nOur government is split over what to do regarding this diplomatic request. Some officials call for us to denounce the Komi Republic as illegal splitters who betrayed the front, and instead focus on forcefully integrating them into the Front. Others call for a united Front, and wish to seek warmer relations with Komi, regardless of any past bad blood. A refusal could potentially lead to a future military conflict, but a recognition could show weakness in our government. Regardless, the question is, which clique do we support?"

According to Komi's statements, unification could be achieved as we have common goals. Specifically, our commitment to republicanism has been highlighted, and in general it seems possible for the two governments to co-exist as one, or at least that is what Komi claims.\n\nDespite this, many of our own officials and generals are not so sure about this offer, seeing Komi as a second WRRF, and they do not wish to meddle with communism yet again.

As of today, Vologda is both officially and practically under the control of Syktyvkar.\n\nThe army of the neutral zone has reluctantly declared its allegiance to our cause, although some small problems have occurred by those who do not want to see their lands under communist control. For the most part, the Vologdan government has shown this as the end of the neutrality, not because of force, but because a proper Russian government has been found, and so has managed to gain wide popular support in their move. Even if some are opposed to this, another warlord state has embraced communism."

But it seems that, in the end, they were right. As they wish to maintain their neutrality, Vologda has explicitly refused to surrender to our communist regime. As such, war is our only option.\n\nWe must show no mercy in destroying the anti-communist junta to our west. Lacking the ability to field a large, powerful and well-supplied army, they will not be able to resist effectively, and aside from the insignificant resistance that might linger on led by those who are not loyal, they will be dealt with as a threat within a very short amount of time.

Fortunately for them, cooler heads prevailed, and we can now begin the process of annexing their lands.\n\nWhile also saving our strength - both economically and militarily - for the no doubt many conflicts to come."
 komidiplo.15.a: "They made the right choice. For us, of course."
 komidiplo.16.t: "An Unsuccessful 'Offer'"
 komidiplo.16.d: "The dispatch of the Foreign Ministry to the government in Bashkiria, concerning their submission and integration into the state, has returned. With, as only some in our government and military believed would be the case - owing to the sheer insanity of it - a stern refusal.\n\nIt is known that many senior figures within Bashkiria supported this decision, resolving themselves to oppose submission of any kind, and fight to the bitter end. It is most unfortunate, as now we will need to fight to secure their lands.\n\nWhile victory is inevitable, the damage upon the territory that will be inflicted will take time and resources to fix - which would have been much better spent towards the no doubt many conflicts to come."
 komidiplo.16.a: "They chose... poorly. As they will immediately learn."
 komidiplo.17.t: "Komi Offers Integration"
 komidiplo.17.d: "The socialist state of Komi, believing we have much in common and share common beliefs and ideologies, has decided to peacefully approach us. Messengers from Syktyvkar relayed the offer the Republic has made, and that is the re-integration of Gorky and the army it possesses into their socialist state.\n\nThis offer, while it would end our sovereignty, could prove to be beneficial for us. First of all, we do in fact believe in the revolution as well, and as such Komi's ideology is aligned to our own. Additionally, we expect them to hold the same lust for vengeance as we do for the Germans, and we will continue operating our army within the greater frame of a powerful government that can protect us.\n\nHowever, many still hold reservations about joining Komi. Their reasons vary, from small differences in socialist doctrine, to the simple reluctance to simply give the precious city of Gorky away to someone else. Still, a final decision will have to be made."
 komidiplo.17.a: "Join with our socialist brothers!"
 komidiplo.17.b: "We cannot be annexed by them, reject the offer!"
 komidiplo.18.t: "Gorky Accepts Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.18.d: "This day marks a victory for socialism in West Russia, as Gorky has welcomed Komi's government with open arms. Seeing the similarities we share, and eager to see the motherland strong and reunited under a leftist government to fight the German menace, the military government agreed to unify with us.\n\nA joint military parade was organized in the streets of Gorky, outside of the massive tank factory. Thousands came to see it, and celebrate the unification of the two regimes, further demonstrating the popularity we have in the city. Furthermore, the city's army, well known for its use of armoured fighting vehicles to a great extent, has clearly demonstrated its loyalty to Komi, not only through the parade but through willingly joining with our own Red Army and beginning their integration into the High Command. Thankfully, we did not have to use bloodshed to bring Gorky under our control."
 komidiplo.18.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"
 komidiplo.19.t: "Gorky Refuses Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.19.d: "Unfortunate news come from the frontier, specifically from Gorky. When we gave the government there an offer to unite with us and help in our struggle, we expected that they would understand the situation they are in. A powerful state built on socialism that is not the WRRF they once broke away from has risen in West Russia. Still believing in socialism and its doctrine, aside from their wish for vengeance against the invaders in the form of massive attacks, it would be logical for them to join us. Yet they didn't. They have declared us to be nothing but another breed of revisionists, and refuse to cooperate.\n\nThere is only one solution now, and it is war. As much as we hate to spill blood against fellow socialists, are they truly faithful in our ideology if they do not follow us? Thus, our war plan to invade Gorky shall be executed by the High Command as soon as possible, and they will easily crumble in front of the powerful Red Army we control."
 komidiplo.19.a: "Let's hope we succeed."
 komidiplo.20.t: "Komi Sends a Diplomatic Mission!"
 komidiplo.20.d: "In the chaotic environment our neutral zone resides in, diplomacy is rarely applied. It matters more if you can overpower the enemy's army than if you can convince them with words and promises. In spite of that common piece of wisdom in post-war Russia, the building that Vologda is governed from from received a surprising visitor today.\n\nThe visitor, dressed formally and serious-looking, explained to government officials of his intent, and that was to conduct diplomacy with Vologda on behalf of our eastern neighbors, the Komi Republic. Well known for its political turmoil between different factions forever locked in a power struggle, the Republic seems to have finally looked outwards and reach out for friends. In fact, the ambassador has mentioned specific terms that would be, at least according to him, beneficial for both our nations.\n\nThe Komi Republic has suggested the creation of a proper diplomatic channel between us and Syktyvkar, so that we can quickly discuss issue and reinforce our relationship. Additionally, even the possibility of an actual alliance between us and them has been strongly implied. The question is if we want to accept the offer to strengthen our relationship, or if we want to maintain our neutrality as we have done for so long."
 komidiplo.20.a: "We must accept. Good friends here are rare."
 komidiplo.20.b: "We must refuse. We can go on our own."
 komidiplo.21.t: "Vologda Accepts Our Request!"
 komidiplo.21.d: "Great news come from the city of Vologda, across the frontier! Our diplomatic mission which we recently employed has enjoyed great success. It seems that the regime ruling the town is supportive of our efforts to create bilateral relations, and has welcomed the mission with open arms. Now, we can initiate trade of resources and arms for the benefit of both us and Vologda, as well as discuss our future steps, now that talks with them are not a rare occurrence but a possibility every day.\n\nWe must not forget that the goals of this diplomatic effort do not stop at minor trade deals and vaguely cordial relations. The optimal outcome would be for Komi and Vologda to enter into a full alliance, determined to protect themselves from the surrounding enemies that may appear. They may be socialists, monarchists or fascists, but no matter what the two states will have to band together to fight them off. Of course, if we gain enough diplomatic sway, we could even use this to our advantage in expanding. But for now, our ambassador is doing an excellent work at cooperating with the authorities and gaining their trust."
 komidiplo.21.a: "Just as planned."
 komidiplo.22.t: "Vologda Refuses Us!"
 komidiplo.22.d: "Unfortunately for us, news from the recent diplomatic mission to the western warlord of Vologda are not positive. The mission, despite the offers it made, and the advantages the alliance with the Komi Republic would bring, failed to gather the support of the regime. While we are not certain what exactly made Vologda refuse the offer, and whether it was due to a specific term or their isolationist tendencies, the end result is the same. The possibility of a mutual alliance against aggression and for the prosperity of democracy in Russia has ended with this failure. Let us not be discouraged by this failure, though; there are bigger fish to fry and we have many other options."
 komidiplo.22.a: "Vologda will stand on its own."
 komidiplo.23.t: "A Gift from the Republic"
 komidiplo.23.d: "We received a message from the Komi Republic this morning, something that becomes more frequent as we strengthen our alliance. It was reported that major industrial experts and economists from our eastern neighbor have closely cooperated in order to create a program for financial aid to Vologda, something we greatly appreciate.\n\nThe \"aid pack\", as it has come to be commonly referred to by our officials, includes a substantial amount of funds, dedicated to supporting our economy, as well as boosting developing industries, and even some equipment and blueprints. Komi has trusted us to use this for a good cause, and this has helped our mutual friendship. To truly show our appreciation and respect for this gift, we must reply in kind, sending our own aid to the Republic, in funds as well as investments in their industries. Hopefully this will show them how trustworthy their allies are."
 komidiplo.23.a: "Let's send them our own aid."
 komidiplo.24.t: "Freedom of Movement"
 komidiplo.24.d: "As the bonds between us and the Komi Republic continue to strengthen, the government in Syktyvkar has decided to be even more open to us, both figuratively and literally. Yesterday, our diplomatic office in Komi was informed that the frontier between Vologda and them is now open.\n\nGarrison soldiers, wandering merchants and even normal civilians were surprised to see the unofficial demarcation line become effectively a free border. Once fiercely guarded by military troops, anyone who wanted to cross it would have to go through an extensive search by the guards before going to the other side, not to mention the endless other dangers. But now, many breathe a sigh of relief, from traders to separated families, as travel in the region becomes easier.\n\nBeyond the practicality of this act, this is a show of good faith by the Komi Republic, proving our good relations have beared fruit. Of course, to show our appreciation for this, we will need to loosen our control on the frontier as well, by decreasing our forces on the border and gradually ending the control and surveillance over who crosses it."
 komidiplo.24.a: "Open the borders."
 komidiplo.25.t: "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.25.d: "To the east of us, a Republic has held control for years since the West Russian War. Some time ago, Komi was considered nothing more than a safe haven for radicals, destined to fall on one extreme of the political spectrum and become yet another threat to our survival, as if Germany and the WRRF were not enough. But it seems that, in the end, democracy prevailed. Not only that, but our former rivals in West Russia have been neutralized by this movement. And now, as Komi continues to assert its control over the region, we stand in its way.\n\nHowever, they have not taken the approach of war and conquest, as seems to be common here, but of negotiations. Specifically, seeing Vologda's commitment to democracy, at least to some extent, and our wish to see the motherland reunited under a better regime, Komi proposed we merge our governments. Both administrations will join to become one, and theoretically, it will be an equal unification, not an annexation. Promises have been made that many of those who govern the city of Vologda now will continue to do so in the future, under the protection of a strong democratic government. Additionally, the messages we have received seem to strongly imply that, should we refuse to accept the offer, since we will be considered enemies of democracy and the nation, violent action will have to be taken by Komi against Vologda..."
 komidiplo.25.a: "Clearly, Komi is unable to communicate their true intentions."
 komidiplo.25.b: "Accept the offer, for a democratic Russia!"
 komidiplo.26.t: "Vologda Declines!"
 komidiplo.26.d: "Unbelievably enough, the neutral zone of Vologda has refused to bow down to our authority! In a move of treason against the nation, and defying the wishes of the people for the rule of a strong and democratic government, the military junta governing the city to our west flat out declined the offer for merging the two regimes, stating that they wish to continue enjoying their freedom and their rights as a neutral zone that will not acknowledge any warlord's authority.\n\nWe have already begun our preparations for what is now inevitable, an armed expedition into Vologda. The diplomats have departed the city and returned to Syktyvkar, ending all communications with the neutral zone. Meanwhile, the High Command is finalizing the details of Plan Blue, the codename for the invasion. It will not take long before we are ready for war against the weak regime to our west."
 komidiplo.26.a: "This is what happens to traitors."
 komidiplo.27.t: "Vologda Votes to Join Komi!"
 komidiplo.27.d: "Celebrate, citizens of Komi! Today, Vologda joins our Republic!\n\nThe offer for merging the administrations has been welcomed by the semi-authoritarian government in Vologda. It seems they still believe in democracy, and as such they quickly answered our request with a positive response. Quickly, the two militaries ended all limitations to travel between their respective territory, and are working to tear down any border fences or checkpoints. The soldiers near the border have come together, celebrating the unification and meeting their Russian brothers that are no longer enemies on the other side.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from the military regime we have recently united with have arrived in Syktyvkar, outlining the exact plans and process for the proper integration of their lands into the Republic. In the streets of both our own capital and Vologda, the citizens cheer on our government, and the flag of our nation is waved proudly across our domain."
 komidiplo.27.a: "This is truly a day of joy."
 komidiplo.28.t: "Komi Promises Autonomy within the Republic"
 komidiplo.28.d: "We have received a curious message today. Diplomats from the so-called Komi Republic, which now borders our free state, have sent us an offer that is not to be taken lightly. They are requesting that Tatarstan join with them as an autonomous Tatar republic. Should we accept their offer, we will retain a good deal of our autonomy and will no doubt be granted a say in their government. However, our days as an independent and sovereign nation will officially be over. If we deny their request, on the other hand, there is no telling how they will react. They may opt for a more direct approach to our annexation..."
 komidiplo.28.a: "Our independence is not up for debate!"
 komidiplo.28.b: "It is for the best that we join them."
 komidiplo.29.t: "Tatarstan Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.29.d: "Bad news from our diplomats in Tatarstan. Their arrogant government has outright refused our well-intentioned annexation proposal, and have strongly insisted upon their status as an independent state! Now that we have no other option to settle this matter peacefully, it may be time to activate Plan Violet after all. Forces are to be mobilized to their borders and begin preparing for offensive operations at once. Although the Tatars are known for their ferocity in battle, they are hopelessly outgunned and cannot hold out against our forces for long. Once the dust has settled, a period of occupation will begin to ensure the annexation process goes smoothly."
 komidiplo.29.a: "We were hoping it wouldn't come to this."
 komidiplo.30.t: "Tatarstan Agrees to Annexation!"
 komidiplo.30.d: "Good news from our diplomats in Tatarstan! The Tatars have agreed to our generous offer of annexation, and have reached out to us to formalize their integration into our Republic. Their little nation, including their politicians and armed forces, are expected to join the fold shortly. An autonomous Tatar republic will soon be established within our borders, but most importantly we have managed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed despite these turbulent times."
 komidiplo.30.a: "Diplomacy has won the day!"
 komidiplo.31.t: "Komi Promises Autonomy within the Republic"
 komidiplo.31.d: "Ever since the forces of the Komi Republic had arrived at our borders, it was only a matter of time before they would attempt diplomatic overtures. That day has finally arrived, and diplomats representing Komi come bearing an offer that we would do well to consider. They are offering us a great deal of autonomy under their protection, as well as a place in their democratic political systems. Most importantly, however, is that they are guaranteeing full religious freedom for the people of Bashkiria.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a generous offer, but is it worth giving up our hard-won independence for? If we were to decline, it is possible that further offers will be considerably less generous, and made from the barrel of a gun...\n\nWhat will our answer be?"
 komidiplo.31.a: "Their proposal is generous, we will accept."
 komidiplo.32.t: "Bashkiria Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.32.d: "Troubling news from Bashkiria. It seems our diplomats have come home empty-handed, and the Bashkirs have reaffirmed their wishes to remain an independent islamic republic. Despite making a generous offer in good faith, it seems as though it was not enough to satisfy the fiercely zealous Bashkirs. We have no choice but to fall back to Plan Yellow.\n\nThis simple, robust strategy emphasizes eliminating any hostile Bashkir forces as quickly as possible, and includes plans for a temporary occupation government once offensive actions have ceased. Their army, although zealous and well-motivated, is outclassed by a considerable margin and the invasion is not expected to last very long."
 komidiplo.32.a: "They leave us no choice."
 komidiplo.33.t: "Bashkiria Agrees to Annexation!"
 komidiplo.33.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Bashkiria, and they bring with them promising news! The Bashkirs have agreed to our terms and now wish to discuss the finer details of their integration. This process is not expected to take long, and soon they will be integrated into our nation as an autonomous Bashkir republic with full religious rights guaranteed. On top of all this, their citizens will be given an equal say in our democratic processes. With this agreement in place, we have successfully expanded our influence into this region without firing a shot."
 komidiplo.33.a: "The pen is mightier than the sword."
 komidiplo.34.t: "An Anti-Bolshevik Pact?"
 komidiplo.34.d: "Ever since the West Russian War ended in a humiliating defeat for the cowardly forces of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, a specific status quo was established in the region, one that most soon came familiar with. Of course, there have been times where it has been shaken up, but for the most part, it has remained the same. For us, a pocket of Tsarism surrounded by potential enemies on all sides, it is crucial to use this state of things to our advantage, and the political developments in the Komi Republic have certainly helped with that.\n\nEver since the domination of the right-wing, nationalist forces in Syktyvkar, the diplomatic office of Vyatka has wondered if something could be done to make use of this political group in power. However, it now seems that they have decided to make the first move. We have just received a telegram from the Republic to the north, in which they ask regarding the prospects of a mutual alliance against our common enemy, the WRRF.\n\nOur diplomats have quickly analyzed the situation that such an agreement could bring to West Russia. Of course, the nationalists of Komi are ideologically aligned, for the most part, to us, and could provide a shield against the strong communist forces threatening us from the north. Effectively, they could become our buffer state. In the end, what will our response be? Will we accept this proposal for a pact against our ideological enemies, or abandon the people who still do not bow under the Tsar's authority?"
 komidiplo.34.a: "Together, we are stronger."
 komidiplo.34.b: "Our road is ours to tread."
 komidiplo.35.t: "ヴャトカは協力に同意する"
 komidiplo.35.d: "今日、反ボリシェヴィズム勢力は自由ロシアにおける赤の最後の残党さえも打ち破るための大きな一歩を踏み出した。我々のイデオロギー的な目標に曖昧に沿ったメッセージを軍閥国家ヴャトカに送ったところ、前向きな返事が返ってきた。我々が、彼らのこの地域で生き残って繁栄するための数少ない希望であることを理解したようで、彼らはすぐに相互援助条約に同意することを表明してくれた。\n\n返事を受け取った瞬間から、驚くほど急速に物事が進展している。我が共和国とヴャトカの外務大臣が接触し、現在正式に同盟を締結するための会議の日程を調整しているところだ。しかしこの手の裏外交ではよくあることだが、同盟の内容の多くはすでに水面下で話し合われている。\n\n協定には、一方の国が攻撃された場合、他方は条約により同盟国を助けるという約束が盛り込まれる予定だ。顧問や連絡官という形の限定的な軍事的プレゼンスを提供することも、おそらく文言に盛り込まれるであろう。最後に、二国間の大規模な経済的または軍事的協力も含まれる可能性が高い。今後ヴャトカは我々の偉大な同盟国として、我々の側に力強く加わってくれるだろう。"
 komidiplo.35.a: "最終的に友人を得られることを我々は楽しみにしている。"
 komidiplo.36.t: "ヴャトカは我々の申し出を拒絶する"
 komidiplo.36.d: "我々と南の君主主義者の同盟の可能性を検討する電報がヴャトカに送られたとき、我々はウラジーミル皇帝が我々の共通点と、多数の敵に対する我々の状況がいかに悲惨であるかを理解しているものと期待していた。しかし、あちらの外務省が急遽送ってきた返信から察するに、我々の思想の微細な違いは、彼らが同盟の申し出を拒否するか、少なくとも拒否することを正当化するのに十分だったようだ？\n\nもちろん、我々の信条はロシアの国家と国民の偉大さに留まっており、そして彼らの信条は共産主義者やドイツ人、その他すべての敵に対抗する意志にとどまっていた。エリートの中のエリートだけに媚びへつらってあらゆる階層の人々の真の意思を無視した君主制の理想に盲従しないことを我々は選んだ。右翼のごく一部の人たちはそれに懐疑的であるものの、おそらく我々がそうしたことが絶対的に正しかったようだ。\n\n特にWRRFが不吉に迫ってきているこのときに、ウスチ＝スィソリスクとヴャトカの間で通じていたあらゆる外交チャンネルや裏口は、外交的裏切り行為と受け取った余波により閉ざされてしまった。あらゆる観点から見て、ツァーリ派との友好の望みはすべて絶たれた。今後、我々が再び行う唯一の外交的交流は、我々と彼らの間に戦争が不可避になった際に、彼らが降伏する時になるであろう。"

 komidiplo.55.d: "The theorists of the Komi Republic are its most solid fixture. For every ideological belief with traction, it seems there are a half-dozen men and women struggling to explain away the contradictions and analytical diversity of their chosen bloody hill of ideology. In fact, the sheer factionalism of every missive that comes out of the Republic is one of the reasons for the WRRF's hesitance in initiating official diplomatic ties in the wake of the Socialist change in leadership. It would simply be bad praxis to disrupt a situation that can charitably be described as, ah, dynamic.\n\nWhich is why it comes as a surprise to the men and women gathered in the United Front's Arkhangelsk Central Party Headquarters when the letter from Komi comes co-signed by half the factions in its Communist Party. It appears the cats have herded themselves, as a General dryly comments, into the fold.\n\nThe letter proposes, in a burst of rhetoric that is so ideologically packed it is unreadable in portions, a merger of interests. The Revolutionary Front has dedicated itself to military protection of the Socialist ideal. The Republic has spent much time and energy on developing the theoretical depth of Russian Socialism. A merger of the two, with the Komi Republic leading administrative affairs and the Arkhangelsk government transitioning to a proper military role, would surely be preferable to the mutual vulnerability of an arms' length relationship.\n\nIt is a tempting offer, but there is one major flaw to the plan that the letter has not spelled out: the Arkhangelsk government is not particularly trusting of the functionaries of a Republic that has never known the struggles of the North. Only the realisation that this alliance could give the Red Army an inroad into the South and West gives the proposal leeway in the debate - and even then, it is a matter of balanced odds, not inevitability."

 komidiplo.56.t: "The WRRF Refuses!"
 komidiplo.56.d: "Excerpt from \"On Deviationism: A Response to the West Russian Pseudo-Revolutionaries\", Special Publication of the Komi ASSR\n\nIt is with deep disappointment, but no real surprise, that we discover the true nature of the so-called Arkhangelsk Socialists - or, as we now know them, the Arkhangelsk Junta. We had, all of us, nursed doubts as to the ideological consistency of men whose guns seemed so often to outweigh their convictions. Why did the Revolutionary Frontists choose to give their senior generals, with unclear connections to their Politburo, fiefdoms that were autonomous from their main territory? How could the Revolutionary Front's civilian policy not consider the role of autonomous Communist Party organs in developing ideological devotion in the local Proletariat?\n\nWe now know that the Clique - those red-painted jackals in waiting! - were not conflicted over their bizarre attempts at imposing socialism at gunpoint. In all truthfulness, this author doubts if the Revolutionary Front was ever truly committed to socialism at all, other than as a way to further the cause of their bourgeois crypto-nationalism. All illusions must henceforth be dispelled, all hopes released, all expectations destroyed. The truth is that Arkhangelsk, far from being our salvation, has turned out to be yet another rightist, deviationist gang of armed men devoted only to perverting the Revolution into their twisted, violent image.\n\nIf there is anything to be learnt from this state of affairs, it is our renewed understanding that only a commitment to the Party Line can ensure true loyalty to the Revolution. Just think! Had it not been for the Party of the Republic, we would have been as prone as any other people in Russia to the disease that is warlordism. We thank Arkhangelsk for this, and only this - because of their stubbornness, we have been inoculated from this disease once and for all."

We look to the World with expectant eyes, and to the rest of our Motherland - if the generals of the Front hope to find in us the ideological strength and the collective will to undo the Undoing of the Nation, they can rest assured that they will find us more than sufficient.\n\nWe must not rest on our laurels, however. The time has come to use the massive armaments Arkhangelsk has gathered - the warlords around our scattered domains are restless. They see the march of history in their eyes. The time is coming when they will attempt to stop it.\n\nWe must simply beat them to the punch. Let us not be afraid of the future, comrades. The triumph was long delayed, but it, like the World Revolution, like the spinning of the world itself, will come one day. Only our resolve is required, that on that day we might stand in the hallowed ranks of the Martyrs and say:\n\nI was there when History needed me."

 komi_dem_generic.1.t: "The Route March"
 komi_dem_generic.1.d: "Kirov nodded to the officer. \"My squad is ready for the march, Officer. We are preparing to move the first five kilometers, on your go.\" Beside him the squad rustled in its frantic activity: water canteens needed filling, loaded bags checking, rifles inspecting. There were barely enough hands on deck to accomplish it all.\n\nAs the officer lumbered away, Kirov whispered, \"Shitbag.\" What an insufferable son of a whore! And scheduling this goddamn idiotic march on a Friday fucking evening, of all things! Did the Colonel have his brain installed where the arsehole was meant to be?\n\nGod, it was intolerable - and the only reason why he put up with it all was because the Republican Army was still the finest pension-fund in all of the Republic. Kirov was a man of faith - he had faith only in what men could bring him, that was. And having looked through the pension plans, he knew exactly what the next few decades would bring him, assuming he lived through it all.\n\nWell, time to stop speculating on the future: the present, and his squad, awaited him. He moved towards his squad. \"Are you lot ready to go? Get your thumbs out of your asses, gentlemen. It's time to start hauling ass, and if you lot have taught me anything it's that men without brains can get very, very far in life. It's time to start putting that theory to practice.\"\n\nA chuckle escaped the squad, and Kirov's gaze shot to its source. Glaring at the conscript, Kirov let the coldness of the evening into his voice. \"Did you think that was funny, Private? Don't give me an answer. You'll have time to think about it on guard duty tomorrow. Double shifts.\" He turned to the rest of the squad. \"Get ready to move. One mike. And anyone else who thinks themselves a clown can let me know. I still have a roster to fill.\""

 komi_dem_generic.2.d: "It was, like every other evening at the Foreign Strategy Office, both way too long and ridiculously short for their work. Another exercise was planned the following week, and the Commanding Officer had put everyone on standby for emergency planning duty. Officer Nabatov had been on emergency duty the last twenty-four hours in a row, and the map wasn't just swimming in front of him - it was doing victory laps in his eyes.\n\nShaking his head, he took another swing of the jealously-hoarded coffee ration and looked again at his prooftexts. He had to make the maps fit together, damnit, and in their proper order - there had to be some applicability of the Manual of Foreign Operational Doctrine here. What if he were to transpose that West Russian counteroffensive onto the local terrain? Specifically, the one that led through the north Urals like so - and so -\n\nThe terrain maps proved his undoing. The planned advance of the armored column would move through a valley they couldn't recon, and it was the only chokepoint for miles. No, the strategy employed by the Armored Corps wouldn't work unless they wanted to rapidly turn their finest armor into smoking junk. Nabatov sighed. How on earth could he make this offensive work in the five hours he had left?\n\nHe barely noticed the Commanding Officer approach, but he did smell the pungent cigarette fumes on his breath. \"Trouble planning this? Here, try this reference - American work, British defense. Good for the terrain, armor strength parity might need a little rework though.\" And the CO was gone as Nabatov's eyes widened behind him.\n\nYes, he thought as he flicked through the manual. This would work. This would work! His legs turning to jelly from the exultance and stress, Nabatov scribbled a few hasty notes and rose to find the Strategic Briefing Notes. And then, for the first time in two days, he could sleep."

 komi_dem_generic.3.d: "\"For the last time, Officer! I am not handing over the strategy of this country to a Council that thinks that the Army can be relegated to a secondary priority!\" The thud of a binder punctuated the last words, and Strelkov flinched. At least the Commander hadn't aimed for his head this time. \"If the Council truly believes that this newfangled strategy is what is best, I think it best that we safeguard the real power far away from them until they are disabused of the notion.\"\n\nStrelkov nodded helplessly. \"Commander Grigorenko! Please, this is not a usurpation or anything of the sort. We are simply attempting to better strategy now that our Air Force is in working condition. After all, we in the Republic cannot afford casualties the same way large countries can - \"\n\nAnother binder-thud, this one louder than the first. \"You are delusional if you think that the air-land strategy will safeguard our losses! Strelkov, I have been working for close to a decade in the Military, and our entire operational doctrine has been configured to work with combined armor-infantry operations. The Air Force will only complicate this state of affairs by stealing resources and money from us.\"\n\nStrelkov kneaded his temples. \"Commander, there is to be no stealing - we will allocate funds as we deem fit for the health of the Republic. Moreover, we are aware that the transition to air-land battle will take quite awhile, which is why we need you on board. Who else could train with us?\"\n\nGrigorenko simply shook his head. \"Tell your Council that they have two options: they can stick with my suggestions, or they can stumble around in the dark by themselves. I will not stand for this strategic blunder, and I could not live with myself if I were to further it. Now go.\""

 komi_dem_generic.4.d: "There hadn't been a fistfight in the General Headquarters for quite awhile now, and so Korolkov was taken by surprise when the latest iteration broke out. It had been sudden, too - one minute there was a reasonable discussion regarding prioritization of funding to be given to the Military Research Department, the next a full-on fistfight had been in progress, with men in middle age on both sides struggling to either restrain or deck their peers.\n\nKorolkov sighed. Another day in the Ministry of Defense and its assembled glories. Well, glories was a strong term, but he lacked another word for it.\n\nAt least this paperwork would be of use to the Republic - a paper drafted by one of his staffers on the movement of hybridized troops in the last days of the West Russian War, and a note on how to make it applicable to the Republic's current situation. Poring through its conclusions, Korolkov nodded, making notes in the margins. There was plenty of work to be done to bring the military up to parity with its contemporaries, and this would definitely help.\n\nA stubble-headed member of the General Staff approached him, and Korolkov got up to show the formalities. \"Stand down. I'm looking for a paperback, something to fill the gap on someone's chair. Hmm, have you seen any spare binders? Preferably something slim? Ah, this will do,\" and the paperwork was snatched from Korolkov's desk.\n\nThe General Staff member retreated, and Korolkov kneaded his temples in frustration. This was his third day of promotion, and already he missed nothing more than the lowly status of his previous position. The Republic, he was certain, was doomed regardless; but at least he had been blind to it beforehand."

 komi_dem_generic.5.t: "The Fisherman's Dream"
 komi_dem_generic.5.d: "Yefimova's father had whispered dreams to her when she was a child: dreams of a shining fleet of ships, flying the Red Ensign in unison. Each ship, he had told her, was far bigger than the fishing junk they shared: they had guns, ammunition stores, quarters for dozens of people on each ship, and the burnished steel shone like gold in the sun's rays, like some forgotten treasure brought to light.\n\nOf course, that had been a long time ago, he had whispered, and now the Republic they were in was landlocked, and the dream, for now, was dead. But one day the Great Fleet would rise again, and Russia would once again take to the seas: perhaps not in her lifetime, but one day...\n\nYefimova listened as the cold winds drifted about their junk, and as she grew, she learned. She taught herself knotting, sailing, drifting, using only the stars and the harsh Northern spirit for navigation, and as she grew in wisdom her fishing fleet expanded from one to a half-dozen. She had grown powerful, but when the Republican Navy had sent its letter of invitation, she knew what she had to do. A vision, after all, was worthless if not fulfilled.\n\nShe wished her father could see her now, standing upon the deck of the Republic's latest vessel. He'd always been foolish, and perhaps a little too attached to the drink at the end, but he'd never wavered, and her dreams were his dreams, too.\n\nAnd watching the flag fly above a silver-sheened ocean, gulls flying overhead as the engine whirred, Yefimova felt something in her heart glow. Her father, wherever he was, could rest now. His dream was here, in the flesh, and she was living it for him."

 komi_dem_generic.6.d: "Korenev hefted the gun's stock ahead of him. There it was! The defect he'd been warned about was clear as day now: it bent just a little forward, forcing the shooter's position down by a hair's breadth. Perhaps it was acceptable in Zlatoust, where standards were as low as the Altai Basin's dunes, but not here. He lowered the gun and began to pore over the blueprints scattered around him in a half-blossom.\n\nPerhaps it had been the material, or perhaps there was a structural cause in sight. The latter would explain why the soldiers on the Testing Squad had complained so bitterly about the loading and unloading drills. Something about the barrel, then - but their reports had focused on the firing-pin mechanism itself, so it couldn't possibly be that. Maybe in the way the barrel interacted with the firing pin? Yes, perhaps the explosion of the shot had cracked something within.\n\nA passing soldier yelled, \"Korenev! Hard at work? It's almost lunch!\" Koronev, barely looking up, greeted him and told him, in no uncertain terms, to go away. The soldier giggled as he left: it was adorable, the way Korenev was so immersed in his work he was blind to everything else. Absolutely adorable.\n\nKorenev's mind was far away, however: the rifle, as did all the equipment he'd been given, preoccupied him. Some solution needed to be found in the meantime. The barrel problem would probably need a full rework of the design, perhaps even a back to basics test. But the main problem, as he saw it, was the drooping. Perhaps - yes - that would have to do.\n\nKorenev scribbled: PUT SOME EXTRA STOCK ON THE RIFLE AND TELL THEM TO AIM HIGHER. Satisfied, he nodded and went on to the next rifle."

 komi_dem_generic.7.d: "It was, in the end, the budget that decided it for them all, not tactics, not armor specifications, not even the opinions of the tank-crews themselves. The budget simply didn't have enough room for the additions of tank units to the regiments of the existing armor corps. It would be necessary to reconsolidate their existing assets into a single unit, and retrain them day and night until they could perform the roles they'd missed.\n\nSo the People's Hussar Division, as it was known (no one could remember the actual number and reference), was formed, and the farmers and their sons and daughters watched the tanks move row on row into distant fields, towards the base where they were to be christened in a new name and mould.\n\nThere were failures, as there always were: a few of the new models, fresh from the factory, had broken down in a muddy field, and no one was yet sure if it was equipment failure or a planning error that had brought them down. The rest of the models were dragged onto the main road and confined to purely motorized activity until something could be done with them - time would tell if they needed a rebuild or if they could serve a supplementary function in the Motorized Corps.\n\nEven so, as the base commanders noted the plates and licenses of the tanks arrayed, there was reason for celebration. This new division already had plans in the works for a full-blown multi-branch exercise, and some whispered that its commanding officer was a glory hound who would push his men to the limit. There was a sense of general anticipation - this one, it was believed, would go far, and it would take the Republic with it."

 komi_dem_generic.8.d: "\"God, this place is far,\" Sokalov grumbled as he checked the timing for the truck. His rusty old wristwatch had been a gift from Dad, but there was no sign of his father's precision now as he watched the dusty road. It had been, if this little contraption was accurate, almost half an hour since the scheduled delivery to the Military Academy. How the hell was he supposed to get there on time?\n\n\"Yes, far indeed. I've been waiting forty-five minutes myself.\" There was a twinkle in the other man's eye. Sokalov sized him up, suspicious as a miner's son in a poor district could be of someone who looked suspiciously bourgeois. Dressed in relatively well-tailored clothing, with a little cap to stave off the wind - this man looked nothing like what he'd been told to encounter. \"I don't believe we've met. I'm Semyon. You?\"\n\nSokalov glared at the hand, then relented and shook. \"I'm Sokalov. South of Syktyvkar. You with the Academy?\" Semyon - if that was his real name - nodded, his smile firm on his face. \"Well then, I suppose we'll get acquainted eventually. What's your designated specialisation?\" The man rustled about in his breastpocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. \"Ah, I'm assigned to Artillery and Fire Control. You're Infantry Standards, I take it? I know they're taking a lot of them these days, and you seem the type.\"\n\nSokalov nodded, chuckling a little. \"Can't believe they sent me to Vyatka after sending me into the roughbodies - think the Army wants to kill me, between the both of us.\" Semyon chuckled back, and the air between them grew easy. \"Why did you sign up? This course ain't gonna be easy for none of us.\"\n\nThe man seemed almost shy. \"The same reason as you. I love my country.\" He waved to the fields around them, boundless as the sky itself. \"And I want to keep it free.\" Sokalov nodded.

WELCOME, BROTHERS FROM RUSSIA is plastered virtually everywhere in the airport, and the questions seem to be fired in volleys for maximal damage. It's all the bodyguards can do to keep him safe from the chaos.\n\nIt gets a little better when the Ambassador is ushered to the Finnish Government's official headquarters. There the mob of intense reporters is locked out, and the only man in a suit the Ambassador must face is the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, what he lacks in numbers he more than makes up for in intensity: there seems no escaping from his intense, silent gaze.\n\nAt least the conversation starts cordial. The Ambassador makes polite small talk, drawing from the little he knows of the Finnish within his own country: he talks of music, culture, shared brotherhood. The Prime Minister replies in kind, but there is something in his eyes that reminds the Ambassador of a butcher checking his latest cut for its weight and value. Something transactional, something shallow.\n\nThen the Prime Minister looks him in the eye and asks: What is the status of the occupied territory of Karelia? The room seems to drop a hundred degrees in minutes. What answer could there possibly be?\n\nAs the Ambassador squirms in his seat, a fish fresh out of water, the Prime Minister guffaws and bear-hugs him. Welcome to Finland, he says.

 komi_dem_generic.39.d: "An interesting offer has recently come to the State Department from the embassy of the [KOM.GetName]. The country controls a series of ports along the White Sea, in the far north of Russia, near Finland and the Baltic region. While the sea is fairly quiet these days, there is a substantial amount of military infrastructure left over from when ports like Arkhangelsk were controlled by the West Russian Revolutionary Front. The WRFR is offering to give us basing rights at these ports, in exchange for a yearly increase to their aid funding of approximately 550 million dollars. While this sum may seem eye-popping at first, it's a rounding error for a budget as big as the USA's, and in exchange, the US Navy would have a toehold deep in the heart of Russia, within striking distance of numerous strategic targets. What should we do?"

Negotiations over the agreement broke down, and unfortunately, they broke down quite publicly. Word of the failure has already made its way to the press, and some commentators are calling for the foreign minister to resign over the matter.

The Democratic Socialist People's Party, supporting democratic socialism in the Republic, have started to spread their message of equality and worker's rights. This has gained the support of the poor and the workers of Russia, who now see the DSNP as a party for the poor. It seems the DSNP will have a lot of support from the laborers and the working class.\n\nThe Democratic Socialist's promises for equality in the Republic have also gained the support of many laborers and farmers alike, unhappy with their conditions and especially with the landowners that have been gaining power ever since the collapse of authority in the warlord era. However, the DSNP's past scandals still hurts the party to this day, and it may be an uphill battle to win the election."

They didn't seem interested in him, more glad to have a break than anything. Voznesensky knew he would have to make a good speech to get these workers on his side.\n\n\"Laborers of Gorky, I come here with promises. Promises of workers' rights, healthcare, higher wages, safety regulations, more pay and fewer hours. You have worked tirelessly for Russia. Whether you produce tanks or toys, you are the ones who will be building a better Russia. Not the politicians, not the economists, but you, the worker. Producing weapons or civilian goods, you make a better Russia for us all, one step at a time.\"\n\nThe workers had begun to perk up, it seemed like they were becoming more interested in what Voznesensky had to say. \"For all you have done, I thank you. But I wouldn't be doing anything if I was just congratulating you or giving out promises, would I? I assure you, in my presidency, the workers will be my top priority. Your hard work will no longer be unrewarded! For what you do for this country, you will be duly compensated. I promise all of you, no worker of this republic will ever be ignored again!\"\n\nAs he finished the speech, Voznesensky looked into the eyes of everyone in the room.

Containing the ideals for a democratic socialist state, the DSNP wants to reach as much of the masses as possible to win the election.\n\nThe pamphlets include writings from prominent DSNP members and the party's platform. As such, the pamphlet mentions the DSNP's plan to increase workers' rights in great detail. Plans of workplace democracy, empowering unions, and increased pay have been promised to all the workers of the Republic. The pamphlet also goes on to say how the DSNP plans to transition the Republic into a socialist democracy and a socialized economy, creating a republic of equality. Still, many doubt the DSNP, if elected, could successfully implement any of their reforms."

From the large cities to the small villages, Sovereign Democratic Party presence can be seen almost everywhere. A platform for a strong, sovereign Russia, the PSD hopes to appeal to everyone, the factory workers, the farmers, and the business owners. The Sovereign Democratic Party hopes anyone who cares for their motherland will vote for them in the coming elections.\n\nThe PSD, hoping to steal votes from other parties as well, are also promising social democratic and capitalist policies. Social policies as well as free-market economics are becoming a main point of the Sovereign Democratic Party. One thing is for sure, the PSD should not be underestimated."

Containing the ideals for a strong and independent Russia that stands above its enemies, the pamphlet has many promises for the future, hoping to gain the support of every Russian.\n\nAs written in the pamphlet, the Sovereign Democratic Party has promised a social-democratic republic, one that does not ignore the poor and in need, yet bashes the DSNP for its radical ideas. The pamphlet also advertises anti-extremism and anti-radicalism, denouncing both fascism and communism. The PSD has also promised more liberal social policies, advocating for equality and liberty. Most important to the PSD however, is the reclamation of Russia. In their platform, the PSD has promised to focus efforts on reunifying the motherland, no matter the cost. With this, the Republic under the PSD can expect an increase in the size of the military and preparations for a war economy.\n\nIt's certain the PSD has much support, but will a platform of war and reclamation work with everyone?"

 komi_dem_generic.47.d: "It was a brisk, cool morning in the Republic's capital.

Our young republic is surrounded by those who wish to destroy it, just as it was ten years before. We cannot make the same mistakes! We must all be stronger. The failure that led to the destruction of the revolutionary front by Germany must not end our Republic as well. And to the east are even greater threats. Rival governments that claim they are the true government of Russia. Warlords who wish to conquer and pillage our homes and destroy our democracy. We must defend our families, our Russia!\"\n\nThe crowd seemed to be growing larger now, so Stalina began to speak louder. \"A PSD victory means a Russia that can defend itself from aggression, and a Russia that can take the upper hand. If we want to defeat those who threaten us, we must strike first. Russia needs a large to defend herself. If we appear weak, our enemies will strike us down. Vote PSD, and save Russia!\""

And they would not, either. Too far did they fall from Taboritsky's gaze. Too strongly were they influenced by the workings of madmen - the lunatics of Zion ever-cursed by the mark of Cain, the murderers and bandits that belonged in the clique of the Communists, and the atheistic spirits who gouged their own eyes out in the name of progress, who silenced their ears to listen to the cry of democracy, and cut their own tongues out to join the ignoble masses. His were the pleas of sanity that were left to rot in the dirt, in likeness of their belief that Tsarevich Alexei did stand in waiting, did not hide in shadows until Russia's savior would come at last, that he was 'dead', 'executed'.\n\nThe case of Komi was one of undoctored insanity, and Taboritsky would not wait for its ill effects to pass on to him. There was a new place to go, and only one stood in the ashes of Russia as something perhaps passable, perhaps not. This so-called 'Aryan Brotherhood', and to get there he had to go through the land of Vyatka. The false Tsar, he would not pity him by remembering his name, was nothing to him.

It was difficult to make use of her previous tricks in this grey Hell.\n\nHer objective had been sighted in just the sort of circumstance she expected. Down the hall from her cell was the blocks they used for solitary confinement - blocks that she occasionally heard faint screams from. Screams that made her grit her teeth, and pace across the few square meters of space that she had been permitted by the Government's mercy. In the time she had spent to stare through the bars at the corridor, she had seen two guards dragging a short woman between them, away from solitary - a woman who still extruded an aura of ashen defiance and faded passion. A woman who she had known all too well.\n\nIn the distant past, she had considered eventually breaking her will as a sad inevitability, something that had to be done to realize her vision. But looking into her eyes whilst she had been dragged down the corridor betrayed a different outcome than the one she had expected. Whilst her infamous stark white suits had long been replaced by prison orange, whilst her formerly disciplined and tightly bound hair hung loose and unkempt, Svetlana Stalina was unbowed and unbroken. The Lady of Steel, it seemed, had merely been tempered, and not shattered.\n\nAs she passed on down the corridor, and out of view, Bukharina felt a thin smile cross her face. They may have been bitter foes - opponents that both recognized the other would have to go in order to build the future they desired.

Yakovlev served in the Red Army during the German invasion, and the horrors he experienced on the Front, including almost losing an arm during the invasion.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fracturing of the country into multiple warlords, Yakovlev's life had been shattered, as the strength and truth of Marxist-Leninism right in front of his eyes. The destruction of his country and ideology forced him to look at Socialism through a different lens, one in which human happiness and quality of life trumped ideological purity.\n\nAfter winning a difficult election in the recently conquered Arkhangelsk Oblast against the wishes of the DSNP establishment, he has established himself as a prominent freshman in the Oblast. Intelligent and reform minded, it remains to be seen whether his left wing credentials can gain him the political power he desires."

He has been instrumental to the Democratic Front in helping ensure party loyalty among Deputies coming from the former Front and elsewhere. While technically coming from a new territory, Yakovlev has been succeeding in straddling the line between being associated either with the party establishment in Syktyvkar or the frontier, making himself out as a possible unifier in the young republic.\n\nHowever, his desire for compromise extends only so far, as many on the right of the DSNP are well aware. Yakovlev's public criticism of those in his own party who have 'betrayed our socialist roots' has made him popular among leftists in Komi. While his economic policies are far from radical in Russia, his forcefulness in such criticism has since made him a prominent member of the left of his party.\n\nWhile still young and inexperienced in the ways of government, it is expected among the party establishment that he will do great things."

With his fiery criticism of the right DSNP's liberal economic policies and a firebrand desire to uplift the working class of his nation through a newfound humanistic socialism, many expect Yakovlev to seek the Presidency.\n\nAlthough he has kept any hints of seeking the presidency to himself, it remains to be seen if Yakovlev's coalition can overcome the party establishment."

This, combined with his support among the former Front held regions, has now catapulted him into his status as a major Presidential candidate.\n\nWhile many on the right of the DSNP grumble about Yakovlev, the center and left wing are openly congratulating the candidate on his victory, and are expected to have even greater representation in the National Assembly.

While his candidacy has just been announced, Yakovlev has met with many trade unionists in both core Komi territory and in former Front territory, which were all met with positivity among working class voters and trade union bureaucracy.\n\nWhile many considered Alexander Yakovlev to be a dark horse in the People's Democratic Socialist Party's primary, his unexpected victory has since capitulated his already impressive political record to new heights. His powerful political connections in the Front's former territory, in addition to his harsh criticism of the right wing of his party, has made him the darling of the left within the Komi Republic.

 komidiplo.62.d: "Unsurprisingly, the neutral government of Vologda has wisely decided to submit to our demands rather than subject their lands to the ravages of war. We shall begin the process of integration immediately, and our soldiers have already crossed the border to ensure our rule is solidified."
 komidiplo.62.a: "Neutrality is overrated."
 komidiplo.63.t: "Vologda Refuses to Submit!"
 komidiplo.63.d: "The neutral zone of Vologda has, bafflingly, decided to defy our demands and refuse integration! They clearly do not understand that the odds are against them, and would rather risk a military confrontation than give up their misguided independence. Their army is woefully inferior compared to ours, and isn't expected to put up much resistance."
 komidiplo.63.a: "We will crush them!"
 komidiplo.64.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Breaks off Ties"
 komidiplo.64.d: "Worrying news from our supposed \"allies\" of Ust-Sysolsk. The government in Syktyvkar has decided, in defiance of any rational explanation, to nullify their treaty of mutual assistance with the Empire.\n\nWe can only guess why they've done this, but it is almost certainly because they desire our lands. Our scouts already report concerning troop movements across our borders, so we must be prepared for anything. If Ust-Sysolsk truly is planning to attack, we cannot afford to be caught off-guard."
 komidiplo.64.a: "We never should've trusted them!"
 komidiplo.65.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands Our Submission!"
 komidiplo.65.d: "A message has been received from the neighboring statelet of Ust-Sysolsk, demanding in no uncertain terms for all our forces to stand down. This is hardly a bold-faced bluff on their part, as their armies have already mobilized to our borders in the event of our refusal.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation indeed. Should we surrender, there's no telling what will become of our soldiers, who have engaged in acts of banditry across the entire region. On the other hand, remaining defiant could result in far more death than if we were to just surrender..."

Our troops have secured control over Gorky and its important mechanized factories without so much as a shot fired, and the integration of the region proceeds as planned."
 komidiplo.66.a: "How fortuitous."
 komidiplo.67.t: "Gorky Refuses!"
 komidiplo.67.d: "Unsurprisingly, the bandits of Gorky stand defiant in the face of our demands and are preparing to do battle with our forces. Despite having them outnumbered, the bandits' vast fleet of tanks may prove to be a challenging obstacle indeed. That being said, they cannot hope to hold out against our comparatively vast army for too long."

 komidiplo.68.t: "A Letter to Tatarstan"
 komidiplo.68.d: "Our relations with the West Russian states that we reluctantly call our neighbors are limited, at best. In truth, the Tatarstan Republic finds little need for a world that has mostly abandoned it, and as our economy and workforce face the problems inherent to a newborn state, even that is steadily decreasing in importance. For the most part, we are alone, and we would be happy to stay that way.\n\nIt appears this isolation has now been forcibly ended.\n\nThe letter from the new leader of the Republic to our north has more to it than a mere notice of name-change: its new leader, Gumilyov, speaks to a union of flesh and steel that he envisions will one day stretch across the long band of the Urals. It is, in his defence, a very well-argued concept, even if it sounds like the babblings of a madman, and some on our soil have been noticeably swayed by the Pan-Eurasian siren. It does not help that the letter promises religious pluralism and respect for our ancient creed; our men are warriors of faith as well as champions of industry, and Gumilyov's promises of a minimal degree of respect are inherently appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, these promises inevitably come at a cost. Gumilyov calls for our righteous submission, and as he phrases it, \"much will come of our work together - our place is one of humble leadership, and yours of loyal and righteous service\". These are controversial words, and the best we can say about them is that they are not quite as bad as what we would expect from your average Russian Alexander-to-be."

 komidiplo.69.d: "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nThe Accession Instrument is simple: in exchange for privileged treatment as an ethnic minority following a noble creed, the Tatars shall swear political allegiance to us and fold their own government into ours. The Tatar economy shall also take marching orders from our own leadership, although it is in truth more difficult to constrain their thriving caravan economy than it would be to herd cats.\n\nOur Leader has expressed good cheer at this news, and he has issued a Pan-Eurasian call to unity to be read in the new territory's mosques. Surely the noble Moslems of the region will greet their new brothers with open arms..."
 komidiplo.69.a: "Glory to our brothers from Tatarstan!"
 komidiplo.70.t: "A Temporary Resistance"
 komidiplo.70.d: "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nUnfortunately, there have been complications in enlightening the Tatars as to the obvious benefits to their accession. We have received a stiffly-worded refusal in exchange, citing only \"natural political and cultural concerns\" as their primary reasons. Pah! The Teacher's embrace is all the political and cultural incentive these misguided Muhammedans could ever desire, and it is to their detriment that they are blind to our compassions.\n\nNo matter - the refusal is purely a temporary matter. Our divisions are preparing to bring the inevitability of Eurasian rebirth to Tatar soil. Let the grasses weep; we will join soil with soil regardless."
 komidiplo.70.a: "They will come to regret this."
 komidiplo.71.t: "Gumilyov's Invitation"
 komidiplo.71.d: "The land of Komi has been atumble with political intrigue for as long as can be remembered: now, however, something entirely new has emerged from the chaos, and the new leadership has set its sights on us. Their leader, Gumilyov, professes a strange creed proclaiming unity with all brothers and sisters of the land, and they have even sent us a strange advertisement proclaiming a common \"base of faith, tolerance and ardor\" - our imams are confused, to say the least, but they appreciate the proposal.\n\nQuestions of religious tolerance aside, we do not possess any illusions as to the true nature of their proposal. Gumilyov claims that our men and armaments will be subsumed into a larger cause, one that aims to bring unity to the steppes. What he conveniently neglects to mention is that this endeavour will require colossal amounts of bloodshed; much of it, no doubt, our own.\n\nSome on our soil, however, have found his beliefs persuasive: just the other day we had to lock up an itinerant preacher with some strange ideas about this Eurasianism, and a domestic crowd rallies to the defense of a Russia we thought dead decades ago. Opposing them is most of our domestic political establishment, the latter of whom believe Gumilyov's strange ideas regarding the Rus are merely proof that Ust-Sysolsk truly is a land for madmen.\n\nWell, madmen or not, we must decide. Unity or independence? Peace or war?"
 komidiplo.71.a: "Let us go with Gumilyov."
 komidiplo.72.b: "We stand alone!"
 komidiplo.72.t: "The Integration of Bashkiria"
 komidiplo.72.d: "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nUfa is festooned with the banners of Eurasia today, bearing witness to the arrival of the Teacher Gumilyov - in his first public address to the new province, Gumilyov read verses from the Koran and promised to uphold a \"staunch brotherhood and mutual respect\" between all peoples. This was met with cheers from a mostly amused crowd, although a few upstart imams have also been arrested for trying to cause trouble. We are certain that the troublesome talk of resistance some of these incendiaries have seeded in the population will take some time to weed out as well...\n\nWell, it is not all bad news. The religious and political establishment of Ufa have already sworn allegiance to their new superiors, and the principles of Eurasian Fraternity have been successfully rolled out in the provincial education system. Military recruitment is also progressing as well as can be hoped, although the existing officer corps is taking longer than usual to accommodate our new oaths. Perhaps a visit from State Security is in order?\n\nWell, that is all I can report from Ufa this week. We congratulate the Teacher on his success - may Eurasia be reborn from the blood and resolve of our brothers!"
 komidiplo.72.a: "Glory to Gumilyov!"
 komidiplo.73.t: "Stubborn Fools!"
 komidiplo.73.d: "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nWe recognize now that our efforts to promote brotherhood and common cause between us and these damnable Bashkirians were doomed from the start; is it some peculiar fault of the constitution that engenders a lack of common sense? Is it a failed education system that causes the blindness of its leadership? Either way, the result is clear: Bashkiria has rejected our proposal for unity, and they have even gone so far as to expel our Consulate with your most humble servant included! What an insult to the Eurasian ideal, and to the Teacher himself!\n\nWe have succeeded in drawing perhaps a few hundred to the fold, and some have promised to leave this misguided land altogether to join the Leader, but there is little hope that this quasi-state will ever be persuaded to join us peacefully. Some of their most notable imams have thrown us a statement outright denying our tolerance and calling us the \"spittle of Satan\", in fact. Insults aside, we should not anticipate a peaceful occupation should we decide to militarily intervene.\n\nWe must prepare for the worst: eventually they will come to accept that our rule is a benevolent one, no matter how much blood is spent on their conviction."

 komidiplo.74.d: "Kazembek's watching the guard escort the Eternal Loyalty convoy to the gates when the message comes. The sky is foggy and the wind gnaws at everything, such that the messenger's words are almost lost in the whirl:\n\n\"Ust-Sytolsk wants our terms, Sir!\"\n\nThere is little doubt what he means: Vyatka's active government has long warned of such a possibility. Ust-Sytolsk is run by an insane demagogue who demands the blood of his countrymen to spill in rivers for his deluded fantasy of Eurasianism, but it was believed his madness would gutter out long before he became a threat. Instead, his armies are here and an imminent threat.\n\nKazembek's meeting with his little cabinet is brief. All other options are denied them; Gumilyov demands submission or war, and there is no room for negotiation. Nor will this fight be anything but a fait accompli for the limited military strength of the statelet: they cannot hope to sustain more than a relentless retreat or a single, hopeless stand.\n\nThere is one last choice to be made, and no dignity in either option. Kazembek sighs, like something being released from his spirit, and chooses."
 komidiplo.74.a: "Submission."
 komidiplo.74.b: "War."
 komidiplo.75.t: "A Resignation"
 komidiplo.75.d: "Berezniki's choice is clear when the morning comes: the border garrison notes mass surrenders of border troops and a rapid breakdown of anything resembling coherent resistance. As the armies march into the statelet, they encounter a mostly subdued scene: thugs running People's Battalions pushing prisoners forth stop patrols and offer their charges to soldiers before running away, and villages offer only temporary rest and aid before shooing confused officers away.\n\nThe leadership having surrendered, its administrative apparatus begins the slow process of moving towards Gumilyov's own government, and there it receives a rude awakening. Civil servants and democratic dissenters trade homes and offices for the prison-camps, and there is nothing resembling fair trials for the intelligentsia already under arrest by the previous regime. Instead, for a select few who have earned the wrath of the Eurasianists, there is a bullet in the dead of night as the sum total of mercy offered.\n\nBerezniki dies with these quick arrests - the rest offer submission, and Gumilyov's regime is quick to begin the next step of ensuring loyalty. Young men are rounded up in squares and markets, the perennial harvest of all states, and offered the choice:"
 komidiplo.75.a: "Serve Eurasia or die for yourself."
 komidiplo.76.t: "A Simple Refusal"
 komidiplo.76.d: "Berezniki makes its stance clear in the dead of night: the envoy from Ust-Systolsk is expelled and his guard unceremoniously shot as a warning, and as he is taken back to the border by People's Battalions he records the following:\n\n\"Watching a convulsion of violence erupt, from the safety of my truck: here and there bonfires and shouts, and I hear screams from the grasslands. They are rooting out sympathisers, some real, many imagined, and they intend to sear it out of them.\"\n\n\"We are passing by the ruins of a village. The smell is fresh, acrid. Greasy. I ask: what happened to these people? The guard snorts and turns away, saying only: they opposed the People's Tsar.\"\n\n\"For the first time since coming, I can no longer trust the honor of the Mladorossi. It is now apparent they are violent, angry people, and they cannot be trusted in peace any more than they can be offered mercy in war.\"\n\nThe report has been met by accusations of bias and outright fabrication by their own representative in our regime, but he has been expelled from the country as well: there will be no room to rebut this, and it does make a convenient narrative to rally around."

 komi.22.d: "Bukharina had an empty desk in the Ministry of Culture that she wanted filled, but she had reached an obstacle. Yekatarina Furtseva: Ultravisionary in disguise, or a true believer in Bukharina's ideals? She had recently renounced Zhdanov and thrown her support behind Bukharina, but was she genuine? This question had stumped the Chairwoman for a few minutes now.\n\nLooking into her past, Furtseva had first gained the Communist Party's attention by writing a scathing critique of a film displayed in a Syktyvkar theater and its satire of the former Soviet Union's leadership. She called for the Communist Party to boycott the theater until it cut all ties with the film's director and stopped displaying the film. It had worked, and she was elected to the former Republic's National Assembly later that year. Furtseva had arrived before Bukharina's popularity surged, and had already allied with Zhdanov when Bukharina arrived in Syktyvkar. This past could mean that she was a reformist, and renounced Zhdanov when it became clear that Bukharina was the real force for reform within Syktyvkar. Alternatively, she was always an Ultravisionary, and was working with them to undermine Bukharina.\n\nFurtseva clearly cared about cultural matters, and clearly wanted to ensure that revolutionary ideals properly reached the public. The question was: what ideals? The position was fairly limited as well, a mere administrative manager, but it was the principle that mattered. Bukharina needed not necessarily trust, but at least a guarantee that members of her government didn't seek to undermine her authority."

 komi.25.d: "A freezing wind blew in Arkhangelsk as a man in an admiral's uniform walked through its currently mostly empty streets. Between nightfall and the relatively new occupiers of the city, most people wanted to remain indoors for the time being. The man couldn't blame them much; Russia was certainly going through a scary time, and it was hard to trust any government after what some of them had been said to treat the people they ruled. Still, the people aside, it was nice to have an actual port for a change, and he'd put it to good use, or his name wasn't Timur Gaidar.\n\nSomething in the corner of his eye caught his attention, and he turned to get a better look at it. It was a book somebody had abandoned on the ground, and Timur picked it up to read the title. He barely avoided dropping the book when he did.\n\nIt was the book Timur and His Squad, the last written work his father, Arkady, had ever made. It had become a widely cherished children's book in areas of Russia still controlled by communists, and even among the communists in Syktyvkar. It was a story of a young communist boy named Timur and his friends helping the public and furthering the revolution in any way he could... and it was all based on him. Timur Gaidar had once been the very boy that Arkady Gaidar had modeled the Timur of the book off of.\n\nIt was incredible to think of how long ago it had been published. 1940, a year before the invasion. He had been a young boy then, an eager Bolshevik, following in his father's footsteps. Now he served people his father would angrily declare traitors to the revolution. Ah, revolution. What a joke. The revolution, the war, what had they been worth? They'd just made his father waste his life and die needlessly. If the path Timur took now was a betrayal of that revolution, if it made his father turn over in his grave, then so be it."

A deserter from the Wehrmacht, he despised the Nazis with every fiber of his being, had ever since they had murdered his father when Fritz was just 16 years old, had ever since they had imprisoned him for daring to think differently, had ever since they had killed the partisans he had deserted to join after years of fighting, and forced him to flee deep into Russia. His German grew rusty, these days, for when he spoke it people looked at him with a mixture of fear, suspicion, and disgust. He could not blame them, not a single one of them. Every Nazi he had killed, every part of Russia he helped bring into the Soviet fold once more, scarcely compared to the countless sins committed by his people. Schmenkel wondered if he would go to heaven, as the Christians claimed people did, when he died. If not, at the very least he would make sure a mountain of dead Nazis awaited him in fear at the deepest pit of hell."

Though they favored different factions, both men had remained friends for over a decade, and small differences in politics weren't about to change that now.\n\nThey had little left besides each other, after all.\n\n\"A toast!\" Kantorovich declared joyously. \"To the freedom of Russia, and the salvation of the Jewish people.\"\n\nLooking around in alarm, Liberman let out a breath when he realized the pub was empty except for themselves and the staff. \"Careful, Leonid.\" He hissed. \"Much as we've worked to heal Russia of its bigotry, many remain who would hate us for who we are. The brainless goons of people like Shafarevich and Gumilyov still want our heads, to say nothing of the Reich and their jackbooted dogs. Hatred surrounds us, my friend, and it will take a long time for it to cool.\"\n\nA small, sad, smile on his face, Kantorovich shook his head. \"That is precisely why we must celebrate! We have saved at least part of Russia from itself, and in doing so brought the hated Reich a step closer to its demise. If we do not celebrate who we are in a situation like this, we may as well be as dead as so many of our people.\"\n\nHis brow furrowing in worry, Liberman locked eyes with Kantorovich, catching his attention. \"Maybe that's so.\" He admitted, his expression troubled. \"Even still, I need you to promise me one thing.\""

 komi.30.d: "His old teacher had not had much time of late for mathematics. Evgeny Golod returned to the living room with the new kettle of tea. Igor Shafarevich sat hunched over the table, observing neatly arrayed piles of papers. Outside, the bustle of daily activity was winding down, at this hour between lunch and late afternoon.\n\nThe pair had spent most of the day exploring the Burnside problem, and others like it in group theory. Would a finitely generated group in which elements have finite order would be a finite group? Intuition seemed to say yes. How could finite elements of limited scope generate that which is boundless? Yet, naive intuition was dangerous to any mathematician. Now, the algebraists had an angle of attack toward building a counter-example. For a given field, an infinite dimensional quotient group could be built under certain conditions. From there, solving Burnside's problem was much simplified; all one had to do was create such a quotient group generated by finitely many elements of finite order. This would warrant at least some interest in Russia's dwindling mathematical community. Perhaps in the outer world, someday?\n\nVerifications were moving ahead rapidly. Golod leaned back into his chair, the warmness of the tea mixing with the satisfaction of work well done. In this instant it was so easy to imagine a path not travelled, a Russia not ravaged by war, not divided by scheming generals and politicians. A nation where his friend and mentor had a career as a distinguished academic, instead of his current occupation within the pack of jackals of the Passionary organization. These past few years, Golod had lost himself in his mathematics, to try to blot out the outside world. Perhaps his friend would live to come out on top of Komi's politics. Perhaps he'd be murdered, or exiled. In the meantime, could Golod blame himself for seeking some friendship, some memories of a better past, of an impossible future, with his old colleague?"

Shafarevich was excited to read about their findings. A bit melancholy, perhaps, that war ravaged Russia had not kept up. All dissapointments were soon forgotten as he read the papers, sipping tea every now and then.\n\nA few developments caught the politician's eyes. It seems that the Americans Serge Lang and John Tate had centered some of their work around what come to be known as the Tate-Lang group. This group consisted of the elements of the Weil-Châtelet group of a number field K that are trivial within all completions of K. This notion had equally emerged from Shafarevich's work in the fifties with collaborators. Intriguingly, the Americans had not been able to determine if such a group was finite. This had been one of the open questions in the Russian Algebra community as well. Shafaverich had no idea if the question was entertained in Germany; early translations of Japanese papers did not seem to indicate much interest in the question from the far east.\n\n\"John Tate\", Shafaverich spoke to himself. His methods were good. His papers were written elegantly, precisely. In another world where America and Russia had not been separated by catastrophe, perhaps both men could have collaborated. Shafaverich shook his head again, smiling. He wasted so much time dreaming of useless dreams."

Born to a peasant family in Korolyova, Yakolev's father was a Red Cavalryman during the Civil War and an important leader in the local agricultural commune. Raised in such an environment, at a young age he became an ideological adherent to Marxist-Leninism. Under normal circumstances, he might have even become an important local politician, and maybe even beyond. But the German invasion changed all that.\n\nConscripted in the Red Army, Yakovlev saw how easily Marxist-Leninism fell to the hoards of German soldiers, crushed beneath the tire treads of Panzers, then, after it was all done, shattered into a thousand bickering generals and warlords. Such destruction forced Yakovlev to view socialism through a different, more independent lens - a view that placed human dignity above ideological purity.\n\nOriginally a member of Zhukov's clique in the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he has adapted well to the Russian Republic, organizing the Arkhangelsk Oblast into a DSNP stronghold. A firm member of his party's left flank, he has made himself famous as an orator of populist values.

This, together with his natural administrative abilities and affable personality, allowed him to rapidly advance towards the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nA physicist by education and trade, Kardashev takes his goal of scientific advancement very seriously. Despite this, however, he is not a member of the so-called 'orthodox' wing of the faction, and indeed disagrees with many of their projects and pursuits. Dismissing the many pseudo-scientific pursuits of others towards a nebulous 'superculture,' he instead concentrates upon economic affairs.\n\nThis expresses itself in his tireless advocacy and pursuit of developments supporting what he considers to be true ultravisionary socialism - a fusion economy where science serves the people and permits the creation of a post-scarcity society. Though many scoff at this dream, Kardashev knows it is achievable.\n\nAnd he intends to make sure that it is so realized."

This includes strong support for initiatives relating to space exploration as well as the ideological concept of the ultravisionary superculture.\n\nIndeed, he believes this to such an extent that he holds it as a simple fact that space is the natural 'next frontier' of the terrestrial Cold War. Securing victory in space, therefore, means securing victory on Earth, and vice versa.\n\nAnd he intends to do everything possible to ensure that the Federation achieves that victory."

The West Siberian People's Republic, led by one Mikhail Kaganovich, had unified a quarter of Russia. Stalina would have dismissed them as any other Soviet warlord, except that these communists idolized Joseph Stalin, Stalina's father.\n\nAccording to Kaganovich, \"Stalinism\" consisted of an exceptionally hardline interpretation of communist ideology, with highly-centralized power and a focus on mass-industrialization. Stalina's father had died when she was young, but it seemed accurate to what she remembered of him.\n\nEither way, it didn't matter what specific strain of communist belief Kaganovich spouted, because at the end of the day they were still communists.

 katushev.1.t: "The Iron Governor"
 katushev.1.d: "With the recent integration of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky, into the Republic, it was considered essential to establish legitimate governance within both it and the surrounding region.\n\nElections for all positions, legislative and executive, were therefore announced and subsequently held. Although many races were competitive, one in particular - the Governor's - was not. Konstantin Katushev, a local engineer and industrialist, and notable for his long-standing support of and advocacy for broadly liberal policies, won by a considerable margin.\n\nKatushev, who entered the regional political sphere as soon as he was able, quickly negotiated with and secured the endorsement of the SMR, commonly known as the Young Reformers, and began proclaiming their general position to the electorate. Proving himself an exceptionally skilled political organizer, he quickly established both a robust and rapidly expanding political infrastructure, greatly expanding local awareness of and support for democratic ideals.\n\nThis infrastructure proved an insurmountable challenge for his opponents, as though several other campaigns outspent Katushev by a considerable margin, none were able to significantly challenge the increasing momentum displayed by his own.\n\nExperts agree that the 'Iron Governor,' as he has been increasingly referred to, is likely to leverage that infrastructure in order to further establish Nizhny Novgorod as a stronghold, both for the Reformers and for their political adherents."
 katushev.1.a: "A rising star, indeed."
 katushev.2.t: "The Party Machine"
 katushev.2.d: "As was previously predicted by experts, the continued efforts of the SMR-aligned 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, to establish Nizhny Novgorod as a bastion of liberal idealism have shown results.\n\nOnce again demonstrating a profound talent for organization, Katushev moved quickly following his election to identify local allies, particularly among those who carefully concealed democratic leanings under the former regime, and then appoint them to politically influential positions. Although many of these allies have been criticized by Katushev's opponents as inexperienced and 'eccentric,' counting among their number political novices from numerous menial careers, their inclusion has won Katushev the support of many within the city.\n\nWhile tirelessly working to continuously further expand the political infrastructure established during his election campaign, Katushev has begun to apply that infrastructure in support of the candidacy of other SMR prospects. Indeed, many of the city's National Assembly districts are now held by SMR deputies, and experts predict that the degree of support extended by Katushev's machine is such that they are unlikely to be unseated by their many opponents anytime soon.\n\nUnder Katushev, Nizhny Novgorod has very quickly become a political bastion of the Young Reformers, and the influence of this fact on the political landscape of the Republic as a whole is expected to grow in the months and years ahead."
 katushev.2.a: "A beacon of liberalism."
 katushev.3.t: "From Oblast to Nation"
 katushev.3.d: "The political influence of Nizhny Novgorod, as one of the largest cities in Western Russia and thus the source of a significant proportion of the National Assembly's deputies, has continued to grow. As has the influence of its 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev.\n\nKatushev's now-extensive political infrastructure and, consequently, his ability to mobilize support for the SMR within the region has led to other parties being all but shut out of its Assembly delegation. Indeed, deputies from Katushev's 'domain' now constitute a considerable portion of the entire Young Reformer caucus, affecting the party's viewpoint as a whole. Recognizing this, the SMR has begun shifting more and more of its administrative organs, other than those required in Syktyvkar itself, to the city.\n\nA corollary to this shift in both caucus demographics and organization is the rapidly increasing influence of Katushev within the party on the national level. He has reportedly begun making 'suggestions' on electoral and positional policy, and it is considered likely that other figures within the SMR's senior leadership will be unable to resist them.\n\nAmong oppositional party organizers, consensus has therefore been reached that Katushev is to be considered a critical and near-irreplaceable figure within the SMR, and he has been identified as a prime candidate for potential party leadership in the near future."

 katushev.4.t: "Morozov Announces Retirement"
 katushev.4.d: "Earlier today, President Ivan Morozov announced that he would not seek re-election upon the expiration of his current term, and would instead be retiring from political life.\n\nIn a brief speech, Morozov made the proclamation while speaking about his personal political journey, from his time spent in the Soviet state apparatus to his arrival in the Republic and later foundation of the Young Reformers. He exhorted the Republic and Assembly to remain true to the principles of democracy and liberalism on which he was elected, and emphasized to his eventual successor the importance of rejecting radicalism of all types within the national political discourse. He subsequently ended his speech with thanks to his many political allies and other confederates.\n\nWhile some experts had correctly theorized the purpose of Morozov's speech, most appeared to have been taken by some degree of surprise. Whatever the criticisms held by opponents against Morozov, and they were many, all could generally agree that he had long desired to see political stability in the Republic.\n\nWhether the race for the Presidency, which has been galvanized by the announcement, will possess such stability is currently unknown."
 katushev.4.a: "The end of an era."
 katushev.5.t: "The New Reformer"
 katushev.5.d: "The meteoric rise of the 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, has continued unabated as he has recently secured the leadership of the SMR as a whole and thus, its official nomination for the upcoming Presidential election.\n\nLeveraging his enormous personal support and political influence within Nizhny Novgorod in the wake of the three-time SMR candidate Ivan Morozov's recent announcement of retirement, he moved quickly to position himself as a candidate for succession. Although other senior party figures soon did the same, much as it did in his earlier gubernatorial election, Katushev's early advantage and quick action proved decisive, and he was elected leader of the SMR on the first ballot.\n\nThis surprised many observers, who were expecting multiple rounds of negotiation by candidates among the SMR caucus. However, as was evidenced, the increasing degree of party centrality upon Nizhny Novgorod overwhelmingly favored Katushev, and support for other contenders was seen to quickly collapse among the contingents of SMR deputies not already from districts in or around the city.\n\nHaving secured his party's nomination, Katushev is soon, along with the candidates put forward by other parties, expected to begin his national campaign for the presidency. While many have expressed certainty that the policies of the Young Reformers are likely to find little support outside urban centres, others have been quick to identify Katushev's skills at attractively packaging SMR ideology.\n\nOnly time will tell which opinion proves correct."

 katushev.6.d: "Konstantin Katushev, known nationally as the 'Iron Governor' and the SMR's nominee for President, today officially launched his campaign in his personal and party stronghold of Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nSurprising many, his commencement speech made no mention of socialist concepts, long considered a cornerstone of SMR ideology. Instead, Katushev spoke strongly in the support of promoting national modernization through comprehensive programs of ecological conservation, the enshrinement of meritocratic principles in both public and private sectors, and in promoting general economic prosperity through the invitation of foreign investment and bilateral trade.\n\nPolitical pundits were quick to respond, with those sympathetic to the SMR praising Katushev's speech as a focused vision for Russia's future. Those opposed were equally quick in decrying it as a thinly veiled attempt to conceal the 'fundamentally socialist' nature of any SMR policies from rural voting blocs.\n\nRegardless of expert interpretation, however, Katushev's speech drew intense interest from many communities across the Republic, urban and rural alike, and the SMR was quick to capitalize on this by issuing an immediate appeal for both the recruitment of local campaign organizers and of general fundraising.\n\nThough a long campaign remains, and none can yet be sure of the election's eventual outcome, Katushev and the Young Reformers have managed to secure a strong starting position."

Combined in one of the Assembly building's offices, they gathered other like-minded members of the Center and gathered all evidence, notes, and observations they have about the political situation in Komi.\n\n\"The left is divided between 'reformist' and 'orthodox' lines, with yet another division in their orthodox caucus.\" Elena presented.\n\n\"Furthermore, the right is extremely ideologically fragmented as well. Fascists, Eurasianists, Shafarevichites, and Monarchists do not mix well.\" Yevgeny added. \"We're convinced that the Center has the greatest chance for unity and the greatest chance to appeal to the common voter, despite the obstacles we may face.\"\n\n\"Like what?

Not anymore, but God forbid they found out. They'd sweep the entire PSD under the rug as despots and fascist sympathizers in disguise.\" Yegveny thought to himself deeply, looking at the stars forming in the night sky.\n\n\"Hey, Yevgeny!\" He panicked, dropping his cigarette and matchbox into the street below, and turning around to see Elena. \"I came here to drop off some papers to you. You don't look so well though. Should I come back later, or..?\"\n\nThe two of them talked for what seemed like hours, despite being only a few short minutes. \"Elena, I have to come clean.

A stalwart anti-extremist, more so than any other democratic leader at the moment, the government passed a motion of support in favor of her to enact some of her plans in order to protect the Center from the Left. While the entirety of the PSD is overjoyed right now, the largest majority of NO votes came from the SMR. Elena was the only member of the SMR who abstained, and wasn't too excited about the following resolution.\n\n\"Hey, Elena. The vote's got you down, no?\" Yegveny was standing over her seat, coming over from the delegation of PSD members.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it right now. I never thought we would get behind her policies like that, even if it's for the good of the Republic...\"\n\nYevgeny sat down beside her, and much like how she confided in him, he began to confide in her. \"I would've done the exact same you were doing right now if Morozov was Stalina. I know you're reluctant to vote for someone you disagree with. She may be the Woman of Steel, and she may not be the most liberal, but we have to remember that we're in this together. You won't be a deviant for bending your values a bit, especially if it's only for now. The PSD and DSNP will all go together to the polls, and we don't want the SMR to have doubts.

Are you really willing to put your own partisan politics over the sanctity of our democratic process and protection of it from subverters?\" In a heated assembly meeting, many members of the PSD, including a very vocal Yegveny, are furious about the recent direction the government has taken. To them, Stalina was a woman of steel, with a plan of iron and a will of titanium. Now, she and her party were embarrassed and sidelined. Voznesensky's harsh dismissal of her plan has caused more harm than good, it seems.\n\nThe PSD is fracturing the democratic Center. While all members of the PSD seemed to agree with Yevgeny's talking points, other democratic members of the assembly simply watched in shock. Jeers from the right and left energized their own platforms; further lowering the morale of the Center. When all hope seemed to be lost, a single voice was raised in the assembly.\n\n\"Yevgeny, you promised to help us... what are you going to do now? We said we would defend democracy together!\" Elena, almost on the verge of a breakdown, stood up valiantly and finally had the courage to confront her friendly rival on the Assembly floor.\n\nAfter silence and a sigh, he finally spoke. \"I'm going to accept the results of the election, regardless. I have no faith in a system that sidelines their own allies for meaningless favors.\" With his statement, the Center remained quiet. The roar of celebration from the other sides, however..."

I'm more partial to the use of colleague, but go off, I suppose.\"\n\nThe two share a brief laugh, before continuing to walk to their homes. \"Not everyone will be happy when it comes time to cast our ballots, that's for sure. But, at the same time, I'm okay with it. And hopefully you are too.\" Elena nodded.\n\n\"You know, I never understood Stalina's fascination with paternalism. Could you explain it again?\" Once again, the two of them were locked in a fierce, but friendly debate, one that would continue until they reached their homes. Regardless, when they parted ways, they were both accepting of the overall motions that the political system was going through.

 komi_friendship.20.d: "They woke up with bags around their head, and their hands tied with rope. All they felt was the tight grasp of somebody escorting them, and then forcing them to their knees. Elena and Yevgeny breathed heavily, as other people were forced to sit around them. The crackle of flames were present around them. What exactly happened? Their heads hurt, their hands were weary, and they felt that something was incredibly, incredibly amiss.\n\nWith a motion of one of the commissars, all of the bags were removed. Elena and Yevgeny looked around them, seeing fellow members of the Center, tied up with them as prisoners. Communist partisans and soldiers were armed, rounding up members of the democratic opposition. \"Listen closely! Everyone here is considered a traitor to the Komi Provisional Soviet. You will now be tried against a People's Commissariat for crimes against our glorious revolution. How do you plead?\"\n\n\"Not Guilty!\" Elena and Yevgeny shouted in unison. Deep down, they held onto some youthful hope that they had a chance. However, as the trial went on, as the commissars spoke, and as several assemblymen were taken away around them, it became clear that this was a show trial. This was the end. Meaningless words, piercing their defenses like tank shells, rallying the super-partisan council of judges assembled against them. They would certainly meet their deaths. However the communists decided to do it, however, was what occupied their minds.\n\n\"What are you going to do to us? We did nothing wro--\"\n\n\"GUILTY! Let them hang alongside their collaborationist brethren.\"\n\nDespite their cries, despite their physical resistance, this was the end. Elena and Yevgeny, with the strike of a gavel, now had their necks wrought around a noose. They had failed. Despite all of their promises, their work would be for naught with the simple collapse of a platform. Tears escaped Yevgeny's eyes. Elena remained silent. Both of them composed themselves, with a final exhale, before their lives were taken from them as swiftly as the floor below them dropped."

 komi_friendship.21.d: "「ごめんなさい」\n\nエレナの口から漏れたのはその言葉だけだった。周囲では、隠れ家が燃えていた。自由への最後の、絶望的な試みは失敗したのだ。右派の準軍事組織が、難民となる人々を守る最後の守備隊に勝利していたのだ。廊下は銃声、叫び声、木の割れ目で満たされていた。彼らが愛したもの、そのために戦ったものすべてが、ついに彼らの目の前で骨抜きにされたのだ。善良な男たちは、これを防ぐために死んだ。悪人は、それを灰に変えてしまった。\n\nエフゲニーは大きく咳き込んだ。肺に流れ弾が当ったのだ。「まさか、ここで死ぬとは……」古ぼけたレコード室で、かつて敵の一人だった人がそばにいて、テーブルを背にうつぶせになりながら。地面に置かれた拳銃は、体内の空気と同じように空っぽだった。もしかしたら、まだ弾丸が残っていれば、戦えるかもしれない。最後の、解放のための必死の爪痕を残して。もしかしたら、人生を終わらせることができるかもしれない。ファシストが彼らにすることは、きっと死よりもひどいことだろう。\n\n「我々は約束した……そして失敗した」\n\nエフゲニーが死にかけた時、録音室のドアが蹴られて開いた。ファシストの準軍隊員が、PPShに弾丸を込め、掃射した。部屋を一通り見渡した後、犠牲者たちを見下ろす。あの時、彼らが誰であったとしても、今は関係ない。ロシアは彼らなしで前に進んでいくのだ。そう言って、兵士は周りの煙を避けるように頭を低くして出ていった。"

The President gave a heartfelt, rallying speech outside the Assembly early this morning. No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the Center has survived the impossible. Democracy has survived a dangerous trial, and has emerged stronger than ever before.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sit on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side. Perhaps a bit unprofessional, but for the occasion? It was worth a potential hangover and scolding. \"Just like that day in the bar, huh?\" Yevgeny jokes casually.\n\n\"Your face isn't as red. Although, perhaps we may need more spirits to deal with the previous chaos.\" Elena suggests. The two share one genuine, hearty laugh. The sun is waking up by this point, with the dim glow of Syktyvkar's surviving street lamps fading away to make way for the light. Yet, there is brightness abound, and plenty of rebuilding to be done.\n\nElena and Yevgeny stand up, facing the city around them. The Republic was safe, and this was an effort helped by them. Every hour, every drop of sweat, and every inch of ground held led to eternal peace. It was worth it, for all of them. For all of us.\n\n\"So... friends? Or are we back to foes across the aisle?\"\n\n\"Friends. Without people like you, even if you are not entirely with me, matter. We promised, after all.\" The two nod, and shake hands. As they begin to head home, they only wish for a better tomorrow, one with the wounds of the past long gone."

 komi_friendship.23.d: "Syktyvkar was breathing again. Soldiers were putting down the last fringes of extremist resistance. Locals were rebuilding from the fighting. Stalina was giving a national radio broadcast, denouncing the actions of the past few weeks. No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the efforts of the PSD's reconstruction government have triumphed over all opposing forces. Stability would no longer be a word foreign to any citizen of Komi.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sat on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side.

Yegveny nodded. \"I can do that.\"\n\nKomi was once again safe, now under the paternal grip of Stalina to guide the nation. As the two began to walk home, Elena turned back to Yevgeny, but his eyes stayed the course forward. Despite their victory, she felt like something was lost.

 POLITICS_KPK_PRESIDIUM_DESC: "The collectively supreme body of the Soviet Republic, the Presidium represents a true socialist government as determined by the people, and is now able to exert its authority over the territory of the new state.\n\nComprising representatives from all facets of the Republic's political landscape, including reformists, leftists, pillars of orthodoxy, as well as many more marginal and esoteric factions besides, it is understood, through formal interdiction, that outright factionalism of any type is strictly prohibited. Despite this, however, internal intrigue abounds relentlessly.\n\nInformal coalitions - and the quick establishment and fragmentation of them - are constant as the Republic develops official policy and progresses forward. Though there are many figures of note to name, none can say with certainty which, if any, of them command enough support, overt or otherwise, to shape its general consensus."
 POLITICS_FAS_COALITION_DESC: "Hastily organized in the aftermath of radical action, the Passionariyy Society has assumed power within the state in order to protect both it and the people from the destructive forces of unchecked democracy, socialism, and subversion of all types.\n\nA loose affiliation of many rightist groups dedicated to order and progress within Komi, the Society as a whole is nevertheless dominated by the leaders of its most powerful factions - Igor Shafarevich, Lev Gumilyov, Ivan Serov, and Sergey Taboritsky - who act collectively, in committee fashion, to develop and dictate government policy.\n\nThough united in general purpose for now, it is well-understood that this power-sharing arrangement, and even the Society as a whole, is not likely to endure. Each faction possesses very different opinions on the direction of the new state following its stabilization, and it is unknown who, if any, will be able to convince their contemporaries of the superiority of that vision - or if it will need to be imposed by force."

 KOM_the_last_years_of_the_voznesentsi_desc: "我々連立与党は、ニコライ・ヴォズネセンスキー率いる民主主義派閥の左派である「ヴォズネセンスキー派」によって率いられている。彼らの指導の下でコミは、爆撃からの復興、死者の減少、そして難民を我々の町や都市に移住させることなどの大きな改善を行った。しかしすべてが順調というわけでもない。ヴォズネセンスキーは極左、特にアンドレイ・ジダーノフとの結びつきが極めて顕著であひ、連立政権の中の保守的なメンバーたちは彼に不信感を募らせている。\n\nヴォズネセンスキーが党首の座を維持できるのか、それとも別の派閥がその座につくのか、それはまだわからない。"
 KOM_speak_with_stalina_desc: "ソ連の有名な官僚ヨシフ・スターリンの娘であるスヴェトラーナ・スターリナは過激主義を抑える効果的な方法を編み出す上で、最も貴重な人材の一人である。彼女の計画は、しばしば冷酷で目的のためなら手段を選ばないが、概して優れており、ライバルたちの絶え間ない策略をうまく阻止している。\n\n彼女の忠誠心を維持し、彼女の影響力をより大きくするために党を開放することは、我々の覇権を維持する重要な方法であると多くの人が考えている。より原理主義的な民主主義者は、彼女の権威主義的傾向に不満を抱いているが、彼女に接近することは我々の助けにしかならないはずだ。"
 KOM_our_paramilitaries_reports_desc: "我が準軍事組織の司令官ペトロ・グリゴレンコから、最新の監視結果が直接届いた。これまでの報告は、我々にコミ共和国の重要な道路を支配する能力に関する大きな自信を与えてくれなかったが、今回の報告も同様であった。\n\nスースロフとグミリョフの配下の準軍事組織がますます街中で行進するようになり、倉庫や投票所、さらにはスィクトフィカル近隣の全地区を支配するに至っている。一方、我々の軍隊は、民主主義を支持する地区の支配と、我々に残されたものを守る能力のどちらにおいても、弱体化し衰退している。コミの一般市民が民主主義にダメージを与える過激派に取り込まれる前に、我々は今、この事態に対して何かをしなければならない。"
 KOM_the_government_in_check_desc: "我々の政権のあらゆる部分が、ある意味で危険に晒されている。我々が手をこまねいている間に、左翼と右翼の両方が、我々から妨害を受けることなく陰謀を企てて、計算し、行動を起こしてきたのである。\n\n我々は本質的に2枚のルークを脇に従えるキングなのだ。我々に許された行動は限られており、正しい手を打たねばならない。一手でも間違いを犯せば、我々はゲームオーバーなのだ。コミの民主主義の炎を絶やさないための計画を再確認し大急ぎで改良しなければならない。共和国の運命は、それにかかっている。"
 KOM_eyes_to_the_left_desc: "グミリョフはコミの政治という複雑な宮廷劇において小さな害虫に過ぎず、我々は彼よりはるかに大きな脅威に対処しなければならない。それは操り人形師スースロフとその取り巻きに率いられた急進的左翼である。街頭は彼の準軍事組織によって占拠され、彼への世論支持は徐々に増加しており、我々は政治的スペクトルのこちら側に対処しなくてはならないのだ。\n\n彼らに対抗するために、我々は民主主義のスースロフにならなければならない。我が政府の監視の目は共産党の手先を見失ってはならない。やがて陰謀を企む極左指導者たちは、彼らを倒そうとする我々の計画に立ち向かわなければならなくなるだろう。"
 KOM_observe_leftist_paramilitaries_desc: "我が国では、準軍事的組織が堂々と通りを行進することがもはや日常となっている。準軍事組織は、我々を含むすべての政党の生命線であり、見えざる手である。そして少しでも分別のある策士は皆それを知っている。\n\n共和国において準軍事組織の地位と重要性が高いため、彼らの凶悪犯の言動を単に監視するだけで、彼らの計画に関する貴重な情報を得ることができる。諜報員や市民の観察によって、我々は敵がいつどこにいるのかを時間ごとに把握することができるのだ。"
 KOM_the_spreading_red_influence_desc: "ありふれたレストランでの会話から投票所まで、話や場所が赤と金や鎌と槌の色合いを帯び始めている。このままではもはや極左ではなく、徐々に一般市民もそれらを肯定的に語るようになるだろう。\n\n共産主義的、社会主義的プロパガンダの流布は、我々の準軍事組織を通じて止めなければならず、市民向けの我々独自の情報が代わりに流布することになる。投票所の警備を強化し、疑わしい市民には左翼的な活動がないかをチェックする。我々は彼らの努力をここで止めなければならない。"
 KOM_the_strike_from_the_right_desc: "右翼は左翼の脅威を打ち負かすのに手を貸してくれるとしても、右翼における状況は我々に有利に展開していないようだ。\n\n我々が共産主義者の脅威に対処している間に、ファシストたちはこの機会を利用して、その影響力と規模を拡大したようだ。左翼と同様に、政治的な落書きや有権者の脅迫、グミリョフの準軍事的襲撃などの話が我々の政治圏に広がっており、いつまでも止まる気配がない。我々は会議を招集してこの新たな脅威に対処する計画を立案し、実行に移さなければならない。"

 KOM_eyes_straight_ahead_desc: "どちらか一方に「より大きな悪」というレッテルを張るのは魅力的かもしれない。しかし彼らはどちらも民主主義に対する脅威であり、一方に対処すれば他方が強化されるだけというのが我々の信念である。\n\n真の解決策は他者を攻撃することではなく、自らを守ることである。それで民主主義は機能することができる。必要なのは我々を苦しめている問題を解決しようとする我々政府の意志と、過激な侵略に抵抗する人々の意志だけだ。この2つを刺激することで、我々の生存の多大な助けとなり、共和国が人々のために存在し続けることが可能になる。"
 KOM_distance_from_zhdanov_desc: "我が政権の不安材料は、我が指導者である同志ヴォズネセンスキーとその交友関係にまつわる噂である。伝えられるところでは、ヴォズネセンスキーは極左のアンドレイ・ジダーノフと個人的な親交があるらしい。\n\n我々は、この噂を我々を分断しようとするスースロフ派の陰謀だと信じているとはいえ、やはりこの噂はとても気掛かりだし、そしてもちろん火のないところから煙は立たないのである。念のため、同志ヴォズネセンスキーに対してジダーノフとの関係を断ち、彼の政党や行動全般から距離を置くよう懇願するのが最善であろう。"
 KOM_reinforce_the_center_desc: "「同志諸君、共和国の希望は過激派の邪悪な嘘にあるわけではないことを忘れるな。そのような虚は、我々の統治に自信のない者を誘惑したり、罠にはめたりすることや、市民を洗脳して過激派の目的に奉仕させるためにあるのだ！このような嘘に対する解決策は、持ちこたえることだ。これ以上スースロフやグミリョフに市民を奪われることがあってはならない！」\n\n議員に対するスターリナの演説は、過激派に対抗する我々の計画の概要を表している。中道政権は維持されなければならない。そのためには、中道を守り、他者が極左や極右の手に落ちないように我々はあらゆる努力をしなければならない。"
 KOM_the_face_of_the_movement_desc: "スヴェトラーナ・スターリナ：資産家、演説家、闘士。\n\nスターリナは最近共和国の炎を維持するためにますます重要な人物となっており、コミの市民の間で急速に知名度と名声を高めている。熱心な反革命主義者である彼女の演説と行動は、スィクティフカルやその他の地域の敵の脅威に直接立ち向かうものであり、多くの人々を我々の民主主義思想に駆り立てる。今我々は、過激派を踏みつぶすためにこれまで以上に彼女を必要とすることになる。"
 KOM_let_them_burn_themselves_out_desc: "敵の敵は味方、とはよくいったものである。もちろん実際には彼らはいわゆる友人ではないが、共和国を強固にするための非常に便利な道具なのだ。\n\n左翼と右翼は民主主義を嫌っている。これは事実だが、彼らにとって民主主義よりも邪悪ものが存在しており、それはどんな時でも戦うべき致命的な敵であると宣言している。その敵とは右翼と左翼のお互いである。現在でも彼らの準軍事組織は街頭で戦っており、スィクティフカルや共和国全体の思想的優位性を獲得しようと努めている。もちろんこれらの戦いの勝者が消耗しきっていれば……彼らは我々に対して戦いを挑むこともないだろう。"
 KOM_eyes_to_the_right_desc: "影は共和国の至る所に潜んでいる。彼らの闇はスィクティフカルの地面の下に隠れ、待ち続け、機を窺って攻撃を企てている。\n\nこれらの影はコミの右翼準軍事組織の指導者であるレフ・グミリョフの手先に他ならず、おそらくはこれには政治家も含まれている。左翼とは交渉の余地があるが、グミリョフの陰謀は我々が破滅するまで止まらないだろう。我々は右翼に焦点を当てて、彼らを打倒しなければならない。まずは彼らの監視から始めよう。"
 KOM_armed_activities_desc: "コミの右翼準軍事組織はその意図と武装にほとんど遠慮がないことでよく知られている。彼らは街中だろうが、パイプや短剣、さらにはピストルやライフル銃を持って行進し、声を上げたり立ち向かおうとした人たちを威嚇している。\n\nしかしグミリョフの狂気には法則性がある。規則性を把握し、場所を記録し、行動を記録することで、グミリョフが知られたくないであろう情報を得ることができる。それは我々に利する。"
 KOM_the_extent_of_the_shadow_desc: "グミリョフが極右の総指揮官であることは政府内で意見が一致しているが、それ以外の点ではあまり一致していない。グミリョフの得意技は人脈を歪曲して隠ぺいすることであるため、共和国やその機関にどれだけの影響力が彼にあるのかを判断することは不可能に近いものがある。グミリョフを倒すには、まずグミリョフの隠れ場所を明らかにしなければならない。我々の監視と調査によって、右翼の操り人形師はついにその手先を日に晒すことになるのだ。"
 KOM_the_strike_from_the_left_desc: "路地の壁に赤い星が粗雑に吹き付けられている。赤と金の旗が宙にはためき、近所の家々に少しの間だけにせよ掲げられた。丘には目があり、壁には耳がある。そしてそれらの器官すべてスースロフのものだ。\n\nグミリョフや右翼に対する我々の活動が始まって以来、コミの街角における共産主義者の活動が急増している。この機会を捉えて我々の盲点を突いて、彼らは右翼に対する独自のキャンペーンを開始して、永久に彼らを終わらせようとしているのだ。これは表面的には我々にとって良いことであるが、グミリョフが永久にいなくなったとき、左翼は新たな標的を選ぶであろう。強力で影響力のある赤軍の不意打ちを食らう前に、我々はこのシナリオに備えて計画を立てなければならない。"
 KOM_believe_in_svetlana_desc: "グミリョフを倒せるかもしれない唯一の政治家であるスヴェトラーナ・スターリナは、ひょっとすると過激派との戦いにおいて最も重要な戦力の1つかもしれない。彼女の演説は政治家を鼓舞するだけでなく、支持者の士気を高め、国のために戦う意欲さえさらに高めている。\n\nスヴェトラーナとは前進する道であり、もし我々が右翼（と左翼）を粉砕しコミに秩序をもたらせたならば、彼女が民主主義の松明と民意の炎を担わなければならない。我々は彼女に全幅の信頼を寄せているのだ。彼女の例に倣って共和国を永久に安定させられるかは、我々次第だ。"
 KOM_the_interlude_desc: "一時的とはいえ、ようやくまた落ち着きを取り戻せたようだ。陰謀を企てる者たちはおそらくは暗闇の中で陰謀を続けるために、再び人目を避けるようになった。街道は平穏になり、議会の混乱もどんどん少なくなっていった。\n\nしかしこの静けさには理由がある。まもなくコミ共和国全土で行われる選挙で、再び民主主義が試されるのだ。自分たちの指導者を政権に就けることを望む各派閥は、現在国民の支持と地域の準軍事的支配力を計算しながら、計画を立てて足場を固めなければならない。運動の時は終わった。戦略を練る時が始まる。"

 KOM_election_day_preparations_desc: "選挙は、もし過激派が簡単だと思っていたとしても、即座に実施できるものではない。投票所の準備やチラシの送付、投票所の設営などの議員を飽きさせるほど果てしないお決まりの作業をこれから始めなければならない。\n\nいつものように、民主主義への義務を果たし、これらの作業を行うために準備の整ったボランティアを呼び集めよう。そしてもちろんこのすべての作業において、我々は過激派にも注意しなければならない。彼らの考える「準備」とは、もっと邪悪なものだからだ……"
 KOM_ensure_internal_stability_desc: "ここ数日我が党は、議員間で時に些細なことをめぐって議論が白熱したり、党員間で派閥意識の高まったりや協力を拒否したりなど、ある部分で「混乱」していると報じられている。これまでは「意見・表現の自由」という加害者側の弁明のもとで許されてきたが、今度の選挙はコミ史上最も重要な選挙の一つであり、民主主義的政党はこれ以上この問題を許容することはできない。\n\n明確な方法を通じて我々は、全員がちゃんと座って静かにさせる。一つの党として団結する。もはや議場が演説のたびに議論に明け暮れることも、派閥の間の亀裂を容認することもないだろう。我々はともに一体となる。過激派もまた一体となるであろうから、我々は一体とならなければならないのだ。"
 KOM_calculate_the_bombing_intervals_desc: "毎週毎週ナチスの野郎どもがロシアの人々に爆弾の雨を降らせるたびに、地獄のような終末が我が国土に現れる。毎日新しい孤児が生まれるし、特に火曜日のあと数日間病院は満杯になる。なぜならすべての孤児がやってくる日だからだ。\n\nドイツ人は邪悪であると同時に予測可能である。特定の日の特定の時間に、爆弾が他の時よりも多く降り注ぐのは偶然ではないし、国防軍がコーヒーブレイクの時間を他の時ではなく、特定の日と時間に楽しもうとするのも偶然ではない。彼らは我々の「小さな」民主主義を止めることはできないだろう。ちょっとした計算があれば、もはや選挙を邪魔するものが空からやってくることはないのだ。"
 KOM_protect_the_people_desc: "人は家では、室内だろうが屋外だろうが常に安心・安全であるべきである。盗賊や暴漢はあえて都市部に侵入してくることはないが、地方では思う存分強盗や殺戮を繰り返すために徘徊していることで知られている。さらにドイツ軍の爆撃は常に犠牲者を出し続けており、不幸にもその卑劣な兵器の着弾点の近くにいた者は皆吹き飛ばされてしまう。\n\n生存といった他のことに忙殺されては、人々は投票できない。従って我々は、地方から盗賊を一掃したり、外部からの襲撃から国境を守ったり、空襲から自分たちを守ったりするための計画に着手しなければならない。そうしてのみ、民主主義は花開くのだ。"
 KOM_watch_the_radicals_desc: "過激派は民主主義のプロセスを信じたことがない。たとえ彼らが信じていると自称していたとしてもだ。選挙が近づいてきているここ数日間彼らはどちらかといえば静かだったが、いつ影から姿を現すかわからないのが常である。右翼左翼のどちらの陰謀の名人もまだエースを隠し持っており、その隠し玉が何なのかも分からない。\n\n準軍事組織の監視は必要であり、左翼的な活動も右翼的な活動もすべて発見され摘発されることになる。彼らがやりたがっている「おかしな手口」があれば、我々は把握するだろう。そして反撃するのだ。"
 KOM_something_wicked_this_way_comes_desc: "数ヶ月に及ぶ厳しい準備。選挙戦の日々。楽しむもよし、怖がるもよし、参加するもよし、逃げるもよし。選挙は誰に対しても等しくやってくる。\n\n今、民主主義の試練とそれに伴う統治が始まる。この選挙のために我々が行ってきた一つ一つの準備が、今実を結ぶか、あるいは我々を失望させるか決まる。この重要な選挙が我々の運命や未来を決定するのだ。我々の可能性を疑う人もいれば、我々の死を願う人もいるが、しかし何が起ころうとも最後には必ず民主主義が勝利する。"

 KOM_the_affairs_of_the_legislature_desc: "我が共和国の批判者は過剰な政治的陰謀や時折起こる暴力を指摘するものの、コミには策略や陰謀以上のものが存在する。国民議会の政策は、他のものと同様に激しく争われる一方で、毎年政府の陰謀の影響を受ける何千人もの人々にとって重要な要素である。今年も国民議会を開いて新しい党の院内総務を任命し、すべての機関が通常通り機能するようにすることで、共和国の組織がこれまでと同程度機能することを保証できる。\n\nさらに、これにより我々は長い歴史を持つ法律を改正したり、多くの共和国国民の生活を向上させたりして、前例と伝統を断ち切る機会を得なければならない。国民に支えられた国家権力の巧みな行使により、あらゆることが可能になる。"
 KOM_bill_the_1962_budget_desc: "1962年度共和国予算は、コミ政府が管理する各計画への予算割当を網羅した重要な文書である。しかし連立与党が国会を支配しているとはいえ、予算案の成立が完全に保証されているわけではない。歴史的に見ても、連立政権内の各政党は何に予算をつけるべきかについて異なる考えを持っているため、予算の通過には妥協が必要である。\n\nそのため予算は、各議員に忠誠を誓わせるために彼らの個人的な計画に予算を割り当てる、利益誘導の実線の場になってきた。しかしヴォズネセンスキー大統領の不人気さが増していることもあって、国民議会は通常の手口では収拾がつかなくなる可能性がある。大統領の多くの顧問や味方が、政府を味方につける通常の方法は今期はあまり効果がなく、共和国が必要とする予算を確保するためには別の手段が必要になるかもしれないと助言している。"
 KOM_bill_the_infrastructure_repair_bill_desc: "共和国にはインフラの補修や破損した水上バイクや輸送車両の交換などを行う交通局が存在するが、ここからは現在直面しているあらゆる問題に対処するには予算が不足しているとの不満が絶えず寄せられている。このたび、具体的に交通局のインフラ補修部門を支援するための特別予算案が国民議会に提出された。\n\nしかし、この法案には例えば労働法制や具体的な資金源などの未確定な部分がある。これらの事項は法案の成立前に国民議会で決定しなければならない。"
 KOM_bill_the_mandated_minority_representation_bill_desc: "我が共和国には、国民議会内の不平等という深く憂慮すべき傾向がある。議員の大多数はロシア人であり、共和国の名を冠した姻族であるコミ族は国民議会の極少数のみしかを占めていないのである。スヴェトラーナ・スターリナのPSDが提出したこの法案は、新たな選挙区を設定することでマイノリティの代表者を一定の割合で選出して、より多くのマイノリティを国会に送り込み、コミ族の豊かな文化を代表権の欠如から守ることができるようにことを主張している。\n\n珍しくスターリナと左翼はこの問題で足並みを揃えており、ヴォズネセンスキーやPSD、共産主義者の大部分はこの法案を支持している。法案の行方は、残りの集団が支持するか反対するかにかかっていると思われる。より穏健的な法案であれば、指定代表者制の政治的影響を懸念する中道派からより多くの支持を得ることができ、左翼の影響を減らすことができるかもしれない。"
 KOM_bill_the_defense_of_the_republic_bill_desc: "コミ共和国軍はロシアの荒れ地では強力な戦力だが、しかし問題を抱えている。具体的には規模の小ささだ。我が国の人口が少なく、国勢調査が必ずしも効率的でないため、軍は現在の徴兵制度では必要なだけの人的資源を十分に確保できていないのだ。この問題を解決して敵対的隣人から共和国を守るために、いくつかの解決策が国民議会で提案されている。\n\n連立与党の公式方針は徴兵期間を1年から2年に延長することだが、左派はそれに加えて特定の政治団体に参加していることを理由に兵役への志願を禁止している法律を緩和することを提案している。これは思い切った措置だが、共和国が必要な人員を確保するのに役立つ可能性がある。解決策はいつも通り国民議会で決定される。"
 KOM_bill_the_equal_zoning_bill_desc: "選挙区割りは、公民権を持たない街の周辺に住む難民から再選を目指す政治家まで、共和国の多くの人々に長い間影響を与えてきた問題である。特にコミとスィクティフカルでは、爆撃と難民による大量の人口移動と正確な国勢調査を行うためのリソース不足のために、この選挙区割りは悪名高いほど困難になっている。\n\nこのため、帳簿をあまり改竄することなく、どんなデタラメな人口分布だろうとでっちあげて公的記録に見せかけることができる環境が自然と整っているのだ。大統領は選挙区割りを担当する委員会の何人かの議員と内密に話をした。特定の政治家に便宜を図って彼らの選挙区を揺るぎないものにすることは、彼らが政府の取り組みにもっと支持するようにするために必要な「動機付け」なのかもしれない。"
 KOM_bill_the_municipal_pacification_bill_desc: "広範にわたる暴力は時間の経過とともに上昇しており、準軍事組織の状況は完全に制御不能になりつつあると言われている。国民議会の一部議員は、民主主義の中道派閥の中心人物であるスヴェトラーナ・スタリーナやイヴァン・モロゾフを筆頭に、共和国の「問題地域」内での警察の権限をブハーリン時代以来見られなかったレベルまで引き上げるというかなり思い切った法案を提出している。国民議会の多くの政治家はこの法案を、政府の専制的な越権行為であり、現在の与党に対する政治的反対を露骨に封じ込めようとするものだとして非難しているが、ある者は、この反対はこれらの政治家の不正な支援源が根絶されることを防ごうとしているだけだという見方もできると主張している。好むと好まざるとにかかわらず、この法案は採決され、民主的な手続きに委ねられることになる。"

 KOM_ccoup_democrats_coup_desc: "When the Republic was founded, it was the goal of the governing parties to keep violence out of Komi's political system. Though noble, this goal was a terrible failure in practice, to the point that the defenders of democracy have had to use the same weapon as its enemies: a military coup.\n\nNow that Komi's democracy has been saved from the brink of death, it is the military's responsibility to safeguard it, lest it be lost again and irreversibly. We must be ever vigilant; never again can extremism be allowed to threaten our liberties. Only after we have weathered the storm can the Republic return to a situation approaching normal."
 KOM_ccoup_defend_democracy_desc: "It was nearly lost, but the people of Komi have retaken their democracy from the clutches of an extremist putsch. The Republic is restored, but this may all be for naught if the same forces who nearly destroyed it rebuild their efforts. It is for this reason that we must remain vigilant, and extend our wariness of authoritarianism to the public.\n\nThe people, turned skeptical by recent turbulence, must be reminded to love democracy. Media campaigns against extremism of both the right and the left and a hunt for the anti-democratic forces in our midst are a must if we want to fully restore confidence in the liberal system."
 KOM_ccoup_expel_the_radicals_desc: "While the political leadership stakes out its course, most of the day-to-day runnings of the Republic is handled by the bureaucracy, the police and the army. We must ensure these vital institutions can't be subverted by radicals. We will thoroughly vet our institutions and get rid of everyone with dangerous radical sympathies."
 KOM_ccoup_every_last_resource_desc: "We are at a precipice. Our beloved republic is at real threat of being destroyed by subversive forces. To save it, we must be prepared to throw everything we have into the struggle. All our resources and materiel must be put to use. Every last rouble invested. Every loyal citizen must be mobilized. We can't afford to keep anything in reserve. For the good of the Republic!"
 KOM_ccoup_emergency_rule_desc: "The greatest triumph of our Republic has been to end arbitrary \"frontier justice\" and give its people a dependable, predictable justice system to protect their rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, the radicals still have sympathizers in our society, sympathizers who will abuse these freedoms to obstruct our efforts to restabilize the Republic. We are forced to suspend, for the time being, some of our most cherished rights. The radicals have given us no other option."
 KOM_ccoup_restore_order_desc: "The Republican Army failed in its duty when it allowed our Republic to fall to radical forces. While loyal officers have been vital in striking back, our forces are still scattered and demoralized. This state of affairs can't be allowed to continue. Our enemies are rallying their forces, and the struggle for our home is far from over. We need our army back.\n\nWe must rally our soldiers. We must remind them of their duty. The army will restore its honor by crushing the nascent insurgency."
 KOM_ccoup_our_loyal_sympathizers_desc: "A large majority of our citizens support the Republic and believe in its founding principles. Recent events have shown, however, that this majority is prone to inaction in the face of attacks by internal, radical forces. We must restore their confidence and teach them principles and tactics of resistance and mass action, so that they will resist attempts to subvert their rights and freedoms and do their part to defend the Republic in the future."
 KOM_ccoup_paralyze_the_paramilitaries_desc: "Several political movements have organized their membership into paramilitaries. Previously tolerated to maintain stability, it is now abundantly clear the practice needs to end. The coup-makers leaned heavily on their armed support, but even the notionally loyal groupings proved unreliable, acting more as agents of chaos than allies. We will issue a demand for all such groupings to stand down and demobilize permanently. Paramilitaries which refuse will be subject to arrests and forced disarmament. Peace in the Republic requires it."
 KOM_ccoup_restore_the_quiet_desc: "The recent instability and fighting in the Republic has wreaked havoc on the economy and the day-to-day rhythm of civilian life. While we are now in the process of restoring control, this has not yet been felt by the populace. That needs to change. We will keep the streets safe for the people. We will reopen schools, markets and shops. They will see that life is returning to normal, and hopefully, it will restore their faith in our leadership."
 KOM_ccoup_komi_belongs_to_the_citizens_desc: "The recent instability has been a dark time in our short history. Our rights and freedoms came under attack, and the Republic itself came very close to falling. Insurgents were in the streets, visiting their thuggery on an undefended people. We were at the precipice of something truly dark.\n\nThrough immense effort, we have made it back. All over the Republic, brave men and women have fought for the rights and freedoms we all hold dear. We have fought, and we have overcome. The enemy has been defeated, and moderate forces are now firmly back in control. We have won."

 KOM_unstable_victory_a_victory_for_democracy_desc: "After counting every vote, it turns out that the democrats have received a plurality of the vote!\n\nEven more surprising to Komi's citizens, it seems that the moderates have decided to go at it alone. Without a clear majority of the delegates, the resulting government is destined to be an extremely weak one. Yet the parties of the center left to center right have decided to gamble that neither the far left nor the far right will dare to cause a vote of no-confidence so soon after elections. Perhaps the far left and far right militias will give the government at least a month to live?"
 KOM_unstable_victory_secure_the_republic_desc: "Barring some unfortunate extralegal violence by paramilitaries, the biggest threat to the new coalition government is a simple vote of no-confidence by fascist or communist deputies. The new government's first order of business is thus to spend every scrap of influence and diplomacy to gather enough confidence and supply agreements to stay afloat for the year. By guaranteeing that the government will not fall while trying to pass a budget, the moderate coalition hopes to gain some time."
 KOM_unstable_victory_a_standing_coalition_desc: "Even with the vaguest assurances that the government is free from outside pressure, internal pressure within the coalition also need to be kept in check. When living life on the thinnest of political edges, a single deputy defecting could have disastrous consequences on the government. And so, a generous amount of ministries and positions have to be doled to every coalition partner, with the biggest political party keeping a few choice offices for themselves."
 KOM_unstable_victory_the_defense_plan_desc: "The democratic coalition would not trust the fascist and communist with a bucket of warm piss, let alone believe their empty platitudes about respecting the minority government for at least a year. As such, extra precautions are being taken to make sure every single member of the government is free from extreme ideology. Equally important is being absolutely certain that no one in the coalition can be blackmailed, lest the ensuing consequences be disastrous."
 KOM_unstable_victory_stalinas_speech_desc: "Among the moderate coalition's few blessing is the backing of Svetlana Stalina. The charismatic woman is popular both within the democratic factions and without, throughout Komi's electorate. By having her go on a public offensive against the communists and fascists, some very needed breathing room could be created for the democratic faction. Stalina is already well known for disliking the ideologues and fanatics that impede Komi's progress. Yet, some within the government worry about rumors of the young woman's ambition. Many worry that her honeyed words might in the end poison the young republic. In the short term, however, the coalition must play all of its cards."
 KOM_unstable_victory_direct_action_desc: "Left unsaid in the communists' and fascists' pledges not to overthrow the government democratically is the danger posed by their paramilitaries. What's a little coup, between friends?\n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe, a small cabal of coalition officials have begun to cook up some extra-legal defense of the Republic. The communists and fascists fear one another more than they fear the weak minority government. Their surprise at seeing the benchwarmers lash out might be just what the coalition needs to survive."
 KOM_unstable_victory_acquire_the_information_desc: "As the fascists and communists plot each other's destruction, the coalition government's secret security committee has begun to ramp up its intelligence work. Suslov and Gumilyov are slippery eels, yet many of their subordinates fail to live up to their bosses' secrecy. By bribing small time agents of both sides, a sizable pot of information can be built up on both factions. Speed is of the essence, as is a simultaneous strike at both sides."
 KOM_unstable_victory_surround_the_neighborhoods_desc: "To a casual observer, it might seem that Komi's Republican Army is completely compromised; its officer corps riddled with Suslovite plants, and many of its best regiments crewed by mercenaries of suspect loyalties. Yet legally speaking, the army's chain of command leads to the civilian government at all times.\n\nNow that the government has intel, army units have been arranged in crucial neighborhoods around the city. By moving rapidly, it's likely that neither side will have the time to use their army contacts before it's too late."
 KOM_unstable_victory_nip_it_in_the_bud_desc: "The tell tale sounds of guns and artillery slamming around various points in Komi has kept most of the city's inhabitants hiding indoors. Occasionally, some daredevil wanders out to look for information.\n\nThe shocked communists and fascists have been woken in the middle of the night by army troops. Both sets of paramilitaries are putting up a violent fight, their cause aided by turncoats within the army. No one knows if the government's gambit is likely to succeed or fail."
 KOM_unstable_victory_komi_is_strong_and_stable_desc: "Throngs of suspected fascist or communist sympathizers are being marched to various secure prisons around the city. Shock and dismay cloud the eyes of the defeated paramilitaries, woken in the middle of the night by the toothless coalition government and its soldiers.\n\nThe minority government has somehow succeeded in its mission to crush the far right and far left! Some might worry that the city's democracy will forever be stained by the violent crackdown. These men and women simply fail to see that for the first time since its foundation, Komi's republic is now strong and stable! No longer shall violence intimidate politicians of the nation!"

 KOM_RNP_election_the_national_democracy_act_desc: "最近共和国に対する暴力が増加し、国民議会へのテロ攻撃で数名の議員が死亡したため、我々は必要な行動を取るほかなくなった。シャファレヴィチは自身の地位とRNPが議会の多数派であることを利用して、共和国を過激派や準軍事組織から守るための新法、国家民主主義法を制定しなければならない。現状が維持できなくなりつつある今、我々は共和国を脅かそうとする者たちを打ち負かすために、断固とした態度で臨まなければならない。\n\nこの法律は野蛮な共産主義テロリストの手から民主主義を救い、コミの全市民の安全を確保するものである。報道や抗議の権利など、いくつか一時的な制限を設けられなければならないが、この法律は大統領とその内閣に与える権限により、これらの脅威に十分対処することができるようになる。"

 KOM_KPK_election_revolution_by_ballot_desc: "After the most contentious election process in Komi's history, our party stands victorious. The Communist Party candidate [KOM.GetLeader] has seized the presidency and thus reins of power. This is the vital first step in a socialist revolution that will seek to respect the rule of democracy, at least for now.\n\nAs the Communist Party attempts to empower labor and root out \"reaction\" in the Republic, we will have to grapple with the fact that our opponents consider us illegitimate and dangerously extremist. Some have reportedly even refused to attend sessions of the legislature. Nevertheless, our mandate is impossible to ignore; the other parties will have to learn to respect the Communist Party's wishes, whether through the easy way or the hard way."
 KOM_KPK_election_escalate_the_process_desc: "The Communist Party's quest for a socialist revolution through traditional legislative means is fraught with danger from a variety of enemies. Members of parties of the democratic center still entirely refuse to cooperate with us, and the reactionary right is naturally extremely hostile to our project. In the security apparatus, there is always the risk of military elements hostile to the revolution undermining us through force. It is for these reasons that we must hasten our transition to socialism.\n\nThe Party and its supporters need to be on a war footing. What this means in practice is a vigorous campaign against the enemies of the people, both through a propaganda offensive and through investigation of potential foes within the state. Our enemies are myriad and ferocious; if we are not on guard, we could easily be swept up in a merciless tide of reaction."
 KOM_KPK_election_collaboration_with_labour_desc: "The goal of the KPK has always been to restore the dictatorship of the proletariat in accordance with Leninist principles, and under the current circumstances this requires working with the trade unions. Unions are, of course, a temporary measure in the grand scheme of things, but for the moment they are the primary instrument of the will of the proletariat, and as such must be considered when drafting policy.\n\nWe shall begin drafting laws to delegate powers to the various trade unions, including and especially a policy of greater self-management, though the extent of this remains to be determined within the Party. By working with the unions, we will soon be able to demonstrate to the people that the bourgeois liberalism of the Republic must be abandoned if they wish to enjoy a better life."
 KOM_KPK_election_the_changing_of_the_guard_desc: "The upper echelons of any standing army are almost always in the service of reaction, as 1917 taught us. As such, we have always anticipated needing to move against the Army General Staff, but the revelation of Case October and its possible mobilization by the Republican Army has forced us to consider dealing with them sooner rather than later.\n\nDefense Minister Chelomei has been tasked with ensuring the stability of the Revolution against reactionary officers, and so far seems to have done well in this task. The chief conspirators have been isolated by firing or \"neutralizing\" key mid-ranking officers, and now all that remains is to remove these men from service. We will tolerate no counterrevolution from our army ever again."
 KOM_KPK_election_cast_down_the_passionarists_desc: "There remains one major threat left to deal with; the Passionariyy Organization. That collection of esoterics and crypto-fascists was left to fester by the liberals, and so, as ever, it falls to socialists to bring an end to the reactionary menace. Only we have ever had the courage, the will, and the ideological motivation to see these lunatics driven out of power, and now we have the means to do so.\n\nIf we are to save Russia, then we must remove the Passionariyy at once, by any means necessary. With our current power, we have numerous methods at our disposal; we could always ask the liberals to cooperate in removing what is clearly the larger threat, in the hope that they will see reason, or we could turn to more forceful means. One way or another, Gumilyov and his coterie are a den of vipers, and we must destroy them!"
 KOM_KPK_election_alliance_of_convenience_desc: "The left and center have an enormous number of differences on a variety of topics. We see them as complicit in the capitalist system; they see us as enemies of democracy. There is one point on which liberals and communists can always agree, however: keeping the far right from taking power is a top priority.\n\nOur makeshift anti-fascist coalition will mostly involve deputies of the DSNP, as the other parties of the center refuse to work with us under any circumstances. If we act quickly, we can cooperate to completely shut out the Passionariyy before they stand a chance of usurping the Republic."
 KOM_KPK_election_revolution_is_not_civilized_desc: "The time for restraint is over. The Passionariyy, with their extreme ideology and terroristic assaults on politicians of other parties, have proven themselves entirely incompatible with the values of the Republic or its people. For every day it exists as an independent political faction, Komi becomes less safe. The forces of reaction cannot be allowed to endanger us any longer; with our legislative majority, we have the power we need to stymie them forever.\n\nThe Communist Party and what remaining anti-fascist allies it has among the parties of the center will vote to declare the Passionariyy unconstitutional for Nazi sympathy and conspiracy against the Republic. The battle against the far-right will be far from over, but its power underground will be but a shadow of what it had before."
 KOM_KPK_election_the_popular_apportionment_act_desc: "The way we can best secure a transition from bourgeois capitalist democracy to the dictatorship of the proletariat is through a piece of legislation known as the Popular Apportionment Act, a bill that redraws the prior election districts. As these districts are designed to allow for participation in bourgeois democracy, they need to be redrawn in such a way that grants the KPK additional seats to ensure the Party is always able to maintain a plurality in the Assembly. In addition, it allows the President to dissolve the Assembly in order to allow additional time to prepare for upcoming elections.\n\nOur opponents may decry this as undemocratic, but true democracy can only occur once the bourgeoisie has been suppressed and power given to the workers, through the vanguard; we shouldn't expect them to understand. And if the Assembly refuses to pass the bill, then President [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] can use his emergency powers to implement it. One way or another, the death knell of Voznesensky's liberal perversion rings loud and clear."

Now that we govern West Russia and have transcended the simple borders of the old Komi Republic, it's time to hold the [KOM.GetName]'s first official elections. For many West Russians, this will be their first free election. They are excited to head to the polls.\n\nThree parties have thrown their hats into the ring: The democratic socialist §PDSNP§! headed by Nikolai Voznesensky, the centrist §MPSD§! under Svetlana Stalina, and the liberal §YSMR§! fielding Ivan Morozov. The [GetYear] elections are sure to be a close race, and whoever wins will decide the fate of West Russia for 4 more years. The race is on!"
 KOM_second_election_the_DSNP_campaign_desc: "Voznesensky isn't perfect, but he's perfect for West Russia. The working man in Russia has no better choice than the founder of modern Russian democracy. The DSNP blends the best of old Soviet socialism with new democratic institutions to create a democratic socialist party that protects workers' lives and liberties.\n\nThe DSNP will get a head start on their election campaign. Voznesensky will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting his Presidential record and plans for the future. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc: "\"West Russians, workers, countrymen, you have been liberated. Some of you have been liberated from noblemen, juntas, and collaborators who expected you to work to make them richer. Some of you have been liberated from authoritarian communists who valued you only for your output as a line item in a centrally planned budget. But now you have a true friend in your government. Our party fights for you, not for your servitude. We fight that you may earn a fair wage for fair work, that you may feel secure from job precarity, and that you may retire with a well-deserved pension. We are the DSNP, and we are your party.\"\n\nVoznesensky will go on a speaking tour in factories across the [KOM.GetName]. He will play to the party's industrial base and promote himself as a friend of the working class. By shoring up support from our core constituency, we should have a strong showing in the election."
 KOM_second_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc: "Since many of our voters are new to our party, it would be wise to teach them what we stand for. West Russia needs to know what our ideology and policies are if we are to win a mandate in the 1968 elections.\n\nThe DSNP will publish their party platform across the [KOM.GetName]. In it, they will detail their plans for wage, occupational safety, and pension reform. They will also make it clear that their ultimate goals are to reunify the whole of Russia and apply their pro-worker agenda across all of its regions. Nobody with a heart could oppose this platform!"
 KOM_second_election_the_PSD_campaign_desc: "The [KOM.GetName] is a new and unstable country. Many of its people have only recently been amalgamated into it, and have never experienced a free election in their lives. The last thing they need is more utopian visions by ersatz wings of the old Center bloc. Only Svetlana Stalina's PSD can provide the order and stability that Russia so desperately craves.\n\nThe PSD will get a head start on their election campaign. Stalina will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting her commitment to political stability and moderate plans for reform. As many West Russians will be choosing her for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc: "If the people of West Russia want anything, it's stability. Having experienced the collapse of the Union at the hands of the Nazis, control of their homes changing hands between different warlords again and again, and finally reunification under the [KOM.GetName], they need an end to the chaos in their lives. They'll be glad to know that Stalina is just the woman for the job.\n\nThe PSD will publish its platform across the country. It will detail plans for rapid reclamation of the unliberated zones to restore the old Russia. It will mention their social democratic economic policies and protections for free speech, but will also emphasize their expansion of the military and police with an aim to create a safe and secure West Russia. This should capture the hearts of the many weary West Russians now joined to our Republic."
 KOM_second_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc: "\"While West Russians may now breathe free, the wolves lurking at our borders hunger for their blood. The DSNP and SMR may wax enthusiastic about their social 'reforms', but none of them can tell you how they'll keep you safe from an invasion. But our party has an answer: Funding the finest military in Russia.\"\n\nThe PSD will appeal to national defense in order to rally votes. They will unveil a plan to double defense spending and purchase state of the art equipment from overseas. Peace comes from superior firepower, and voters will know that only the PSD can keep the peace in the [KOM.GetName]."
 KOM_second_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc: "The Komi Republic began with a dream; a dream that one day all Russia would be one, democratic, and free. A dream that prosperity would abound from Murmansk to Magadan, not because it was planned by party bureaucrats, but because Russia's leaders trusted its people to build it themselves. Now that the Komi Republic has been transcended by the [KOM.GetName] we can shed the shackles of the old Center bloc that kept the dream down; Ivan Morozov and the SMR alone will make that dream come true.\n\nThe SMR will get a head start on their election campaign. Morozov will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting his beautiful vision of liberty and prosperity. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc: "\"You Russian students are the builders of the new tomorrow. The DSNP only cares for men who swing a wrench and the PSD chide you to 'follow your elders,' the same elders who let our nation fall to the Germans. I have a different message, dear youth: Russia needs you. It needs your creativity. It needs the diligence you show in your studies. It needs your mastery of the arts and sciences. Most of all, it needs your courage to stand up to the old failures and create new successes. An SMR Russia is your Russia, and it will be the Russia of your grandchildren when you retire to a life of comfort and culture.\"\n\nMorozov will launch a speaking tour across the [KOM.GetName]'s universities. He will campaign hard for the youth vote. While the youth may seem an odd choice of a support base, their dedication to him now will likely last their whole lives; Morozov is nothing if not forward-thinking. This should help give us an edge in the [GetYear] elections."
 KOM_second_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc: "Morozov is the man with the plan. He always was ever since he'd saved Russian industry during the war by organizing the Eastward evacuation, and he's going to save the [KOM.GetName] now with his extensive reforms. He will unveil to all the people of West Russia his blueprint for their future.\n\nThe SMR will publish their platform across the [KOM.GetName]. It will detail their affirmative action plans for Russia's women and ethnic minorities, as well as their blueprint for expanding private enterprise to increase economic growth. While the platform will uphold the socialist roots of the SMR, it will portray them as focused first and foremost on the personal liberty and prosperity of every West Russian. This message should resonate with the electorate, many of whom will have their first taste of real freedom."
 KOM_second_election_let_the_race_begin_desc: "Campaigning season is over and the [KOM.GetName] is heading to the polls. Each candidate put up a good fight, and analysts see this election as anyone's game. Russians will soon gather around their radio sets to hear the final tallies and find out who will lead their nation for the next 5 years: Voznesensky's democratic socialists, Stalina's stability-minded centrists, or Morozov's liberal democrats.\n\nMany will be elated by the results, others dismayed. Yet one thing all can agree on is that a free and fair election was finally held across West Russia; a triumph in a land that has never known a peaceful transfer of power. No matter who wins the most votes, democracy has won in the [KOM.GetName]."

Not for us the tyranny of the Eurasianists, not for us the violence of the Communist Left, and not for us the falsehoods and demagoguery of radicalism! In this and only this do we place our trust: a dedication to Democratic Socialism, one which is beholden neither to the will of an iron hierarchy nor to the nightmarish callings of frenzied agitators.\nYes, Socialism! We dare use that term divorced from the tyrant-Bolsheviks of old, for unlike those who would plaster a Red Tsardom to their walls to keep them safe, we are not afraid of listening to the people - and we are not afraid of acting on what we hear. Only Socialism can keep us loyal to our people, and only Democracy can keep Socialism true to its course. There can be no other option."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_new_republic_desc: "The old Republic was broken by its own best intentions: as Social Democracy was built it absorbed the dregs of every ideology across the political spectrum. A paradox of tolerance was at work, where at every opportunity we promoted the principles that we held so dear, and at every opportunity radicals used our idealism to undermine our grip. Now, as the President consolidates his grip, we will have an opportunity to truly express our beliefs in a purified form.\n\nA form where all will truly breathe free without inconvenient enemies and their alluring agitation-politics. A form where the worst of Voznesensky's opponents, and without a doubt the Republic's enemies by extension, can be discredited once and for all. A new Republic - and a different Russia."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_free_electoral_commission_desc: "Electoral Commissions were a controversial introduction to the old Republic, as repeated efforts to suborn the legitimacy of these Commissions by our associated extremist fringes made every election a headache. That said, our elections are still in desperate need of neutral third-party observation to ensure that said extremist fringes never again regain a hold on our electoral scene. We will introduce a new Commission to solve these problems, one whose neutrality will be firmly guarded by the President and the Head of the Legislature to keep the powers of state in check.\n\nThere are some who claim that the Electoral Commission is in fact simply one more tool in our President's pocket, and that there are in fact widespread claims that the Commission is as steeped in money as its predecessor. These extremist calls will be disregarded as the treasonous claims they are. The truth is this: we are the instrument of the People's Will.\n\nThose that disagree are more than welcome to take it up with us in person."
 KOM_voznesensky_an_urban_rural_platform_desc: "Democracy in Russia is like navigating a tightrope - one is perpetually forced to navigate between two worlds, each with vastly different requirements and lived experiences. Just as Janus was two-faced, so too must we adopt a two-faced approach: to look to the world of the village and the world of the urbanite and balance both their needs. Thankfully, Vosnesensky's long experience in Government has given him an intuitive grasp on these two chambers of the heart of Russia.\n\nWe will adopt a mixed approach, pushing for the gradual integration of the economy through separate, equal development. The farmer shall be given an equal voice and support for his labor, on an equal platform with the laborer at the factory, and we shall push for the organization of a true Farmer-Labor working class that can stand as one despite their asymmetrical backgrounds. Only when the two chambers of the Russian Heart beat as one shall Russia be united!"
 KOM_voznesensky_stand_for_democracy_desc: "There are certain ideals for which we cannot afford to compromise: chief among them would be our oft-quoted support for true Democratic ideals. This is what separates us from the radical rabble to our left and right - our absolute, unyielding conviction that the people alone can decide their mandate, and that no group of stuffed suits should decide the course of the Nation alone. As such, we must develop a new mandate, a Compact with the People, that will appeal to the men and women of Russia. Their alienation must not be allowed to fester, lest it consume the body politic in the sickness of extremism.\n\nA healthy level of propagandization about just how committed we are, accompanied by quiet suppression of the remnants of the old extremist groups, will keep our citizens on the straight and narrow - and a rhetorical focus on progressive legislation will convince them that we are on their side. A carrot and stick approach might not be particularly sophisticated, but that is the beauty of politics, yes?"
 KOM_voznesensky_democratic_idealism_desc: "Just as the poets fled to Tomsk, so too did the tired and huddled masses to the old Republic - despite all that has happened here, we retain that essential spark of democratic energy, that infallible belief that our voices matter. This is what kept the Old Republic going, even as its institutions fell apart around us and the stresses of extremism dragged it into the muck - and it is this idealism that will empower us to build a new dream, stronger and better than the old.\n\nA push for unionism, continued efforts to weed out irregularities in our voting system, and the expansion of our voting system to ensure all walks of life will have an equal say in elections - we are writing into law our passion for Democracy, and our love shall spill onto the streets of our shared home. May Russia live and breathe free, for as long as we draw breath we shall never cease in pulling her towards the public good."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_united_government_desc: "For all our talk of democracy, a certain degree of electoral unity is necessary to ensure our legislative branch is not vulnerable to the attacks that crippled our forebears. We must strive for a government that is both attuned to the popular voice and unfettered in their capability to carry out that which is mandated to us. As such, we will continue the broad-based United Coalition strategy - the extremist elements which we collaborated with, however, will no longer be welcome.\n\nInstead, we will pull in diverse elements from all across society, creating a truly broad-based party capable of responding to popular demands. Unionists, soldiers and street-sweepers shall all have their voices heard in our Coalition, and minor parties pressured into upholding their interests as well - this might fragment the power of our opposition, but democracy is not about opposition, is it not? After all, it is not competition, but representation, that makes Russia great. Why would we ever change that?"
 KOM_voznesensky_a_party_consensus_desc: "If we are ever to get our Government in Order, our control of our own Party must be an overriding priority. The DSNP is a hidebound institution, having inherited much of our factionalist divides from the old era, and even though our opponents are firmly out of office we must ensure that secondary allegiances are wholly uprooted to keep the Party vital. Dedication to the common interest and our party platform will be strictly enforced on members and legislators, with dissent punished by expulsion.\n\nWe will also develop grassroots organizations to keep our party members loyal, developing community ties to local leadership that will sustain our members' electoral campaigns - this support comes with inevitable compromises, and even weakness to the influence of the Party on important issues, but it is all necessary to keep their best interests aligned with our own. Otherwise, what would be the point of the Party in the first place?"
 KOM_voznesensky_relentless_progress_desc: "The political position our party finds itself is already described by contemporaries as \"Democratic Hegemony\", with a majority of the seats ensuring us practically full control of the legislative, provided we avoid internal strife and the party acts as a single block. This has to lead many of our representatives to doubt the usefulness of the Democratic front and cooperation with rightists as a whole, seeing how there's no need for painful compromises when we can wrestle control of the legislative on our own.\n\nWhile this may be a controversial move to make, we might have to agree with these circles and start distancing ourselves from the other parties. After all, the people of Russia haven't given the DSNP a vote of confidence for it to be bogged down by uncooperative conservatives."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_doctrine_of_compromise_desc: "While the DSNP holds the dominant position in the Assembly, its status as the ruling party is secured by a rather small margin, with support from the other democratic parties often necessary to ensure an indisputable majority.\n\nThough a good portion of our own deputies is dissatisfied with this state of dependence on rightist politicians and factions to pass our own legislation, our leadership has to recognize the unfortunate truth, that maintaining the Democratic Front with moderate rightists is the only way to ensure unity of the political center, for without it the Republic would fall to extremism."
 KOM_voznesensky_past_the_scandals_desc: "Though the DSNP is the guarantor of prosperity in the Republic and the party that unified Western Russia under the banner of democracy, it has eventually become evident that the pedestal of popular support it's so used to enjoying is quite brittle. With every scandal as minor as a single bribe, the public perception of our apparatus shifts from praise to condemnation, and many say that since its ascension to power the party has been permeated with crooked bureaucrats and thieving executives.\n\nWhile over the years these scandals have become the new normal, as public opinion eventually stabilizes after each one, and any outrage so far has been relatively minor, eventually any of them might spiral out of control, and the ensuing political crisis may cost our party its ruling place or even the permanent stability of the Republic. To prevent such a disaster, we should improve our public image, which will ultimately secure genuine popular support we so desperately require. The recent reunification should serve well to be presented as the moment when the DSNP was reborn from a den of corruption that has abandoned its founding principles. Now it has become a truly democratic association struggling for popular welfare, that is built on the principles of honesty and open government.\n\nAs such, initiatives have been approved for local anti-corruption campaigns, showing the electorate that the party acknowledges its problems and is ready to fight them openly. Whether this will prove effective is another question entirely, though this will be the first step on the way to overcoming the distrust many feel towards the DSNP."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_populist_agenda_desc: "Not so long ago, in the disunited lands of Russia, populism was employed by many a warlord to justify their rule. As such, some view it as a natural tool of a cruel age, invented by despots to bamboozle their subjects.\n\nHowever, we in the halls of power clearly see the benefits of populism - promising a better future to the people, fostering unity between them and the government, and securing their trust in our mandate are all beneficial to democracy as much as to any would-be dictator. Let us cultivate healthy populism in our party program, ensuring popular support in our march to progress."
 KOM_voznesensky_an_all_russian_autonomy_commission_desc: "The territory of Russia, in the historical process of her expansion, has absorbed the lands of many ethnicities, their population varying from millions to mere hundreds, each with a culture, unlike the others. Since the days of the October revolution, Lenin's government, believing in the principles of self-determination, granted the peoples of the new Soviet Union significant autonomy, the legacy of which we still carry, our Republic itself having emerged from the Komi ASSR.\n\nWith our authority now extending throughout all of Western Russia, 'The Autonomy Question' as it came to be known, has become a more significant issue, with notable figures from various ethnicities dissatisfied with the current status quo. While outright secessionists are few and irrelevant, we could satisfy the wishes of moderate particularist circles by introducing a separate body to improve the status of minorities and serve as an intermediary between the central government and the autonomies in matters where direct control is unnecessary. While some criticize this as 'soft separatism' and 'subversion of ethnic equality', many agree that this is the only way to guard the many ethnicities of Russia from the tyranny of the majority."
 KOM_voznesensky_prioritize_majoritarian_concerns_desc: "As Russia always has been a multinational state, her many former governments left a number of ethnic policies for our Republic to inherit, including Bolshevik self-rule in various autonomies, which we currently practice in a slightly amended form, adapted for our democratic system. Though intended to grant the needed freedoms to the minorities, since the unification many are expressing disapproval of this system, calling for even greater autonomy.\n\nThis notion, though fitting the DSNP's general line, has been met with staunch opposition in the Assembly, with some especially vocal critics branding it as \"eroding the principle of universal equality the Republic is built on, through giving the minorities undemocratic overrepresentation\". Many of the more moderate deputies are abstaining from the direct debate, but are evidently opposed to shaking up the status quo. While we could still force the initiative through, it could undermine the party's stability, and perhaps even sabotage the democracy we struggled so much to build. As such, we better forget about this proposal as soon as possible and move on to more pressing matters."
 KOM_voznesensky_extend_social_welfare_desc: "One of the key elements of any socialist agenda, ours not being an exception, is the promise of welfare for citizens of the state. Many fought for us on the fields of battle and gave us their vote to ensure this better tomorrow for their children, and it's due time we honored this promise.\n\nWith the initial stage of the long-awaited Reunification complete, we have achieved precious peace, allowing us to turn the necessary attention inwards, to finally build a working system of social welfare for all."
 KOM_voznesensky_campaign_for_the_disadvantaged_desc: "Despite our recent general welfare campaign, many of our citizens remain in a powerless and downtrodden state, experiencing difficulties with integration into the Republic's social and political environment. The Reunification, though it brought democracy to the people of Russia, it robbed many of their old way of life, leaving them stranded on the border between conflicting values and realities of their new life.\n\nSuch people, when not shielded from uncalled hardships, often turn to more radical options, aiming to tear down the society they view as downtrodding. As such, before the disadvantaged turn into radicals and terrorists, we must lend them a helping hand in integration."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_shining_precedent_desc: "Though for years our rivals and critics argued that a functional democracy could not exist within the brutal realities of warlordism and banditry that plagued Russia since her defeat, our new republic has disproven this claim by the fact of its very existence! It withstood the onslaught of radicals within and without, right and left, and has carried the torch of popular freedom from the Volga and to the White Sea. Breaking the expectations of the cynical, it has triumphed in war as well as peace, fighting for progress across both the fields of battle and halls of government. Our efforts here have established a precedent, that will outlast any tyranny, for, in the hearts and minds of the people, our Republic shall persist through the hardest of crises.\n\nThree hurrahs for Russia! Three hurrahs for Democracy!"
 KOM_stalina_the_reconstruction_government_desc: "Our government, tasked with the salvation of the Republic, and eventually - Russia, has secured the West of the country, and it is now our duty to protect it from threats within and without. We shall do all in our power to wipe out extremists, restore prosperity and stability in the lives of our citizens, and eventually step down, leaving Russia united and free.\n\nThis herculean mission will not be finished in a day, a month, or perhaps even in years, but Russia's history has taught us that rallied under a strong authority, she overcame countless challenges before, and we are here to ensure she shall do so again."
 KOM_stalina_strengthen_the_institutions_desc: "Our main task, other than securing stability, is to ensure that the new democracy that will arise in the place of our Emergency Government, never meets the fate of the old one, crushed by shady backroom deals, informal agreements, intrigue, and powerplays beyond competency.\n\nIf we are to establish a New Republic, then at its center must stand legitimate institutions backed by public trust, with their offices having strictly defined limits of power and authority, so that biased and informal cliques will shackle Russia no longer."
 KOM_stalina_crack_down_on_corruption_desc: "Unfortunately for our cause, even an apparatus tasked with saving democracy itself is not immune to corruption. Thankfully, with the broadened powers granted to the emergency government under the pretext of national salvation will allow us to confront crooks and thieves directly, in these trying times, when corruption is little less than treason and should be stamped out, lest it finishes the Republic in its moment of weakness."
 KOM_stalina_a_stabilizing_thaw_desc: "It seems our promise to eventually restore democracy was perceived quite differently by the populace, with some circles already making demands to start gradual liberalization in their areas of interest, arguing that the worst is behind us.\n\nWhile a few hardliners and military figures disagree, honoring a popular request will yield us much-needed credibility as a government on guard of democracy, and loosening press censorship and the like will help maintain the normality of life in a free society."
 KOM_stalina_a_supervised_state_desc: "With us explicitly defining the Reconstruction Government as a temporary measure to protect the Republic's democracy, the rapidly rising campaigns to reintroduce freedoms have only begun to get in the way of our decision-making. While most of those groups are harmless, some movements, particularly those for the reintroduction of press freedoms, are particularly outspoken critics, and thus cannot be ignored.\n\nThough some are calling to listen to those demands, it would be more rational to silence them with a decisive refusal - liberalizing now would only defeat the point of the state of emergency by giving forces aiming to destabilize the nation a legal means of distributing their agitation. For as long as the Reconstruction Government holds, we'll have to maintain those restrictions in the name of stability and safety of our citizens."
 KOM_stalina_the_militarys_approval_desc: "Though the Emergency Government was largely formed by an agreement between Stalina's supporters in the National Assembly, and pro-democratic officers subordinated to Grigorenko, the two have since acted independently of each other, only cooperating explicitly in the initial securing of power.\n\nIf we are to move forward, we'll have to tighten the cooperation between those who protect the Republic in the halls of government and those who do their duty in the army. Thankfully, Stalina's close friendship with Grigorenko can help coerce him into directing the army to support the initiatives of the Government directly, cracking down on radicals and ensuring stability in the streets. Of course, this agreement will not be like the unspoken alliances of plotting bureaucrats in the old republic, with the military's full subordination to the President being formally codified."
 KOM_stalina_the_renewed_defense_of_the_republic_act_desc: "In order to maintain a strong enough army to unify all of Russia, we need to increase conscription. Unfortunately, we are facing a problem regarding conscription. Several loopholes exist in our conscription laws that allow many of our able-bodied citizens to avoid being conscripted.\n\nAs such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have decided to draft a new piece of legislation, the Defense of the Republic Act. this ensures that our citizens can't exploit loopholes to get out of service. Alongside dealing with loopholes, the Defense of the Republic Act renews the two-year conscription periods. If we are to reunite the Motherland, we need all hands on deck."
 KOM_stalina_the_national_sovereignty_act_desc: "Russia possesses many strategic resources, the most valuable to our government being oil. However, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government feel that we give out these resources too easily, allowing them to fall into the hands of our enemies. This is absurd, and something has to be done to rectify this matter.\n\nIntroducing the National Sovereignty Act. This law severely limits the exports of strategic resources to nations without defensive ties to the Motherland. In short, if a nation wants our resources, they must declare themselves an ally of the Russian Republic. This shall make the Russian Republic a more attractive ally to nations within the international community, and will help protect the Motherland. At the end of the day, that is all that matters."
 KOM_stalina_the_executive_directive_act_desc: "During times of crisis, the nation can't stop to wait for the mire of bureaucracy. As such, President Stalina - through the recently created Executive Directive Act - has been granted the ability to issue directives to handle any crisis that threatens national security unilaterally.\n\nThis allows President Stalina to govern quickly and efficiently, side-stepping all of the red tape that would normally impede her actions. Some may protest this further centralization of power, but the Executive Directive Act is a necessary step towards the goal of a united Motherland. President Stalina guided the Republic through a time of crisis once before, and she will likely have to do so repeatedly in the future. Our enemies will not wait patiently for our government to come to a consensus."
 KOM_stalina_the_party_registry_act_desc: "It is clear to the Reconstruction Government that the organizations that are allowed to participate in our government must be more thoroughly vetted in order to safeguard the Republic. As such, President Stalina has approved the Party Registry Act.\n\nAll political parties and organizations that wish to operate within the Republic must be officially approved and investigated, to ensure that they are not affiliated with extremist groups. This process shall be carried out by a wholly impartial and unbiased state-run body. While it may be staffed solely with former PSD members, these men and women have sworn to govern solely in the interests of the Republic, and would never allow bias to creep into their judgements. Any who doubt these comments can submit their complaints to the National Reconstruction Council, to be considered once there is enough time available to do so."
 KOM_stalina_empower_the_party_desc: "The PSD is currently the largest party in our Republic, and is home to a variety of centrist ideologies. However, the party's current structure does not allow for the various factions within our party to be heard. As such, the PSD must evolve: it shall become the 'Party of Power.' With this restructuring, the PSD will allow for greater discussion between its various actions, with greater ideological variety inside the party than outside the party. The PSD already serves as the main party for those who support democracy and stand against radicalism, so any consensus reached within the PSD will effectively be the same as a consensus reached within the legislature. The majority consensus shall apply to all party members, and that consensus shall be reached through free, democratic discussion.\n\nOf course, more radical ideologues will remain outside the party, so that they can't derail discussions with their extremist propaganda."
 KOM_stalina_public_concessions_desc: "The PSD and the Reconstruction Government have been highly focused on destroying extremism's influence within the Republic, but it is important that we do not forget our roots. The PSD serves the people, and our policies must reflect this. As such, President Stalina has decided to dedicate funds to the people, in the forms of welfare and pensions. Welfare services and pensions shall be expanded, and our government shall in general ensure that our citizens are taken care of. No citizen shall starve on our streets, no person shall be left without a home in our cities. No veterans shall be left destitute for sacrificing themselves for their country, and no citizen shall need to turn to radicalism merely to survive."
 KOM_stalina_allow_for_a_split_desc: "When in the process of establishing the Reconstruction Government the PSD de-facto absorbed the other parties of the democratic front in, many agreed it was a necessary measure. Now, however, even with our efforts to solidify this union, cracks in the system are starting to show, with activists of the former SMR and DSNP aiming to reestablish those parties once again.\n\nAfter a brief period of discussion, many in the administration seem not to mind this, seeing the division of the political center as a natural phenomenon, and agreeing that the old party structure is not to blame for the situation the Republic now finds itself in. With Stalina's approval, the two parties are soon to be restored, though many of the deputies are to stay in the PSD securing its status as the sole ruling party in the Reconstruction Government and ensuring full control of it."
 KOM_stalina_keep_the_big_tent_model_desc: "On the very onset of the Reconstruction Government's establishment, some deputies expressed concern over the fate of the Republic's democratic landscape, presenting the idea that the only way to recover from this crisis would be to preserve the center coalition, centralized around the PSD, as a broad force of containment against radicals.\n\nWith the question of the former SMR and DSNP cadre leaving the PSD to refound their parties, this suggestion has been bought up again and rallied around by a large fraction in the government, arguing that if the unity of the center would be jeopardized, the democratic forces would fall divided. With this proposal practically guaranteeing governmental stability, Stalina has decided to veto the split, cementing her administration's nature as a grand union of all three former moderate parties, disempowering any remaining real opposition."
 KOM_stalina_ensure_free_elections_desc: "Elections, when they are held, shall be free and fair. We cannot make the same mistakes as the previous government, the right to vote for everyone must be upheld. Fair elections will ensure a stable republic and a working, capable democracy.\n\nTo ensure fair elections are upheld, Stalina has authorized for new institutions that promote democracy and freedom be established. These institutions will make sure everyone gets an equal chance to vote. They will also ensure the government does not try to influence or affect the elections themselves or its results. There will be no more chaos at the polls!"
 KOM_stalina_the_constitution_of_national_reconstruction_desc: "Until Russia is reunified, the state of emergency must remain in place. To this end, we will enact a new constitution, one that holds true to the values of national reconstruction and anti-extremism. If that means putting a limit on freedoms and individual rights for now, so be it. Our Republic has to be protected from the radicals who wish to destroy it, no matter what!"
 KOM_stalina_faith_in_democracy_desc: "The state of emergency must end, the government cannot maintain a republic with no elections. We cannot call ourselves a democracy if we do not even follow basic democratic principles! This means - come the end of Stalina's lawful term, elections will be called, and the Republic will choose between a new President and Stalina.\n\nEnding the state of emergency will also give the people of the Republic more rights and freedoms. Allowing the people to exercise these rights will be the first big test of our remade democracy under Stalina. Hopefully, we will not relive the past."
 KOM_stalina_freedom_sovereignty_patriotism_desc: "Svoboda, Suverenitet, i Patriotizm - the motto of the Sovereign Democratic Party. We are the party of strength. We are the party of sovereignty. We are the party that fights for all of the people. And most of all, we are the party for a strong Russia that works for all of its citizens. The people know our platform, and have given us a broad mandate to carry it out. Let us not disappoint them by going back on our promises."
 KOM_stalina_a_democratic_centre_desc: "The PSD stands for many things. For freedom and democracy, sure. But for moderation above all. The people of Russia do not need radical and extreme solutions for their problems. Demagogues have destroyed their country, and they do not wish for another one. They want sensible and reasonable solutions that don't affect their lives any more than necessary. The PSD is at the center of politics, and abhors extremism in all forms. Democracy and moderation is our guiding principle. And we will draw a hard line against anyone who goes against it."
 KOM_stalina_survey_republic_elections_desc: "Russia is a land of many peoples and ethnicities. Many minorities have a degree of independence, allowing them to have their own republics and elections. We must ensure they retain their autonomy. And part of that is eliminating any corrupting outside influence in these republics.\n\nSmaller units of organization have had issues with election fraud for a long time. No longer will this be tolerated. We will begin keeping a closer eye on these elections, and how they are carried out. Then we can be assured these peoples are truly picking their own destinies."
 KOM_stalina_centralize_election_administration_desc: "Free and fair elections must be ensured throughout our Republic. And that means fraud cannot be tolerated. We will establish a non-partisan agency, tasked with rooting out and eliminating election fraud and corruption. Election administration will be placed under federal control, although we will make exceptions for local elections in minority republics. Vote-rigging and other such actions are a threat to the very legitimacy of our democracy. And it will be eliminated."
 KOM_stalina_no_room_for_corruption_desc: "Russia has gotten a reputation as a place where an elite political class can live off of the wealth squeezed out of the suffering peasants. So it was in the days of the tsars, when rich aristocrats would live in sumptuous mansions surrounded by the grass and mud huts of the serfs. And so it was in the days of the Soviet Union, when party members would race to their dachas in handbuilt limousines, passing the horse-carriages of the Proletariat. No longer! Corruption will be eliminated in Russia. Massive fines await those who seek to use their positions to profit from the people. And there will be no exceptions or tolerance at all."
 KOM_stalina_the_paramount_civic_duty_desc: "Any Republic is only as good as the people it represents. Too often, people of other nations have allowed others to do the deciding for them, rather than face their issues head on. The results have been disastrous every time. We will not let that happen here. Voting is key to our democracy, and so is actually running for positions as well. Local elections and referenda are highly important, no less so than national ones. If the people understand this, and act on it, we will secure our democracy for a long time to come."
 KOM_stalina_the_new_russian_century_desc: "Tsushima and the Treaty of Portsmouth. Tannenberg and Brest-Litovsk. Barbarossa and Generalplan Ost. Russia has been the victim of disastrous defeats and destruction at the hands of foreign powers. But we refuse to let that continue. No longer will the 20th century be known as Russia's century of humiliation. Because with the new republic, Russia once again rises to prominence on the world stage! We shall finally be strong once more, and we shall make this new century into a Russian century - a century with Russia claiming its position as a world power."
 KOM_stalina_accept_the_big_tent_model_desc: "The PSD has been a \"big-tent\" party for the entire span of its existence, accepting a wide variety of policy positions, ideologies, and approaches towards getting things done within its membership. This unique structure has been instrumental in bringing us to power - it ensures that the entirety of the acceptable political spectrum is represented within our party. To work with other parties, therefore, is unnecessary. If the opposition wishes to achieve positions of power within the Republic, it will be through PSD institutions. There are plenty of opportunities to side with our party - to not accede to them is simply the choice of the opposition to weaken themselves."
 KOM_stalina_justice_before_compromise_desc: "We won't work across the aisle, and why should we? Who wants to water down our necessary laws and policies, just for the sake of patting ourselves on the back that we worked with a few minority parties? It is unnecessary, as we have the strength to get things done by ourselves, without the consultation of the other parties. Moreover, the people explicitly elected us to do these things, not any other party. They wanted a strictly PSD term, and they got it. And we will not deliver anything less than what we promised."
 KOM_stalina_the_oppositions_finest_desc: "Many other opposition parties exist in Russia who will never cooperate with us. Their individual members, however, are another matter. Many opposition members exist who agree with us on at least one issue. Sometimes, more than one. We can try to use that support to help get our bills and reforms passed. Working across the aisles is much easier than just trying to force things through on our own."
 KOM_stalina_roots_for_healthy_competition_desc: "Sure, crushing our opposition into the ground with a massive monolithic organization is tempting, but we have more noble goals in mind. Democracy is not one group of people steamrolling the other. It is a group of people of differing perspectives and beliefs coming together to solve their problems. Thus, working with other parties is essential. Merely consolidating our own power at all costs will lead to a single-party state, just like in the Soviet Union."
 KOM_stalina_towards_a_sovereign_future_desc: "It is time for the signature policy of the PSD to be unveiled. The National Sovereignty Act will change our diplomatic position forevermore. Strategic resources in Russia, such as oil, will be severely restricted from the international market. But this is not a protectionist act, or one aimed at autarky. These limitations will be lifted for those with defensive ties with our Republic. If one wishes to gain access to our bountiful resources, one must make an arrangement with us to assist our military development. And everybody wants these strategic materials."
 KOM_stalina_right_the_pasts_wrongs_desc: "Any objective view of Russia's long history will find many shameful acts and practices. The rampant discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. The rampant misogyny towards women. And poor treatment of the disabled. And we say \"enough!\"\n\nWe shall move forward with a socially egalitarian agenda. Our crusade will end and outlaw these practices, and ensure equal treatment under the law. For aren't we all Russians? And aren't Russians guaranteed rights?"
 KOM_stalina_campaign_against_discrimination_desc: "For too long, the pogoms and other acts of discrimination have kept Russia as a backward state from the middle ages. Even worse, horrific acts of religious persecution still occur in Russia at this very moment, in our supposedly enlightened time. This will stop immediately. We will grant legal mechanisms and rules for Jews, Muslims, and other religious minorities to defend and protect themselves. We will combat pervasive religious hatred with the full force of the law."
 KOM_stalina_charter_of_universal_rights_desc: "It's not enough to pass a few rules granting citizens legal rights. We must also codify it into our constitution. The great democracies of the world have unassailable provisions that protect their people, and so will we. And thus, we bring forth an Equal Rights Amendment. Modeled after the Bill of Rights in America, we will make being an egalitarian nation that grants everyone equal rights a permanent feature of Russia. And that is going to be hard for any would-be authoritarian to roll back."
 KOM_stalina_decommunization_and_dewarlordization_desc: "Symbols may seem just symbols at first, sure. But to many people, who have suffered under the tyrants of Russia, they are extremely hurtful and terrifying reminders of times we wish to move beyond. And that any political party, no matter how small, will gleefully use these symbols to identify themselves with the monsters of the past is disgusting.\n\nProminent symbols of the communist regime and certain warlords will be banned, except for art and historical purposes. These legacies have no place in modern Russia. And if the people that march under them can't find something new, maybe it's a sign their beliefs should be left in the past as well."
 KOM_stalina_a_united_russia_desc: "Russia is still geographically torn asunder. By other warlords in the east. And by the Germans in the west. But though we may not be united in a territorial sense, we are united in a much bigger one. For all Russians are united in spirit. And we are a state that shows this unity more than any other. We march united, and committed. For a Russia united by equality. And a Russia united by a strong national identity. That unity and commitment towards this Russia will see us through till the end."
 KOM_stalina_a_shining_precedent_desc: "We have done it. People doubted that the PSD would exercise its authority in a peaceful, constructive, and democratic manner. But we have. Our agenda has been enacted entirely within the confines of the law, and with no extraordinary measures taken. And the will of the people has been respected, to boot. This is a glorious victory for democracy, showing that great change can be accomplished within the system. Let us hope this convinces the population that our system is sustainable and strong as well."
 KOM_stalina_honor_the_republics_heroes_desc: "Due to our history as a unifier of Western Russia, our Republic is a Republic of heroes. Innumerable men and women fought to make our Republic whole and put down the tyrannical extremists and warlords that once blighted Russia from Arkhangelsk to Samara. After such service to our Republic, we, too, deserve to provide a service to our veterans and heroic soldiers. Veterans of the West Russian War and Unification Wars shall be taken care of, provided with a generous stipident as a reward for their service.\n\nAdditionally, this action presents a wonderful opportunity for the image of our party. Regardless of one's alignment within the PSD, all of our Deputies and regional politicians can at least agree on the fact that Russia's heroes deserve recognition. Let us assist them, and in doing so, assist the longevity of our party's administration."
 KOM_stalina_emphasize_shared_identity_desc: "Regardless of our heritage, be we Great Russian, Tatar, Jewish, German, or Ukrainian, we are all united in our participation within our democracy, and our residence within the Republic. Whilst the politicians of the left and right may call out to silence peoples solely for their faith or ethnicities, we have the position above all of them, atop the pinnacle of democracy. Our policy regardign ethnicity, thusly, shall focus on the fact that all of us are citizens of the Republic - participants in the grand democratic experiment that has already liberated so much of our Motherland.\n\nWe may call ourselves Great Russians, or Tatars, or Ukrainians - but, in heart, we are all equal in patriotic humanity."
 KOM_stalina_redeeming_our_history_desc: "The streets of the Republic were no longer a battleground for feuding radicals, nor were political assassinations a viable way to mark the passing of the days. The leadership of Svetlana Stalina had cleaned up the behaviour of the people, but it could not wipe away their opinions. The debate of how the history of our Republic should be discussed has become a contentious subject in the halls of legislature, with many calling for a focus on the \"Glory of Russia\". They say that leftism and division has diluted the common identity of the Russian people, and desire for that to be rectified. The Left has mobilised their political capital against this, but it's the Right who holds the keys to power that are needed for the unification of Russia."
 KOM_authdem_the_russian_economy_desc: "After over a decade of German terror bombing and the chronic insecurity caused by the raids of rival warlords, economic activity in our corner of Russia is on life support. Now that the government is stable and we have control over our own borders, resuscitating the economy will be a priority for the new government."
 KOM_authdem_development_for_a_modern_russia_desc: "Our state exists in a dangerous neighborhood, with the Germans to the west and a motley collection of pretender states to the east. While private enterprise and free competition will continue to be encouraged within the Republic, we don't have the luxury of waiting for economic development from the bottom up. Modernity will come to Russia under the leadership of the PSD and the strong guidance of state-owned enterprises in crucial sectors, complementing its private companies. We have no other choice, even if it means that there will be sacrifices asked of the people and the workers along the way."
 KOM_authdem_prioritize_state_development_desc: "Getting the economy off the ground is a herculean task in any developing country, even more so in an economy like Russia's, reeling from years of conflict. The PSD has decided that the state must utilize its coffers and manpower to jumpstart the new economy by establishing state-owned enterprises to develop critical sectors of the economy and to advance key infrastructure projects throughout the Republic. Some would call this inefficient, arguing that the state would run these projects at a loss - we answer that nobody else is willing to lay the foundations of a modern economy, and unless they have a better idea, they can stay out of the way!"
 KOM_authdem_invite_foreign_investment_desc: "To say the least, Russia is starved of capital. Its productive capacity has been funneled into interminable warfare, and the turbulent political situation has naturally made potential investors extremely cautious to risk putting their funds in enterprises that could easily go bust. Building wealth inside the country takes time that we simply do not have. Attracting investment from outside, on the other hand, is significantly easier.\n\nThe international business community craves new markets, and Russia with its large population and abundant natural resources has a great, untapped potential for profit. Foreign companies can expect low taxes and many potential customers, but they must remember one thing: Russia is a sovereign nation, and they are only there as guests."
 KOM_authdem_invite_foreign_investment_tt: "This may be seen by our §gbase§! as a §Rbetrayal of our principles§!."
 KOM_authdem_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc: "The territory of Russia is rich in natural resources - oil, minerals, and crops. Too often, however, these resources are used as a means of personal enrichment for the various warlords, without a care for the development of a modern economy. Now that the Republic is exerting control over a growing swath of Russian territory, we should establish a government agency to take stock of the bounties of Russian soil and to ensure that they are directed for the good of the state and its people."
 KOM_authdem_consolidate_the_defense_industry_desc: "If the Republic wants to take the fight to the other pretender states in the East - and, eventually, against the Germans in the West - it is essential that we have a defense industry capable of supplying the vast quantities of equipment our new model military will require. This cannot be done through small enterprises and cottage industries: we must think larger, consolidating our various arms manufacturers to unlock the economies of scale necessary for our growing Republic. Through partial nationalization and state-guided mergers, the PSD government will ensure that our soldiers will never want for bullets or quality equipment."
 KOM_authdem_roads_across_russia_desc: "A nation without infrastructure is a nation in name only. Bereft of the connections that allow for commerce and travel, the country is divided, the people's concerns solely local. Russia was once far more connected than it is now; years of bombing and warlordism have caused a retreat, as citizens refuse to stray further from their immediate places of residence. Although there have been minor improvements as local governments build for their own purposes, much of the country remains far behind the Soviet era in this regard.\n\nIf Russia is to reemerge onto the world stage, the Republic needs to forcibly tackle this crisis. The revitalization of our road infrastructure will allow commerce to expand and fuel economic growth, as well as incalculably improving the lot of ordinary people through the expansion of work opportunities."
 KOM_authdem_an_economy_for_us_all_desc: "As economic improvement takes Russia into the modern age, we must be careful to avoid the concentration of increased material wealth into too few hands. The economy is growing particularly in urban areas, with the potential of leaving rural localities behind, and businesses often invest so much in improving physical capital and managerial salaries that they leave nothing for their citizens. As all of the veterans of Syktyvkar's turbulent political scene know, inequality causes resentment, which can and frequently does lead to political instability.\n\nKeeping wealth from becoming excessively concentrated naturally requires government action. Welfare programs, stringent regulations, and taxation on unscrupulous businesses should keep inequality in check, ensuring that Russia's prosperity is truly enjoyed by all."
 KOM_authdem_aid_for_the_agricultural_sector_desc: "Cut off from the outside world by constant turmoil, Russia's farmers have suffered long, difficult years. Between a general lack of feed, modern equipment, infrastructure, and customers, the agricultural sector has been squeezed from all sides. Without a steady influx of food from a strong farming base, building up a country is impossible. It is for this reason that agricultural aid is a necessity for economic improvement.\n\nThrough extensive subsidies, loans, and other forms of financial assistance, the government can revitalize the Russian agricultural sector, and not soon enough; as our growing cities teem with hungry mouths to feed, we need as much food as we can get."
 KOM_authdem_national_recovery_initiatives_desc: "The PSD has great plans for the rejuvenation of the Russian nation and people, but none of that will come to fruition without mobilizing the people for the cause. The government will establish sweeping programs for public works, industrialization, and defense construction to enlist the people in the project of rebuilding the Republic. Where private enterprise shies away, the people will step in, and the government will reward them for their labor."
 KOM_authdem_expand_rural_opportunities_desc: "A key characteristic of 'modern' society is the productivity of its agricultural sector, with machines doing the work of a hundred field hands in half the time. This is not to say that we disparage the work of the honest farmer; far from it! Most Russian farmers live hand-to-mouth, with antiquated tools and outdated machinery forcing a reliance on manual labor - oftentimes their own children, the future of our nation. We must invest in the means of agricultural production, subsidizing access to new technologies and labor-saving contraptions to improve productivity, ensure farming profitability, and give hope to farmers that they are working towards a brighter future."
 KOM_authdem_stimulate_local_businesses_desc: "While our detractors often charge that the PSD cares little for private industry in favor of a state-owned economy, nothing could be further from the truth. We recognize that we are not infallible or all-knowing. Private enterprise will always be more effective at identifying and meeting economic needs at the local level, far removed from the specific needs of the state in defense, infrastructure, and natural resources. We do not seek to control every aspect of economic life in the Republic; indeed, we encourage the people to embrace the spirit of competition, to have a vested interest in their own prosperity. In this regard, all the state should do is create incentives for the Republic's entrepreneurs to invest in the economy, and to provide access to capital for those who seek to start a business of their own."
 KOM_authdem_an_educated_populace_desc: "Every section of Russian society has been impacted by the long war, but none more cruelly so than its children. The new generation knows nothing other than poverty, danger, and upheaval. Even such a simple luxury as an education like their parents had is unattainable. The decline in educational levels is a slow-moving crisis that, if it goes unsolved, will cause a serious shortage of skilled workers in the years to come.\n\nBuilding, funding, and improving schools across the Republic is both the ethical and economical solution. It fulfills national development goals while increasing opportunities for millions. Nothing will signify Russia's slow but sure return to normality more than the masses of children filling classrooms for the first time in a generation."
 KOM_authdem_standardize_the_schools_desc: "As we embark on our mission to improve education, one sore issue sticks out immediately: curricula and educational standards vary enormously between schools across the Republic, as distance, inequality of resources, and a lack of communication between localities drive them further apart. Schools that do not adequately educate their students are scarcely better than schools at all, and the potential is great for a wide skill gap to develop between various regions of the country.\n\nMany of these problems stem from the lack of a widely penetrating central bureaucracy. The government can do a far better job at setting and enforcing standards than the disparate array of local educational arrangements that exist currently, and it must if the Republic's less advantaged children are to get a better lot in life."
 KOM_authdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc: "Rebuilding a country is the tireless endeavour of an enormous number of skilled workers, engineers chief among them. Without them, it would be impossible to erect bridges, lay down vast lengths of road, design military vehicles, or perform any other of the staggering variety of tasks necessary to keep a society running. However, engineers are of short supply in Russia, owing to a general diminishment in educational capacity, and there are far too few to satisfy the exponentially growing demand.\n\nIncreasing attendance in engineering programs is not just a matter of economics: it is a matter of national security. Through subsidies to private schools and the establishment of new public technical schools, the government can encourage the formation of a new generation of bright young engineers who will take their country to tremendous heights."
 KOM_socdem_the_russian_economy_desc: "The current economy is in a terribly bad shape. Much of what we once had was ravaged by German bombings twenty years ago, and the rest was destroyed by the Russian warlords before us. We will have to start a long recovery process if we are ever going to reestablish Russia as a dominant Socialist nation. Thankfully, our economic advisers are already formulating a plan to get us back on track."
 KOM_socdem_public_sector_investments_desc: "The public sector of any economy includes infrastructure, law enforcement, healthcare, public education, and other important services. Through this sector, we handle the essential services that every citizen in the Western Russian Free Republic may use (provided they pay taxes). Arguably, the public sector benefits everyone, and it is why we should put an emphasis on this part of the economy."
 KOM_socdem_lessons_from_the_reds_desc: "Several of our economic advisors believe that Lenin was once going in the right direction when he issued the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy in the 1920s. The Bukharinists shared the same ideas regarding a private sector-based development that would feed into a strong state-driven economy. Today, in the [ROOT.Getname], we have decided to try the 'capitalist turning into socialist' economic strategy and see how well it works. It could be that the Reds were correct in which policies work best for Russia."
 KOM_socdem_our_own_gosplan_desc: "When the Russian worker state was first established in 1921, the Soviets developed a Gosplan to handle the central economic planning of the young nation. The agency would maintain the Soviet economy until the Union's collapse in the face of Nazi Germany. We must develop our own Gosplan-esque agency to grow the young Republican economy. It must have the authority to coordinate both the state industrial development and our public works projects."
 KOM_socdem_rights_for_the_worker_desc: "We have seen throughout history the oppression that everyday workers faced. From Ancient Egypt to the Middle Ages-style serfdom to the grueling Industrial Revolution, common workers were just tools that were exploited by the middle and high classes. The Western Russian Free Republic has no need for this type of ruthless exploitation; workers' rights were an essential part of the DSNP's campaign, and they will remain our highest priority. When we develop and enforce our policies, we put the workers above everyone else, as they are the collective Atlas that holds this Earth in place."
 KOM_socdem_the_national_resource_directorate_desc: "Here in the Free Republic we have an abundance of different natural resources, but we cannot afford to use up all of them carelessly. We must develop an agency, the National Resource Directorate, to keep track of our natural resource supply and monitor its use. We can ensure that the resources will only be used to enrich the state and if they cannot be used, they will be carefully preserved."
 KOM_socdem_expand_the_key_facilities_desc: "Our large industrial facilities are precious to us; they often provide all of the manufacturing necessary to keep our economy running and our citizens working. We must work on expanding the large facilities we currently have, especially the industry in Izhevsk and Gorky. With improved factories and more jobs for our workers, our economy will certainly be strengthened."
 KOM_socdem_the_public_works_boom_desc: "Our careful policies have transformed a weakened economy into a quickly-developing one, with a strong base for additional improvement. It is safe to say that our economy is now one of Russia's finest, and it is all thanks to our public spending and infrastructure building. We must remember to thank our patriotic workers who have allowed us to establish this great socialist society, and it is through their craft that we are able to live prosperous lives in the [KOM.GetName]."
 KOM_socdem_private_sector_supplements_desc: "Our plan for a total economic recovery starts with developing a private sector so that our people can actively run businesses and generate a profit. Right now, we need an economic system that can work for the individual citizens of our country. If the private sector plan succeeds, we will have a stronger economic base that can transition smoothly into the socialist state we desire. The development towards socialism begins with a capitalist base, after all."
 KOM_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc: "One method we can use to spark our economy is inviting foreign enterprises into our country and permitting them to build factories. These factories will generate a profit for us and a profit for our network of partner companies. All we have to do is reach out to some of these large businesses and convince them to bring their manufacturing plants to Russia."
 KOM_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc_tt: "The §gPSD§!'s support base will §Roppose this measure§!."
 KOM_socdem_stimulate_local_economies_desc: "This economic plan requires the people to be the main source of income for the country. We can give jobs to our citizens by creating local building projects across the Republic, boosting the smaller economies. Once we raise the national standard of living and disperse wealth throughout, our socialist system will be able to manifest under our guiding hand."
 KOM_socdem_regulations_against_exploitation_desc: "When the general public is given power, it is our responsibility to ensure everyone is safe. Ever since we created the private sector, many privately-owned businesses have spawned, each with their own unique treatment of workers. More often than not, these businesses abuse the workers for their own corrupt personal gain, and it is time we put a stop to this cruelty. We must create nationwide safety regulations to ensure our workers are not exploited, and any private business that fails to adopt these regulations will be punished severely."
 KOM_socdem_an_educated_populace_desc: "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 KOM_socdem_standardize_the_schools_desc: "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 KOM_socdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc: "Russia has been destroyed by countless years of war and bombings. To rebuild it, we will need more engineers than ever before. Civil Engineers from all across the nation must be called to serve in new, large projects of building bridges, railways, and roads. Cities must be improved to support the health of the people and ensure services are met.\n\nUnfortunately, the current amount of engineers just won't cut it. If we want more engineers, we must teach more engineers. Universities will be persuaded to hold even more classes in Civil Engineering as well as helping bring additional people into the field. Soon, Russian cities will look even better than they did before all the bombings!"
 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_army_desc: "Our brave men in the field have accomplished a lot for us, yes, but we need to start bringing the Russian Republican Army to contemporary standards. The Germans, Japanese, and Americans all have top-notch militaries, and it is likely due to advanced tactics and modern weapons, neither of which we currently have. In order to restore Russian prestige, we must work to modernize the army and join the ranks of the global superpowers in terms of military might."
 KOM_democratic_lessons_from_the_last_war_desc: "Our most recent conflict, the West Russian War, was full of genius tactics and offensives issued by commanders on both sides. We must look back on what worked for us in that war, how we carried out combat and used logistics to conquer our enemy. We can't neglect our opponent's strategy to win the war either, as his forces often fought to the very end. We must adapt these tactics to our current military in order to grow stronger."
 KOM_democratic_study_foreign_strategy_desc: "To improve our military strategy, we need to look to the top armies of the world: Germany, Japan, and the United States. We must observe the swift German blitzkrieg across Europe, Japan's burning advance into China, America's brave defense of Scotland. Even the South African War had plenty of cunning tactics from both the United States and the German Reich, and they were carried out with the newest weapons available. Sometimes, foreign military strategies are the most useful."
 KOM_democratic_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc: "It was not long ago when Russia was still fractured into various warlord states, each with their own dreams and aspirations of unifying the Motherland. In some regions, chaos remains widespread; it was only through our military that we became the strong force we are today. There are many lessons that can be learned from the Unification Wars, including the tactics used to defeat insurgents and the military strategies behind the most successful warlords here in Russia."
 KOM_democratic_tactical_flexibility_desc: "Sometimes, our grand battle plans may be disrupted by unexpected, uncontrolled events; we cannot expect every war to be carried out perfectly. Instead of relying on one large battle plan, we should start focusing more on officer initiative: letting the individual commanders make the call based on the unique conditions around them. Because our overall command structures may break down, we might need to delegate the decision-making to the individual units on the ground. We must let each respective unit use the tactics that are best suited for their respective situation to win us the war."
 KOM_democratic_a_modernized_force_desc: "Though our Russian Republican Army is mighty within Russia, it does not compare to the contemporary forces of the three global superpowers. Many of our tactics and weapons are from the German-Soviet War over twenty years ago; it is time to bring the RRA to the modern age. We will renovate the army by increasing the military budget, investing in new military technologies, and exploring the most recent military tactics. In the end, the Russian Republican Army will become a Cold War-ready force to be reckoned with."
 KOM_democratic_the_ministry_of_defense_desc: "In the process of upgrading our military, it is imperative that we expand our General Staff to meet the new army standards. We will have to provide our generals with updated data from battlefields around the world and keep them informed about the latest military training methods. We must also streamline the Ministry of Defense bureaucracy in order to improve the effectiveness of our leading commanders."
 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_navy_desc: "Many years have passed since Russia had a navy she could be proud of. Over twenty years ago, the Kriegsmarine ravaged the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea during the Second World War. The time has come for us to establish a naval force like no other, one that will prove capable of destroying enemies at sea long before they reach land. We will start by expanding our shipyards, recruiting the best available sailors in Russia, and constructing the most up-to-date vessels."
 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_air_force_desc: "One of the most valuable lessons the world learned from the devastating Second World War was the importance of air superiority and close air support of ground troops. Unfortunately, the Soviet Air Force could not compete with the Luftwaffe twenty years ago; Soviet planes were often out-of-date, and pilots did not have sufficient training. We shall create a proper air force for Komi by building more air bases, recruiting top-of-the-line pilots, researching the latest models for fighters and bombers, and constructing powerful airplanes to wrest control of the skies and rain death on enemy cities."
 KOM_democratic_infantry_equipment_trials_desc: "Our soldiers require high-quality guns for use in the field, and unfortunately, all we have are World War II-era rifles and whatever left over from Zlatoust's merchants. We must hold trials and competitions to develop a new standard infantry rifle that can be mass-produced for our men. Better guns means more of the enemy we can kill to win the war."
 KOM_democratic_improve_on_the_armored_corps_desc: "The only available tanks we have are from the Second World War, and they do not compete with the armored forces of Germany, Japan, and the United States. If we are to make a swift advance and blast our enemies to pieces, we need to improve the quality of our tanks significantly. We will hold trials to see who can produce the most effective armored tanks that we can use for the army. Hopefully, the end result will be a tank that can compete with that of our opponents."
 KOM_democratic_reopen_the_vyatka_general_staff_academy_desc: "The Tsarists of Russia once had a famous academy that was used to train new officers for the General Staff, and it is time that we revive the academy. It will be used to pump out the best-of-the-best generals for our army and improve the officer corps. With effort, it could become one of the top military academies in all of Russia."
 KOM_democratic_strategic_supremacy_desc: "When it comes to war, weapons are only as good as the person handling them. Offensive and defensive tactics are only as effective as the commander issuing them. We must strive for the greatest tacticians in all of Russia and defeat our enemies through superior tactics alone. At the end of the day, it is our military maneuvers that will set us above our fiercest opponents."
 KOM_democratic_onto_the_world_stage_desc: "Now that we have become a regional power, it is time that we start reaching out to nations beyond Russia. To achieve this, we need to establish a proper foreign ministry and hire diplomats that can fully express our intentions to the world. Since we have become a contender for unifying Russia, the world has taken notice of our Republic, and we need to make our first appearance on the world stage."
 KOM_democratic_open_the_gates_desc: "Back when we were a smaller power, much of our trade was confined to Russia only. As a current regional power, we need to start branching out to other nations beyond the Motherland, especially the democratic countries around the world. Now that we have some coastal territory in northern Russia, it would be beneficial for us to establish a merchant marine operating around the White Sea, protected by a few of our ships."
 KOM_democratic_the_last_democracies_of_europe_desc: "With the rapid expansion of ideologies like fascism and National Socialism, it has become increasingly important for democratic nations to band together during this time of crisis. Essentially, we need to reach out for any European democratic hand we can hold onto, and we must appeal for diplomatic relations with these rare countries. Together, we will form a continental bulwark against the evil threat of authoritarian regimes."
 KOM_democratic_appeal_for_recognition_desc: "Even though we are a regional power in Russia, some countries still see us as \"just another warlord state\". Diplomatic recognition is the first big step in becoming a relevant world power, the defender of democracy we aspire to be. We must call upon nations like the USA, Iberia, England, and Italy, and convince them that we are a legitimate state and deserve diplomatic recognition."
 KOM_democratic_embassy_funding_desc: "Now that we have received diplomatic recognition from some major world powers, we need to establish official embassies in each country that recognizes us as a legitimate state. We will have to set aside part of our budget to maintain these embassies, but we will also enjoy full diplomatic relations with several leading nations. It is a small price to pay for a spot on the world stage."
 KOM_democratic_call_for_investment_desc: "Our treasury can only pay for so many of the projects we started to transform this country, and now is the time we look to foreign investment. Thankfully, we can negotiate a deal with the new countries that have recognized us. We can assure these countries that if they decide to invest in our Republic, our debts will be paid back tenfold, and every country involved will benefit."
 KOM_democratic_across_the_ocean_desc: "We already enjoy diplomacy with several European nations, but we must also look beyond our home continent for potential allies. Though North America is a distant continent, it serves as a pedestal for the last shining beacon of democracy left on Earth. We should seek to establish connections with Mexico, Canada, and the United States in order to gain more international recognition and more embassies on the western side of the Atlantic."
 KOM_democratic_a_visit_to_washington_desc: "Ever since our democracy was first formed in the ashes of the Soviet Union, one of our biggest diplomatic goals was to someday meet the President of the United States and discuss the global defense of liberty. [KOM.GetLeader], our own President of the Republic, would like to establish a meeting with U.S. President [USA.GetLeader] in Washington. We will take any opportunity to meet the wonderful American people, and if the proposed summit goes well, it will be another diplomatic achievement we can cross off."
 KOM_democratic_apply_for_ofn_observer_desc: "Though our current diplomatic status with the OFN is quite limited, we could use some foreign aid to continue building up our country. Our democratic government located in the middle of ravaged Russia should be enough to convince the OFN officials to grant us status as a prospective partner nation. It may be the first step on the road to becoming a proper defender of democracy like our American brethren."

The usual suspects are running fierce campaigns to make their way to the top, and as always, only one will become Russia's helmsman for the next few years.\n\nOf course, considering our current position as master of Western Russia, whoever wins the presidency is likely to go down in history as the one who finally made the nation whole again after nearly thirty years of strife.

However, the party has also been a consistently divisive topic, as Voznesensky has proven to be a problematic figure at even the best of times.\n\nA newcomer, Alexander Yakovlev, wishes to change the party's troubled reputation. He is now running a campaign based on ideals of democratic socialism, free from the mistakes made by the party in years past. Only time will tell if his bold promises will pay off."

 KOM_third_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc: "The DSNP, above all, serves the working class of the Republic. This is no reason to grow complacent, however, as the other parties are already seeking to encroach upon our most important base of support.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev already has plans to tour the industrial centers of the nation, and to publicly shake hands with the most influential workers' councils of our cities. With the councils on our side, we may have an easier time organizing future campaigns. Most importantly, however, this show of good faith will restore the workers' confidence in our party, and once again solidify our voter base."

 KOM_third_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc: "The DSNP has long been an advocate of democratic socialism, even during the days of the Voznesentsiy. However, certain compromises in these ideals had to be made to ensure better cooperation with the coalition to stem the tide of radicalism. Now that the storm has passed, the time has come for a new platform to reaffirm our commitment to socialism.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev has given the party the green light to make public this new platform, which is far more radical than anything we have seen before. It calls for a renewed push towards a democratic transition towards socialism, as well as a strict adherence to radical workers' rights policies. Women's rights, which were always present but never really the main focus, have been reemphasized as part of the party's goals. These policies may be seen as a bold shift towards the far left, but Yakovlev is confident that this new direction will revitalize the party for years to come."

It was a call by those who would see democracy preserved from the radicals, by any means necessary. Some in our party argue that our purpose has been served. No longer do radicals threaten to steal our freedoms. Instead, the officials of the PSD argue that we must look outward. Effective immediately, the party's platform for the upcoming election will incorporate a strong, pro-unification message. How the nature of Russian legislation will be left largely in the hands of local politicians. The focus of the national government will be on a massive rearmament program, which will improve industry, infrastructure, and provide employment to hundreds of thousands of Russians.

 KOM_third_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc: "Just across the A-A line lies our occupied homeland. Long ago, Bukharin's Soviet Union fell to the Germans and occupied the heartland of our country. Later, Vorishilov's West Russian Revolutionary Front tried to take it back, but the West Russian War and the Republic's independence led to the war's eventual failure.\n\nHowever, now we have an opportunity. While we can not invade the remnants of Moskowien right now, we can start to press the issue of the border to the general public. Troops will be sent to ensure the warlords who have emerged do not invade the Republic and Russian refugees are taken care of. We can not take back what is rightfully ours so long as our flank is exposed, but we certainly can make our case known that all of Russia, including Moskowien, is rightfully ours."
 KOM_third_election_the_SMR_campaign: "The SMR Campaign"
 KOM_third_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc: "It's election time once again in the Republic, and the Union of Young Reformers has a serious chance of achieving victory. Naturally, a winning strategy will require a winning campaign, emphasizing issues that Russia's voters see as relevant to their own lives and choosing popular policies in response to them. But, as the question always is, what to choose?\n\nRussia as it stands is backwards, uneducated, and globally isolated. It has been so for decades, and voters no doubt want things to change. Here is where the SMR can present its recipe for the nation's recovery: expanded investment in education, free trade policy so capital can flow into Russia once again, and the construction of robust ties to the Free World. May Russia's rise to global prominence mirror our rise in the polls."
 KOM_third_election_meet_with_the_youth: "Connect with the Intellectuals"
 KOM_third_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc: "The SMR's philosophy emphasizes the values of openness, humanism, and intellectual achievement. Unsurprisingly, this makes the middle classes and the intellectual elite natural bases for the party. Any successful campaign will involve mobilizing voters of higher status, whether material or educational, to the polls in order to beat the other parties' rabble, and voters don't simply turn out because of similar social class.\n\nThe SMR needs an effective infrastructure that can mobilize this base, and the best way of doing so is by meeting them where they are. Sending campaign officials to donors and universities will allow us to build the party's connections to voters just in time to shepherd them to the polls."
 KOM_third_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future: "A Platform for a New Century"
 KOM_third_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc: "Ivan Morozov was a very principled leader, and he helped raise Russia's new democracy from infancy. However, he still held onto obsolete ideals, elements of Russia's Soviet past; while his methods were liberal and democratic, his ends were socialist, even if they were less so than Voznesensky or the extreme left. This element of the SMR was already vestigial when Morozov was in office, and it is now time to move on.\n\nThe new platform will invoke our earlier ideals of freedom, both in speech and in markets, and of sensible international cooperation, while quietly abandoning Morozov's leftist sympathies. While some voters may be upset by the transition, others previously hostile to voting for a socialist should more than make up the difference."

 KOM_dsnp_socialism_for_the_people_desc: "Alexander Yakovlev is no stranger to ridicule - the majority of which, ironically, coming from those ostensibly most aligned with our policies. They accused us of some dreadful lacking for putting faith in the synthesis of Marx's theories and the market's temporary benefits.\n\nSerov believed we lack the vision to uplift Komi from its dilapidated state. Today [Root.Capital.GetName] and its neighbor cities bustle with cars in the day and shine with electric lights at night.\n\nBukharina believed we lack the interest to provide for the people's needs. Today every worker and farmer in our payroll enjoys benefits that would foment jealousy in their counterparts outside Russia.\n\nSuslov believed we lack the strength to exert power over our immediate neighbors. Today the Free Republic's flag flies in every government building west of the Yenisei.\n\nThe conclusion is self-evident: we distinguish ourselves from naive fools by proving our naysayers wrong. As the Republic's generals and diplomats secure West Siberia for Russia's rightful government, their doubting voices have returned - the past years were strings of flukes, or so they claim. Surely Yakovlev can't enforce his wishful thinking onto another large swath of land and its peoples.\n\nFor the revolution's sake, we shall prove them wrong a fourth time."
 KOM_dsnp_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc: "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Yakovlev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with [Root.Capital.GetName]'s finest."
 KOM_dsnp_strengthen_the_social_economy_desc: "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states. In this we will be assisted by a safety net strong enough to keep every citizen from experiencing the miseries they and theirs had scant years ago."
 KOM_dsnp_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "Everyday, prospectors drill holes in the middle of nowhere (or rather, in the middle of West Siberia) and drench themselves in fountains of sticky black gold. Powering cars, factories and homes worldwide, Earth's ancient ichor is in high demand - and the Free Republic has fields worth ten hundred billion barrels of it underneath our feet. We would be fools not to exploit them for our benefit.\n\nThe National Assembly has hence approved a bill establishing Gazprom, a state-owned company that shall soon manage the particulars of exploiting quite possibly Earth's largest reserves of crude oil. Oil wells, pipelines, employees - whatever they need, we shall provide. The revenue they will generate will more than recompense our treasuries' losses a thousandfold."
 KOM_dsnp_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc: "Wise men save their money while fools spend theirs towards, even beyond, bankruptcy. Wiser men, however, spend their savings on investments which generate money, ensuring that their total savings grow by the year. So do these men shield themselves from externalities while simultaneously enlarging their fortunes.\n\nA sovereign wealth fund applies wiser men's logic to a nation-state's scale. Managed by financial experts, it receives money from the government and funnels them as principal towards well-earning stocks and bonds. Both principal and interest may then be utilized for whatever higher purpose the fund is bestowed.\n\nFor the Free Republic, and its generous influx of oil money, that purpose is securing every registered citizen a comfortable life even when they are old and infirm."
 KOM_dsnp_a_fruitful_reunification_desc: "With West Siberia's last warlord vanquished, the Free Republic now stretches from Gorky to the River Yenisei. It is tempting to make haste and immediately fulfill our preordained right to rule over all Russia, yet we must not stray from our primary mandate - that is, the betterment of the peoples whose lives we affect through the Assembly's laws.\n\nFor now, we shall expend much of the government's attention into integrating our new citizens into the liberties and comforts West Russia enjoys. Wanton conquest can wait until the Republic's citizens, old or new, live the fulfilling lives we have promised them."
 KOM_dsnp_staff_the_bureaucracy_desc: "Bureaucracy grows as the state does; should the latter grow twice its size overnight, then the former grows twice also. Both could be said for the Free Republic at present now that West Siberia is ours. Unfortunately, our sudden dearth of bureaucrats has led to issues in applying [Root.Capital.GetName]'s ordinances past the Ural Mountains.\n\nIn response, President Yakovlev has directed his advisors to recruit more bureaucrats not only from West Russia, but also from West Siberia. The pencil-pushers under our old adversaries' employ will be of great use to their new government soon."
 KOM_dsnp_answer_the_autonomy_question_desc: "Ethnic groups such as the Nenets and Selkups have inhabited northern Russia since before Yermak subjugated the Khanate of Sibir. Centuries of oppression under the Tsar followed, then decades under old Bukharin, until Barbarossa shattered the rusted grip that held their leashes. Pressing circumstances had up until now prevented us from doing more than granting autonomy to the enclaves that remain. Operative phrase: up until now.\n\nCertain members of the National Assembly have proposed legislation that, if passed, would turn the natives' autonomies into self-governing protectorates - independent nations in all but name. Whether or not it does pass will decide what place our Republic has for Russia's many non-Russians."
 KOM_dsnp_approaching_the_dawn_desc: "On the outskirts of Syktvkar, a farmer tests his new tractor in today's harvest. He reaped more wheat that day than in a month with his old sickle and trowel.\n\nIn Omsk, gray concrete bunkers explodingly give way to housing complexes with windows, curtains and balconies: features once dismissed for showing too much to enemies that can neither be seen nor grasped.\n\nIn Gorky, the morning air comes alive with searing heat, struck hammers and steelworkers' song. With the city fathers' leave, its sprawling assembly plants are now put to task building automobiles the common man can afford.\n\nSlowly but surely, leisurely but successfully - Russia steps out of perpetual dusk. We will feel sunlight's kiss again."
 KOM_dsnp_lessons_from_the_sibplan_desc: "History remembers Nikolai Bukharin as a man of many plans but scarce time. His vision for Russia and her proletariat died with Moscow during the Great Patriotic War, and so we can only speculate its specifics. Gosplan nevertheless gave some of it form in the days of NEP, namely Siberia's manmade transfiguration into an industrial powerhouse. The hence-named Siberian Plan's aftereffects lay in the winding railroads and teeming industrial zones dotting the region's halves.\n\nMuch of the megaproject's documents - blueprints, manifests, progress reports - has survived the Warlord Era's complications. We would do the Republic's economy today and tomorrow well by applying their lessons in raw material-rich yet industrially-poor regions like the Kazan."
 KOM_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_desc: "While specializing regions by the resources they possess does maximize their use to the national economy, it also unevenly distributes the state's wealth as a consequence. The end result thereof is a nation comprised of two parts: poverty-riddled cornucopias and towering islands of industrial growth. Who services which needs no elaboration.\n\nThus, the Yakovlev administration's economic advisors have drawn plans to build a network of cities, with their factories and skyscrapers, from Arkhangelsk to Zlatoust. Our results shall prove to the world that the Free Republic has no place for unequal societies."
 KOM_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_tt: "§YInvestments§! shall be made across §Rdisadvantaged regions§! to increase §Geconomic parity§!."
 KOM_dsnp_a_hand_to_the_west_desc: "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises."
 KOM_dsnp_flying_together_desc: "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World. Already cooperation's fruits have ripened in both ends of the Atlantic: Arkhangelsk's tonnage figures have multiplied several magnitudes since, while American industries now partake on Russian materials for the first time in decades. With what it has offered, our relationship with the superpower seems set in stone.\n\nPerhaps now is right for expanding this relationship further.\n\nPresident Yakovlev has penned a request for observer status in the OFN, in exchange for granting most favored nation status to its members. This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 KOM_dsnp_onwards_to_the_future_desc: "Four times have our fellow socialists derided the methods we abide. Four again have results bade them peace.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Yakovlev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor. With the people in lockstep behind him, the President seeks a bright future to leave them with - a worthy crown to his party's legacy.\n\nAnd what adornment shines brighter than Russia reunited?"

 KOM_smr_reorient_kibersin_desc: "Project KiberSin has been bearing fruit in Western Russia. The data received from the computers has proven invaluable in advancing our economy onto the world stage. However, currently our KiberSin infrastructure is limited to Western Russia, and we now have annexed a large amount of territory that is in desperate need of economic recovery programs.\n\nIn order to make the Western Siberian economy more efficient and more effective, our President has proposed for increased funding to be allocated to Project KiberSin, and for additional KiberSin offices to be constructed in key locations across Western Siberia. Not only will these offices help open up much-needed job opportunities in these recently incorporated territories, but they will serve as a prime opportunity to re-orient some of KiberSin's priorities in a more modern and consumer-oriented direction. With additional capital investments in the program, Project KiberSin may, instead of adhering to outmoded etatist principles, serve as a means of developing our domestic technology market and increasing domestic communications capacity."
 KOM_smr_subsidize_energy_concerns_desc: "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. With the inheritance of these regions, however, we have nationalized many concerns on a provisional basis. In order to ensure an efficiently managed energy sector, these provisionally state-run energy concerns shall be privatized and placed in the hands of firms which demonstrate responsible practices and a commitment to effective management. Creating private-sector jobs in the energy industry will do wonders for the economies of the newly-integrated Western Siberian region, and ensure significant growth potential in the years to come. In addition, generous subsidies shall be provided to these concerns whilst this process is underway, to prevent shocks to the market causing a disruption in our energy supplies. Whilst costs may be higher short-term, the long-term potential present shall make this investment pay off in time."
 KOM_smr_invite_international_capital_desc: "As a developing nation, despite its size, the Free Republic has much to offer prospective foreign investors. Specifically, our abundance of natural resources and ongoing projects to allow for market-oriented development and investment opportunity in the energy-sector.\n\nTo build capital and ensure a timely development of our nation's economy, selling resources on the international market at fair rates and entering domestically-produced products into the international market via eliminating needless trade barriers should be carried out without delay. Additionally, foreign investors shall be invited to Russia, to tour our cities, resource deposits, and growing native industries. An influx of foreign capital shall invariably follow, lifting our people out of poverty, developing national infrastructure, and improving quality of life en masse."
 KOM_smr_a_fruitful_reunification_desc: "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people.

 KOM_smr_approach_the_siberian_liberals_desc: "Despite the recent integration of Western Siberia, the various administrations of the region have not disappeared. While some of the politicians are far too dangerous to allow into our democracy, especially considering the tumultuous history our Republic shares with extremists. However, some of these administrations are filled with sensible enough people.\n\nBoris Yeltsin, a politician from [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk], has been a democratic advocate for some time now, and we welcome him and his colleagues with open arms. Similarly, the liberals of Zlatoust can be relied upon for political support. We shall be discussing with these factions, and we can use their recommendations for various bureaucratic positions in our new local governments. Of course, we shall also be ensuring that SMR politicians find their way into the most critical roles of these governments, to ensure these governments are ultimately aligned with our values."
 KOM_smr_reestablish_the_siberian_republics_desc: "The old Soviet Union made many mistakes, but we do not need to dismiss all of its decisions with the same broad brush. Specifically, the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, which helped provide representation to the various minority groups within the Soviet Union. Western Siberia is home to many minorities, and our Republic should aspire to ensure these minorities receive the same level of equality and autonomy within our system as they possessed in the old Soviet system.\n\nOur President wishes to recreate these Siberian ASSRs, although modified to better fit our government's structure. With the Siberian Minority Representation & Autonomy Act, several Autonomous Republics will be carved out of Western Siberia, and staffed with various ethnic and religious minorities that require greater representation within our democratic system."
 KOM_smr_crafting_our_future_desc: "When Pyotr Alekseevich became Peter the Tsar, he inherited a backwater from his father Alexis and brother Fyodor. Its cities hearkened the Kievan Rus' in their antiquity and bucolia. Its laity lived almost to a man as illiterate peasants and serfs. Its nobles and generals ruled their fiefdoms like free boyars, rather than subjects of an Imperial Majesty. Lesser men would be tempted to leave the state of things be; after all, what use was there changing an unstoppable force's course?\n\nBut Peter proved himself above and beyond men as concept altogether. By his decrees were our greatest cities willed into existence. By his tutelage, the evolution of peasants into intellectuals, craftsmen, clergymen. And by his ironclad will, seditious subjects and rapacious rivals alike humbled before the twin-headed eagle. The emperor's passing completed Peter the Tsar's metamorphosis into Peter the Great: guiding light and model for all Russians, regardless of ideology.\n\nIt is his footsteps which we had followed yesterday, are following today, and will follow tomorrow. History repeats in cycles - and as sure as the world turns about itself, so too shall Russia repeat the reforms which blossom sun-kissed sunflowers from its all-encompassing wastelands."
 KOM_smr_expanding_university_funding_desc: "The quality of life in Russia is beginning to rise, and our economy is doing well. With increased prosperity comes increased demand for a skilled workforce, and to obtain these skilled people, we need to educate the people. Unfortunately, university-level education has not been a high-priority for Russians ever since it collapsed into anarchy. Our President shall be increasing the funding reserved for universities and higher education.\n\nIncreased university funding will also aid our research endeavors, replenish Russia's academic scene, and it is the next step in advancing our nation to the modern age. Russian thinkers shall once more share their knowledge with the world."
 KOM_smr_new_conservationism_desc: "A core part of Russia is her beautiful, unending nature. The Union of Young Reformers has always stood for protecting the environment, as it is humanity's duty to be the stewards of this earth. With Western Siberia's beautiful forest, tundra, and mountainous landscapes now under our control, we must ensure that these beautiful lands are not butchered by industrialists and the greedy. Of course, our mission is made more difficult by those who governed Western Siberia before us. Tyumen and Omsk, their environments decimated and polluted by the policies of Kaganovich and the Black League. We must clean up their mess, and protect what's left."

Our Republic must make itself worthy for public support and ensure a strong, sovereign Russia that is by the people, for the people. Only then can we unite with our rivals and stand against the Nazi menace."
 KOM_psd_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc: "Currently, one of our biggest problems lies in our infrastructure. Even though our predecessors treated this land well and gave it life, there is still much more we can do to build this country up. For now, we should focus on restoring infrastructure and improving our cities to develop a strong core.\n\nNot only will our land development allow troops to move faster, but it will keep our population well-fed, a quality that not many Russian warlords have for their people."
 KOM_psd_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc: "Our Republic currently suffers from internal strife within the general population.

We now have plenty of oil to sustain our military and provide a surplus to our citizens.

Through this, we could give a little extra power to the energy sector of our Republic."
 KOM_psd_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc: "Our economy is in need of a sovereign wealth fund that can be used to properly develop Russia.

It is our job to ensure the Republic is safe from the domestic extremists."

We all must work to bring the blessing of human liberty to the entirety of what was once the oppressive Soviet Union."
 KOM_psd_encourage_local_democracy_desc: "The federal government always seems to have the greatest concentration of power, but it is the local government where the people's voice is best heard. Local administrations are much better suited to tackle local problems than the federal government, so we should encourage the people to participate in their regional elections. The most important changes often come from elections at the lowest level of democracy."
 KOM_psd_a_framework_for_popular_involvement_desc: "We need to come up with a plan to secure our democratic ideals in case something unfortunate happens in the next elections.

That way, the PSD agenda will be diffused among the population where it could counteract a potential PSD loss in the elections."

To start, we need to extend more diplomatic overtures to the OFN and let them know of our intentions."
 KOM_psd_the_twin_eagles_desc: "Our relationship with the OFN has been rather minor, as they still view us as a smaller force within the vastness of decayed Russia. We must send our diplomats to attend meetings with OFN affiliates if we are ever going to increase our diplomatic status with the organization. It would also benefit us to invoke the National Sovereignty Act in order to gain an OFN defensive guarantee. Through these first maneuvers we will improve our relationship with the United States and, like two soaring eagles, we will fight to the death to ensure democracy for all the struggling people of the world."
 KOM_psd_onwards_to_the_future_desc: "In this term we have accomplished many of our goals, both foreign and domestic. We worked with our resource departments to improve the economy, we worked to shatter the authoritarian influence at home, and we worked to better our relationship with the OFN. One major goal remains: we must fight to bring all the Russian people together under a banner of freedom, of life, liberty, and prosperity. It is during this term that we will unite all of Russia against the wicked Nazi influence that demolished the identity of Russia long ago. It is time for the Free Republic to start her final offensive."

 KOM_stalina_the_reconstruction_of_russia_desc: "The Reconstruction Government now controls all of Western Russia, with the recent annexation of Western Siberia. However, Western Siberia is marred by terrorism and the aftermath of extremist regimes. Tyumen's Communist Party and the Black League need to be hunted down and exterminated. Once that is done, we can build a decent administration in the region, that will facilitate our eastern expansion. It will be hard work, but President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are used to hard work at this point."
 KOM_stalina_securing_the_peoples_faith_desc: "The people of Russia need something to trust, something to keep them safe, something to support. We need to show them that we are the party of strength, stability, and national pride. We need to secure the people's support, because without it Russia will surely fall to extremism. Therefore, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved increased production of propaganda, and bribing off every semi-important public figure we can find. Once the people are surrounded on all sides by praise, they will have no choice but to support the Reconstruction Government."
 KOM_stalina_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc: "With the Reconstruction Government facing some dissent from its populace regarding the ever-expanding military, and the lack of democracy in our government. To combat this, President Stalina has suggested the allocation of some funds to the expansion of our nation's social welfare. There are two advantages to this decision: It pleases the populace and gets them to stop protesting against our administration's structures and policies, and it strengthens the nation as a whole. It will solve our most pressing problem, and aid us in the long term. A wise course of action, although it will limit the size of our budget."
 KOM_stalina_escalate_the_national_defense_projects_desc: "President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have come to a decision: the national defense projects must be expanded. Large projects such as American-style highways, repairing damaged infrastructure, and other such plans will produce large numbers of jobs, combatting the unemployment problem within our nation. We shall also order the Russian states to expand their defense economies, lifting some of the strain of economic management from the central government. This will also hopefully soothe the populace, who had been growing somewhat discontent as of recent. These actions shall strengthen our nation and prepare the Motherland for what's to come."
 KOM_stalina_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. While some private enterprises are already making moves to establish their domination over these markets, we must ensure that our nation's oil production is handled efficiently and effectively. If we can harvest our own oil supply directly, we will be able to fuel our military at a much cheaper cost. As such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern in order to efficiently manage the oil industry and ensure the efficiency of the nation's energy sector. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs. Using this firm, our government should be able to expand our oil reserves and use the profits to fund projects that give back to the people."
 KOM_stalina_establish_the_russian_sovereign_welfare_fund_desc: "The Reconstruction Government has a lot of plans for the Motherland. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds to put these plans into action. However, the National Reconstruction Council has come up with a solution to this problem. With approval from President Stalina, the National Reconstruction Council has greenlit the creation of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nThe Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund is a state-owned investment fund, the money coming from the nation's banking reserves and our annual revenue. The wealth from this entity will go directly to the Motherland and her people. This will allow us to fund the development of infrastructure and improve our citizens' lives in other, more direct ways. The Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund should be relatively risk-tolerant, so it also is a fairly safe decision. The National Reconstruction Council sees no reason to delay its creation."
 KOM_stalina_a_hand_towards_the_east_desc: "The Reconstruction Government has reclaimed and integrated Western Siberia into the Republic, but our work there is not yet concluded. Lots of work will be needed to raise the region to our government's standards of development. Once we do that, the people of Western Siberia will be able to have the same confidence in our political institutions as the rest of our citizens.\n\nOf course, our work in Western Siberia will not be peaceful. Extremists from Tyumen's Communist Party and Omsk's Black League have continued to fight guerilla campaigns, attacking our soldiers and our civilians. These terrorists need to be hunted down and eliminated, for the safety of the Republic. The scars left by Western Siberia's extremists will heal with the passage of time."
 KOM_stalina_break_the_hidden_circles_desc: "While their regimes have fallen, the extremists continue to thrive in secret. Despite our best efforts, members of the Black League and the Communist Party have slipped through the cracks and infiltrated our state. The Background Disclosure Act requires all former members of either organization to disclose their past membership. This information will henceforth be made available to the public, so that they can't suppress the truth. Anyone who refuses to disclose their membership and is revealed to have been part of either extremist organization will be arrested, and charged with conspiracy."
 KOM_stalina_the_yekaterinburg_commission_desc: "Currently, our temporary military administrations in Western Siberia are both understaffed and under-prepared for governance. These temporary structures were supposed to be just that, temporary. However a lack of trusted bureaucrats led to our government struggling to form proper, permanent administrations.\n\nTo combat this, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved the formation of the Yekaterinburg Commission. This commission's duty will be to locate administrative candidates within Western Siberia and rehabilitate them. While these candidates and bureaucrats may have worked for extremist regimes, the Yekaterinburg Commission will determine which candidates can be expected to abandon their radical ideologies. Once enough positions can be filled, a proper administration will be established in Western Siberia."
 KOM_stalina_redefining_politics_desc: "It has become clear to our nation, that ideology is a corrupting force, radicalizing those who follow these ideals. Instead of simply weakening ideology, we should focus on prioritizing pragmatism in our governance. All of Russia needs to learn to push ideological conflict aside, and accept our shared values: Freedom, Sovereignty, and Pragmatism.\n\nPolitics should revolve around these shared values, and shift towards simply solving problems without considering how these problems fit into greater ideological frameworks. Politics at their core should be utilitarian and unbiased. The best way to destroy extremism is to instigate this cultural shift, and sway the people to our side."
 KOM_stalina_the_toolbox_theory_desc: "As President Stalina continues on her quest to divorce politics from ideology, she has adopted the Toolbox Theory. The theory is very simple: politics and political processes are tools used to solve practical problems. Rational people do not throw out the toolbox and resort to extremism to solve problems, such behavior merely causes new problems to appear. Instead, the answer to all problems lies in our political institutions. All we need to do is use them properly, and use them wisely."
 KOM_stalina_a_foundation_for_the_future_desc: "Once the government is stable, extremism is destroyed, and the Motherland united, it will be time to dissolve the Reconstruction Government. In its place, free and democratic elections will commence, and we will have institutions in place to ensure this.\n\nThe elections will be modeled after the Komi Republic's system, the President elected directly via ranked-choice voting, while the Vice-President is appointed by the National Assembly after the elections. The unicameral legislature will have two-year election cycles, while the President shall be elected every every four years, and there will be no term limits for both the legislature and the Presidency. The Komi Republic's problem was its kow-towing to extremism, not its government structure."
 KOM_stalina_answer_the_eagles_cry_desc: "The key to Russia's future is the OFN, and they are going to be our most important partners as we prepare to unite the Motherland. As such, we need to attempt to obtain increased status within the OFN. This would allow us to attend meetings of OFN-affiliate nations, and acquiring a defensive guarantee. To acquire this guarantee, the National Sovereignty Act can be used as leverage, since the United States is always willing to work with those who provide them the economic incentives to do so. With America's guarantee, the Motherland's bright and prosperous future will be ensured."
 KOM_stalina_look_to_challenges_ahead_desc: "The Reconstruction has accomplished a great deal, and now Western Siberia is fully integrated into our Republic, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead that we must face. However, with the combined power of our strength and our principles, we can move forward. We can unite the Motherland. We can bring stability to her people. We can turn the Motherland into a titan, ready to avenge her humiliation, and liberate Moscow and her citizens. We can achieve all of this, and the Motherland will finally be free from the shackles that extremists placed upon her."

We must move first, for this Republic must not falter.\"\n\nConcluding her speech, silence fills the room for but a brief moment before thunderous applause reaches her ears. It seems her message has gotten through.\n\nSvetlana Stalina, a devoted new politician, has quite quickly climbed the byzantine ladder of influence in the Komi Republic, and her messages of anti-revolutionary zeal and revenge against the German menace that plagues the fields of Russia has resonated with at least a sizable portion of the masses. Now, she has become a major political asset in the ever-so complicated political field of Komi, and even opponents of her have come to concede it."

They lurk in the darkness, awaiting their opportunity to strike at our foundations and collapse the structure that has held this nation together. We cannot wait! We cannot wait for them to enact this evil plan! We must make the first move - and battle them through any means necessary.\"\n\nAlthough the sounds of applause filled the chamber almost immediately from Stalina's portion, hushed whispers and glances dominate the rest of the group. The measures Svetlana puts forward are extensive, and involve different varieties of actions against 'enemies of Komi', such as further powers of the ruling party of the legislative chamber, the ability to carry out arrests without warrant of said enemies, and some rumor that, outside of the legal powers, Svetlana will further fund her allied paramilitaries in order to help control the nation. Whether that is true or not, however, does not matter. Svetlana has already made her move."

The meetings, too, show a great change in mood: the whispers grow in number, the applause grows less certain, the glances become only more and more worried.\n\nThe leftist paramilitaries, too, show bizarre behavior.

The presence of trouble is in the atmosphere - and the reasoning is not difficult."

To the followers of Voznesensky, however, it seemed like Russia would be reunified before the break would be finished. Discussions in hushed tones dominated all sections of the chamber, but nowhere did it happen more than in Voznesensky's section. As the break reached its end, Voznesensky rose up from his seat and made his way to the podium.\n\n\"Morozov, your plan of action in this chamber do not help us, the party, or the Republic. What you are suggesting is only dividing us further, and constitutes as creating your own alliance with Miss Stalina. I officially condemn your statements. That is all.\"\n\nWhile some applause rang out, the majority of the Deputies reacted in silence.\n\nAs dusk approached and the session wrapped up, Stalina and Morozov stayed behind in the room. Their words few, but their motivations plenty, it was agreed on with a simple handshake. An alliance to protect each other, and to serve the Republic - through whatever means necessary."
 KOM.5.a: "Let's hope it isn't needed."
 KOM.6.t: "Unity, for Now"
 KOM.6.d: "After the session and Morozov's controversial speech, two stayed behind in the legislative chamber.

By the time they finished, it was already near-midnight. However, following a final, genuine handshake, the negotiations were complete. In exchange for Morozov retracting his statements, Voznesensky would, at a later point in time, send through measures that were more effective. Both men came out of the meeting satisfied, as their party would remain strong - strong enough to withstand any coming political storm."

As he spoke, Voznesensky became interested, and as the wheels in his head turned and turned, became perturbed. Although the politician's words were not important, his affiliation was. His mind raced, and his eyes began to take on a knowing glow. One name appeared in his consciousness, again and again.\n\nZhdanov.\n\nIt was a secret. For now. Confined only to a group of a few people. But if it ever got out - Voznesensky shuddered. Just imagining Morozov's reaction was enough. Then again, Zhdanov was an immeasurably precious asset to him, and if he needed his help, he would get dead air in response.\n\nThe politician finished his words. But he was not focused on the next generic speaker. Voznesensky had to choose..."

The leaked documents detail the extent of the connections, highlighting the relationship between Zhdanov and Voznesensky and showing the amount of collaboration.\n\nThe Voznesentsi has been completely shattered by the news, as highly tempered debates run wild in the meeting minutes and legislative sessions following the story being broken.

Without anyone knowing, he had slipped out of Syktyvkar during the dead of night, indeed - he arranged it on an official 'private outing' for the next few days, and he thought, at least, no one suspected the wiser.\n\nThe waxing gibbous and a flashlight was the only sources reflecting on his face, yet on his soul reflected much. But his resolve was clear. He must not let this come to light. Otherwise, too much would be at stake.

This one, however, struck the party nerve to the limit. The anonymous source has not slumbered, as new documents and evidence are leaked daily to the Party and the public. Suspicious of Voznesensky due to him not testifying and seeing less of a necessity politicians loyal to him grow fewer by the day.\n\nIn addition to this, rumours have surfaced of even further ties to Zhdanov, to the point where both men would be comfortable with each other in a meeting, swapping jokes as a socialist revolution is plotted. While these are only rumors, they have still dented the reputation of the party, and threaten to destroy entirely the relative internal peace within the legislation chamber."

The evident loss of trust in Voznesensky within some sectors of the party continues to manifest itself, until a screech drowns out the arguments and brings order once again to the room.\n\nHolding his microphone, Voznesensky continues. \"Now. These rumors are false, yet they damage us. We cannot allow the source of these rumors to continue shrouded in darkness. An investigative committee must, and will be formed. This investigation will encompass any suspected spreader of these rumors.

While some offered resistance and admitted themselves, most kept quiet, regardless of their true affiliation.\n\nAfter the arrests were made, Voznesensky made his way to the podium. \"Friends of Komi, we can no longer tolerate foreign agents, spies, and traitors in our ranks. This is not the end. More of Suslov's spies are watching us right now. Any so-called Voznesentsi of mine will be subject to further investigation to ensure they are truly loyal to the Republic. That is all. You are all dismissed early for the day. Remember where your loyalties should lie.\""
 KOM.17.a: "How many could there be?"
 KOM.18.t: "Svetlana Urges Caution"
 KOM.18.d: "After the events of the previous session, the democratic Deputies were in a state of hysteria. Accusations flew like never before, hostility was palpable, and all worried about the ties of even those persons sitting right next to them. The loss of unity in the party troubled Svetlana Stalina, and not articulating her own thoughts on the situation would be a grave mistake for the party. After a politician's speech on \"destroying the Suslov agents\", Stalina took her turn to speak.\n\n\"Distinguished Comrades. The situation that has developed in this room does not play to our advantage in the slightest. Instead of questioning the circumstances that led to the documents being leaked, you all assume that the leaker is somewhere in this room, right now. I beg of you to consider this alternate option: the leaker, as he is called, has not, in fact, leaked anything. Rather, it is an organized plan by our enemies - a plan to destabilize our precious democracy by framing someone who has not done anything wrong with crimes against the state. I should know this, because that's what I would do.\"\n\nLoud mutters filled the chamber at this point, with all eyes weighing up Stalina in disquiet. \"I believe that this could be a conspiracy, a conspiracy that will send us crashing down in flames. Please, think about it.\"\n\nThe murmurings in the chamber eventually ceased, and some token applause was offered. Most, however, were worried by Stalina admission that a conspiracy as they feared was not beyond her means. Perhaps it would be best not to think on it too deeply."
 KOM.18.a: "Ironic."
 KOM.18.b: "She isn't wrong."
 KOM.19.t: "A Plot!"
 KOM.19.d: "The committee members were sure of it. Right there lied the evidence, the proof needed to end this debacle once and for all. A Voznesentsi politician by the name of Nikita Yakovich has been accused of orchestrating the release of documents to the public, as well as spreading rumors that damaged the reputation of Voznesensky himself. Confident in their work and relieved that this emergency may finally come to an end, all but one headed out to begin the proceedings.\n\nHis original purpose was to take one last look at the documents, to oversee his vision for the case: start to finish, the evidence complete. But as he glanced over the document, a detail caught his eye. Didn't it say Yakovich and Zhdanov meet in Yb, where no one would notice yesterday? But this interview here with Yakovich's secretary said he was in the office the whole day. And this detail here is incorrect... and that one... and...\n\nThe committee member widened his eyes. In their haste, they had made basic errors in finding the leaker. The evidence that did implicate him was planted - a set-up. Rushing out of the door, forgetting his hat, he desperately went out of the room and into the night, hopeful to find any way to halt the proceedings... before an innocent man is punished for a crime he did not commit."
 KOM.19.a: "Can we stop it in time?"
 KOM.20.t: "A Smoking Gun"
 KOM.20.d: "\"Nikita Yakovich, your attention. Deputies, to attention.\"\n\nWhen the news spread that the leaker that had caused much tension and damage to the democratic coalition had been found, the politicians lit their torches. Following a midnight raid by police on Yakovich's home, seizing him in a state of sleep and reading to him his charges in a courtroom, he was personally sent on Voznesensky's orders to the legislative chamber in order to assure his party that all was well, and that the troubles would be over.\n\nAs Nikita repeatedly pleaded his innocence, to no avail, Voznesensky pointed to the trembling man. \"This man - a traitor of the Republic and a spy for Suslov - is the man that has caused us great suffering in our legitimacy and in our Komi! Shame onto this man, for he is the leaker - and the evidence has been gathered to prove it!\"\n\nAt an undisclosed location, an advisor speaks to one Mikhail Suslov on the news. A slight grin creeps onto his face, his eyes alight with the feeling of yet another pawn moving forward. \"Excellent.\"\n\nVoznesensky took stock of the situation in front of him. He had already privately dismissed the charges against him in court. No, no, the court would not do. He would deal with him personally. But in which way?"
 KOM.20.a: "Expelling him will be sufficient."
 KOM.20.b: "Call Yuri. Send a message to the rest."
 KOM.21.t: "Blackmailing the Problem"
 KOM.21.d: "Nikita Yakovich had enough common sense to realize something was amiss. His trial was dismissed. While the police were always nearby, they did not take action against him. While the politicians jeered and glared at him, he was still allowed to conduct limited political duties. It did not click, however, until the night of his retirement.\n\nThe chorus of glances, whispers, and outbursts declaring him an enemy of Komi that had been the drawl of a legislative session had concluded. He was tired and miserable, like the days before, ever since he had been accused of crimes against the state. Arriving at his home, relieved that it had not been destroyed by a German bomb yet, he sat down on his living room chair and lit the fireplace.\n\nA knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. Opening it, he was surprised by the man standing before him: Nikolai Voznesensky himself. \"I have come to have a talk with you, Nikita. \"With no other choice but to invite his guest inside, Yakovich gestured towards him to take a seat beside him at the fireplace. Both men sitting, Voznesenky went straight to the point.\n\n\"Quite clearly, Yakovich, your crimes against the state have been appalling to the rest of us. And it would be a shame if something were to further ruin your reputation. Like these pictures, for example...\" Yakovich's skin turned a pale white. How did he get those...? \"The way I see it, Nikita, you have two options. The first is the merciful one. You will resign from your post as Deputy at once. Or... you can tell your wife - \"Yakovich capitulated, agreeing to his demands. The political career of Nikita Yakovich was now over."
 KOM.21.a: "Just what he deserves."
 KOM.22.t: "Nikita Yakovich Found Dead!"
 KOM.22.d: "The Deputy sat in front of his fireplace. His tea boiled, and his watch read half past eight. Looking around, a figure stood in front of him-\n\nA flash. A bang. A thud. Nikita Yakovich went dead silent.\n\nNews from Syktyvkar today, as alleged leaker of damaging documents related to Voznesensky has been found shot dead inside of his home. The Deputy's watch was reported to have stopped around dusk, and according to the autopsy, appeared to have died immediately from two bullet wounds, one to the head and the other to the heart. However, despite the gruesome shooting leaving a mark on the public consciousness, there is still no evidence of the identity of the killer, nor if there was a motivation behind it. It seems another senseless killing has plagued our Republic...\n\nVoznesensky laughed at the news report. Yuri had done his job well, as expected. His immediate payment would include a bonus, even! He was feeling generous today. The leaker is dead. And that is what mattered."
 KOM.22.a: "He will not be missed."
 KOM.23.t: "The Innocent Verdict"
 KOM.23.d: "\"He wasn't there that Thursday, Nikolai. That's the only thing that needs to be said and our whole structure of power could come tumbling down.\"\n\nThere were very few times in his life that Voznesensky had been genuinely shocked. Not since the fall of the Union has a realization hit such a poignant note in the politician. This man was innocent. Free of crime. No evidence that holds up. And he had put him out of his job.\n\nNews today reports that the murdered politician, Nikita Yakovich, alleged to be the leaker of state and personal documents, has been declared innocent of all charges. Already, protests have begun to be dispersed by Voznesensky-aligned paramilitaries, and the legislation is determining on their next course of action.\n\nVoznesensky was at a crossroads. He had to do something. But what?"
 KOM.23.a: "An innocent on our conscience."
 KOM.23.b: "Retract the story!"
 KOM.24.t: "Voznesensky, in the Presidium, with the Hit Squad!"
 KOM.24.d: "A verdict has been reached in the death of one of our former delegates, and the man who gave the order to have him killed.\n\nFar from what we originally expected, Yakovich was innocent, a victim of one of Suslov's plots to tear down our coalition. Our own Voznesensky, however, had plenty of warning to the contrary. Both Ivan Morozov and Svetlana Stalina have testified against him in our own internal court, stating that he had ample warning that Yakovich was innocent, and the evidence didn't quite line up. Despite this, he went on with the kill order anyway, and had Yakovich buried in a shallow grave.\n\nThe internal opinion of the Party has shifted radically away from the disgraced Voznesensky, and closer to the ascendant Morozov and Stalina - the right-center coalition containing our most experienced, and most importantly, less rampant, politicians.\n\nFar from standard procedure, this is an act of murder, and one that sets a dangerous precedent. His penalty shall be a vote of no confidence, and, if cast down from his chair, full legal processing at the hands of his replacement."
 KOM.24.a: "You should have listened, Nikolai."
 KOM.25.t: "The Vote of No Confidence"
 KOM.25.d: "Voznesensky stood before the podium. One hundred and ninety nine faces looked upon him, some with mixed feelings, most others with hatred in their eyes.\n\n\"Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. You have been charged, with substantial evidence, of high crimes against one Nikita Yakovich, and against the Komi Republic. As a result, a vote of no confidence will be levied against you, and a replacement shall be nominated if the vote passes.\"\n\nVoznesensky started to become drenched with sweat. He had rolled the dice, and he had gotten snake eyes. The question of his survival as leader now was ever-so-present within the nation and the National Assembly. Would he last?"
 KOM.25.a: "Out with the old?"
 KOM.25.b: "Out with the old?"
 KOM.25.c: "Out with the old?"
 KOM.26.t: "Deprecated"
 KOM.26.d: "Voznesensky looked down at his feet. The vote for confidence in him was about to begin, and as he reflected upon himself, he still believed that his policies were still best for the nation. He hoped that they would understand that.\n\n\"By a vote of one hundred and sixteen to eighty-four, the National Assembly has declared that you are in no confidence to lead this assembly any longer, Nikolai Voznesensky. Now we begin the process of voting for your replacement. Good day. Take him away, guards.\"\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, an unexpected candidate, Alexander Belozerov, has been voted in as President! A conservative politician, Belozerov was never the type of person to be cast into the spotlight, instead diligently representing the small center-right wing of his party. However, a combination of previous Voznesensky supporters, having more in number than expected during the no confidence vote, deciding to vote for Belozerov out of dislike of either Morozov or Stalina, as well as the Stalina and Morozov blocs devolving into fighting between each other, thus making them unable to unite behind a single leader.\n\nWhile Belozerov, in his acceptance speech, claims he will unite the Republic and bring order to the congress, many Deputies, even those within his own wing, see him as an ineffective choice for President, and such a President may even allow for something as drastic as the fall of democracy in Komi..."
 KOM.26.a: "A new name to learn..."
 KOM.27.t: "Morozov Inaugurated as President!"
 KOM.27.d: "Voznesensky gazed at the ceiling, not even bothering to see the expressions of his comrades. Did it matter who supported him at this point? What was the point if everything he worked for was ruined? All he could do is await his verdict.\n\n\"Nikolai Voznesensky. By a vote of one hundred and sixty-nine to thirty-one, you have been removed from office effective immediately. Security will now escort you out. Have a good day, sir. The voting for your replacement will now begin.\"\n\nThe choice for President has been decided: Ivan Pavlovich Morozov, a well-known economic mastermind and representative of his liberal wing of the democratic party, accepted his new post today as the President of the Komi Republic. Vowing to steer the Republic without influence of the more radical ideologies inside of it, his experience and age has made him an ideal pick for those seeking stability and democracy after Voznesensky's fall from grace. While he is slightly more right-wing than Voznesensky, his desire to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi still beats. The legislation has reacted rather favorably to the news, with plenty of applause being present during and after his acceptance speech. It seems a new dawn of democracy has shined on the Komi Republic."
 KOM.27.a: "A change for the better?"
 KOM.28.t: "Stalina Inaugurated as President!"
 KOM.28.d: "Voznesensky wore the scowl on his face proudly. How dare those traitors throw him to that horde of angry politicians? After all he did for this glorious republic. They should all be ashamed of themselves, and this republic will fall to the ground because of them.\n\n\"The hands that call for his removal are... one hundred and forty-three... the hands that oppose are fifty-seven. Voznesensky, by the voting of this National Assembly, the government of the Republic has expressed no confidence in your leadership. Your replacement will be voted on now. Security, escort this man out.\"\n\nIt is official: Svetlana Stalina has been made President of the Komi Republic. Managing an upset victory, her acceptance speech pledged that any threats to the order of the Republic would be annihilated, and that democracy shall flourish under her watchful eye. While most of the chamber reacted to her speech with cheers and applause, very strangely, some of the Deputies with closer ties to Stalina were reported to have looks of worry on their face. Whatever the reaction is, however, there is no doubt about it - the Republic has a new leader, ready to steer the country to greatness."
 KOM.28.a: "Let's see how she does."
 KOM.2800.t: "Voznesensky Endures!"
 KOM.2800.d: "Voznesensky, stoic, gazes blankly at the roof of the chamber. Here was a man disgraced by his own comrades. Here was a man who had lost his sense of morality. Here was Nikolai Voznesensky, leader of democracy in Komi - but, perhaps, not for much longer. The party will decide his fate.\n\n\"The time has now come to vote on confidence in comrade Voznesensky's leadership. If you are in favor of comrade Voznesensky, please raise your hand now.\" As the hands were raised, some politicians glanced at each other. Whispers broke out within the legislative groups, and worried looks appeared on faces throughout the room. Voznesensky perked up, his eyes narrowed and his heart pounding.\n\nMore amount of hands were showing than he thought. Perhaps even half of the chamber!\n\n\"And... if you are in favor of removing comrade Voznesensky from his position of power, raise your hands.\" The Deputy in charge of counting was perplexed. The margin was very narrow, but it seems no one voted twice... and democracy was democracy.\n\n\"Nikolai Voznesensky... by a vote of one hundred and three to ninety-seven, you have been declared still fit to hold this position of office...\" Uproar immediately broke out throughout the chamber, only silenced by the incessant banging of the gavel. Voznesensky felt weak. Somehow... he was still the President. Even though by a thread, loyalty and confidence in him was still present. Nikolai resolved himself. His job was to lead the Republic. And so, he will."
 KOM.2800.a: "How does he survive?"
 KOM.29.t: "Discrediting the Leakers"
 KOM.29.d: "\"Overwhelming firepower. That's how we'll destroy these leaks. If the damned Germans were able to destroy the Union with it, I'd say it would work well here.\"\n\nThe meeting continued on after that suggestion, but it seemed no other idea resonated as greatly. The leaks had damaged the democratic party's reputation, and fast solutions were needed in order to try to stop the ship from completely sinking. A giant media blitz is proposed as the answer - the propaganda machine will never stop turning, and it must not stop - otherwise, the leaks may doom our chances of survival.\n\nEach and every leak will be analyzed and discredited, providing some sort of evidence that the document contains falsities and lies. And so, we shall churn out our great campaign - to defend democracy. Of course, some may say that all these fact-checks are untrue, even within our own party... but these naysayers wouldn't want their own files to be left out of the analyzation process, after all. All will be in agreement."
 KOM.29.a: "Truth? It does not matter."
 KOM.30.t: "The Party Fades"
 KOM.30.d: "The analyst looked, and looked again. No matter how many times he analyzed the figures, success was simply not there. The discrediting process was supposed to work, wasn't it? They said this was a bright idea... and yet these numbers say otherwise. Should he burst the bubble? He thought about it a bit. Despite his fearfulness of consequences, he figured that the party deserves to know the truth - no matter what it says. He called his supervisor over and showed him the paper.\n\n\"We have a problem. This poll given to us by an analyst shows our support is dropping. Not by a lot, mind you, but still enough to be concerning. I've already fired him, of course, but it is still something we have to pay attention to.\"\n\nThe meeting attendants looked at each other with an amount of worry. Voznesensky, the chair of the meeting, responded back.\n\n\"These numbers do not show anything significant. It is indeed a temporary setback, but it's not like the Germans are invading Syktyvkar. We will debate how to fix this - if you all believe that it needs to be fixed - in a legislative debate tomorrow. Meeting adjourned. Stop wasting my time with this crap.\""
 KOM.30.a: "A small price to pay."
 KOM.31.t: "The Popularity Debate"
 KOM.31.d: "As the gavel banged and the session began, all eyes shifted to the candidates selected for debating the course of action on the declining poll numbers, and what to do to fix them. With each party in the coalition all holding their own positions on what to do in this situation, the debate was guaranteed to be a long and intense one. Each candidate, as per debate custom in the chamber, was asked to begin with an opening statement describing what they would do to fix the declining support of the democratic parties among the people.\n\n\"The fact that we are having this debate at all is a sign that the coalition has become full of worriers and defeatists,\" the DSNP candidate begins. \"Numbers like these go up and down all the time. One dip does not mean we must make a crisis out of it. Next person, please.\"\n\n\"Democracy is virtuous - but it is fragile, when faced with extremism and growing disregard for the very foundation of our Republic.\" Stalina comments. \"It is constantly under siege from those who wish to destroy it. Radicalism is the enemy of our Republic, and only God may know what these radicals will do if they are granted access to our leadership positions. We must not allow concessions to these fascists and communists, in the name of preserving our homeland from hatred and tyranny. That is all.\"\n\nIt took barely a second for Morozov to reply in kind, staring down at the audience. \"Thank you. Stalina is correct that we must safeguard ourselves against the radicals. However, not all of the radicals are unshakable in their beliefs. I believe that if we speak to the more democratic socialists, for example, and the less authoritarian rightists - the uncommitted citizens who have been unfortunately waylaid by impossible promises - we may be able to draw them into support for democracy. My statement is done.\"\n\nAs the figures began their debate, the observers watched with interest, some taking notes. However, they could only choose one winner of the debate. They believed that..."
 KOM.31.a: "Voznesensky is correct."
 KOM.31.b: "Morozov has the best argument."
 KOM.31.e: "Stalina presents the optimal solution."
 KOM.32.t: "The Voznesentsi's Solution"
 KOM.32.d: "As the debate concluded and the regular - albeit mandatory - applause filled the room, the democratic delegates were asked to select a 'winner' of the debate on slipping popularity numbers.\n\n\"Comrades of this assembly. Now is the time to count these votes, and determine the actions of this party in regards to the numbers crisis.\"\n\n\"By a margin of thirty-five, Comrade Voznesensky's plan... or rather, the lack of one,\" he muttered under his breath, \"...has been passed.\"\n\nVoznesensky's ideas were simple. If there is no action needed, there is no problem. Polls are simply that: polls. The numbers will always move back and forth, and there is no reason to assume that this will change. If the nature of the polls do not change, then there is no reason to change anything. And after all, if there is no action needed, there is no problem. Democracy would go on, and Komi would be blessed by the continued rule of the democratic party. All from not overreacting to one stupid poll."
 KOM.32.a: "Let's hope it works."
 KOM.33.t: "Soyuz Molodih Reformatorov's Solution"
 KOM.33.d: "The applause echoed across the chamber. The debate was over, and now was the hour for choosing what exactly must be done to save the democratic parties from losing their grip on Komi, before it was too late.\n\n\"Comrades, the vote will now begin. Please vote for the candidate you agreed for the most. And not the person you would die for, please.\"\n\nWhile the last part was whispered to himself, the voting process commenced.\n\n\"By a margin of forty, Comrade Morozov's plan will be put into motion.\"\n\nIvan Morozov is a rational man. While he believes that democracy will always have its hardcore opponents, he also knows that some of those who simply question democracy may be convinced, through certain methods, to reconcile with the democratic parties. Morozov's plan involves less harsh anti-radical measures than Stalina's, and also tries to recapture those who are closer to democracy back. Polarization will be stopped, and the poll numbers will return to normal - maybe even higher - levels. Under his hand, democracy shall reach salvation."
 KOM.33.a: "Let's hope it works."
 KOM.34.t: "Demokraticheskiy Vybor Rossii's Solution"
 KOM.34.d: "Following the debate and usual applause that came with its end, the delegates were asked to vote on the 'winner' of the debate, and in turn, decide the plan that would end the falling popularity of the democratic party.\n\n\"Delegates of this dear republic, it is now time to begin our voting for this debate's winner. Decide and cast your vote now...\"\n\nThe delegate's inflection was one of uncertainty. \"The leader of the vote, by... a margin of twelve, is... Comrade Belozerov?\"He couldn't hide the confusion from his face.\n\nNo matter what the reaction was to his plan, Belozerov was one to stick to it. In his view, while radicals on both sides of the spectrum were a threat to democracy, his belief was that the leftist socialists and communists would be much harder to defeat. The only way to break them was to work together with the right. With his negotiations, Belozerov can cause the right to ally with him, thus having enough influence and power in order to take down the left. This would drastically improve democratic poll numbers, and would also secure democracy against the leftist threat. Once the leftist threat was defeated, Komi would be free."
 KOM.34.a: "Let's hope it works."
 KOM.35.t: "Stalina's Compromise"
 KOM.35.d: "After Stalina spoke her closing statement, the clapping of hands - albeit a little forced - echoed in the room. The debate had concluded, and now, the delegates had to make their choice on the course that the party must take to combat falling poll numbers.\n\n\"Comrades of Komi, the voting process for the winner of these debates begins now. Please cast your votes.\"\n\nAfter a moment, the moderator looked at the box. It wasn't even close.\n\n\"By a margin of forty-seven, Comrade Stalina's plan has been passed.\"\n\nStalina is a woman who was determined to defend democracy. In her view, Komi can only be saved if the enemies of democracy were to be struck down before the radicals could strike and destroy the foundation of the Republic. Anti-extremist measures will be passed, further democratic-oriented \"citizen's informational media\" will be published and spread, and certain orders will be given to paramilitaries in order to secure the democratic control of republican-aligned districts. Each and every method needed to safeguard democracy will be applied, with full effort and full power behind it. And, with this, in her eyes - the Republic would be saved."
 KOM.35.a: "Let's hope it works."
 KOM.36.t: "A Message from Zhdanov"
 KOM.36.d: "The letter was a simple message. Near the Gribnoy Pereulok, eleven thirty in the evening - sharp. Bring a briefcase. Comrade Zhdanov. Voznesensky scratched his head. Sure, meetings were secret between the two - that much was obvious. His briefcase, however, he would have to find. But that shouldn't take too long...\n\nLights were scarce in these troubled times for Syktyvkar. There were enough aerial problems in the day, after all. The imposing silhouette of the Gribnoy Pereulok shadowed over the dark alley he was assigned to meet him at. Right on cue, a figure shows. Comrade Zhdanov has arrived.\n\nThe conversation was short. \"I have for you something that might be of interest to the democratic party. Take these.\" He shows Voznesensky why he needed the briefcase: papers, and plenty of them. All stamped with the seal of the Communist Party of Komi."
 KOM.36.a: "You're welcome... comrade?"
 KOM.37.t: "Taking the Internal Files"
 KOM.37.d: "Zhdanov glances at Voznesensky as the papers ruffle and shake to the movement of the breeze. The leader of the Republic did not hesitate as he took the files and inspected them. The first document, however, did not promise much. It was essentially a list of names of important, non-rank and file members within the Communist Party, something already known to him. Was this intelligence junk? Other papers were in the pile, of course, but if the first document that was shown to him was obvious information, then hopes were minimal that the rest of them were any better. On the other hand, these files were still important pieces of information, even if copies or already deducted. Surely, keeping backups would be important..."
 KOM.37.a: "What could go wrong?"
 KOM.37.b: "We've seen this one before..."
 KOM.38.t: "The Informational Arsenal"
 KOM.38.d: "Walking to his residence, Voznesensky swung his briefcase in his dominant hand. While these files were probably still worthless, it was good to check anyways; they can be used as future reference quite well. As the man went to his home, he stopped at the door and put down the briefcase containing the files. Another stack to put in the archives, he supposed.\n\nLighting the house and, out of paranoia, checking to see if anyone was peering at him, Voznesensky set down the case and opened it. As he saw and, perhaps expected, the first file was something already known: a name list of important figures of the Communist Party of Komi. No specialities. Settling himself in for a long night of bureaucracy, he flipped to the next page - an inventory of armaments in a depot outside of Syktyvkar. Blinking, he almost went to the next page before he stopped himself. He stared at the page - was this a prank? Was this even official? Yet... there was the seal of the Communist Party, and a stamp that marked it as top secret. This information wasn't junk.\n\nIt was a goldmine.\n\nQuickly flipping to the next page, wondering if it was new or old, he saw the title. 'Operatives Monitoring Democratic Activities:' This was certainly new, and was also a small shock. Why would Zhdanov...? No matter! Voznesensky had the tools he needed now to defeat the left: their names and weapons, cataloged and able to be weaponized to the fullest extent. He dialed a number on his telephone and rang - \"Grigorenko. Come to my house immediately. I have something that might be of interest to you.\""
 KOM.38.a: "Perfection!"
 KOM.39.t: "Better than the Others"
 KOM.39.d: "Voznesensky thought about what Zhdanov was offering him. Sure, they were internal files of the Communist Party of Komi. But Zhdanov was not a man who he completely trusted. And considering that the first file was nothing but already-known junk, he did not have high hopes for the rest of them. Even if they were files that revealed damaging information, what would he be then? Just another plotter in the shadows? Komi has enough of those already. He would become another Gumilyov, or Suslov, and his followers would be known as Voznesenskyites to even his own party. He knew that a couple of old and worthless files was not worth losing party unity for. No matter how he put it, there was no way to justify taking these documents.\n\n\"Zhdanov, comrade. I apologize, but there is no point in me taking these documents. They do not help me at all. Thank you for your consideration.\" He awaited Zhdanov's next words."

 KOM.41.d: "Zhdanov looked over at Voznesensky, retracting his hand and putting the documents away. The two men locked eyes, yet Voznesensky did not see the Zhdanov he usually saw. Avoiding eye contact and looking around, Zhdanov muttered out a few words, perhaps of gratitude, or of regret - but Voznesensky could not tell - and slowly backed away from him. Was Zhdanov planning something, and his plot was now defeated before it even started? Did Zhdanov want to sabotage his party and he stopped it from happening? Could he possibly be even hurt emotionally by the rejection - a close friend betraying him?\n\nAs Zhdanov quietly phased out into the darkness, Voznesensky was left alone with the stars to contemplate."

 KOM.42.d: "A little after the clock struck twelve did the call come in. Voznesensky grabbed it with no haste, expecting yet another legislative matter, or perhaps an associate clearing up a request. Repayment was not on his mind, however, when he picked up the phone.\n\n\"Comrade Voznesensky, this is Andrei! I hope you have obtained the material and kept it safely.\" Voznesensky didn't expect the call, but that was fine. A small chat with Zhdanov about the materials, in fact, would be a wise thing to do. \"Indeed, I have! Thank you, Comrade Zhdanov. Now, our meeting-\" He was interrupted by Zhdanov's next words. \"Ah, Nikolai, yes, our meeting. Speaking of that, did you think that I would just give you the documents for free, old friend?\" Voznesensky was silent after that, wondering just what he signed up for. \"You see, Nikolai, there is a certain organization that has been talking to me. They say that they are being hunted down by your paramilitaries, in fact, and would very much not like to be hunted down by your paramilitaries. Now, Voznesensky, I am aware that you do have the power to fix this, correct? And that I also expect to see it fixed. The All-Komi League of Socialism and Communism would love to know they can sleep safely at night. Thank you, Nikolai.\" Before Voznesensky had a chance to reply back with any word, Zhdanov hung up. Now it was his turn to fulfill the end of the bargain."

 KOM.421.d: "「同志オプレスニン……」電話は途切れた。かつてクレムリンのホールから派遣されていた議員は決して慣れることがなかったが、これはスィクティフカルではよくあることだった。困り果てたジダーノフは、もう1度かけた。「同s……」2回目の電話は、前回よりも早く終わった。ジーダノフは、官僚が上司に書類を要求するために数少ない回線が混み合っている午後に電話をかけたくはなかった。しかしこの問題は先送りできないほど重要だったので、もう一度ダイヤルを回した。「同志オプレスニン……」\n\n「同志ジダーノフ、君だったのだな、私の古い友人よ」\n\n電話の向こう側には疲れた老人が立っていた。彼は最近めったにダーチャ（邸宅）から出てこないが、過去数十年にわたり共和国軍の半分以上の戦闘を経験した人物であった。オプレスニン将軍は、ジダーノフの電話の意図を理解していた。しかし、彼はもう自分が戦力になるとは思っていなかった。彼の人生というものは、自分の大隊を前線に導いて誇りと努力を持って進軍させるも、単に敵の大砲によって引き裂かれるだけに終わるということの繰り返しだった。彼ほど戦闘と苦痛と栄光に疲弊している者はいないだろう。しかしその時、ジダーノフの手によって授けられた壁にかかっているレーニン勲章が彼の目に入った。そして彼は思い出した。\n\n革命の勝利は、それを十分正当化できる唯一の偉大なものであろう。もしロシアが労働者の手にゆだねられることによって報われないならば、すべての戦いは彼自身を含む多くの人命の無駄遣いになってしまうだろう。弁証法的な議論が続いた後、将軍は電話の相手に望まれている答えを返した「同志ジダーノフ、私の命は党の手の中にある」\n\nニコライ・オプレスニンはクローゼットから古い制服を取り出し、きちんとした身なりを整えた。兵士に戻るなら、それに相応しい心構えが必要だ。彼の最初の戦いは参謀本部に電話することだった。\n\n「ニコライ・オプレスニン将軍、職務に復帰する」"

 KOM.422.t: "Nighttime Suspicions"
 KOM.422.d: "It was the dark of night when Pyotr Grigorenko, the Republican military's Chief of Staff, telephoned Svetlana Stalina. He had deliberated about the call for some time, worried that she would be disturbed from sleep, and thus unreceptive to his imperative.\n\nHe need not have been. Barely one ring had passed when the call was answered, and the voice all in the Republic knew well answered him decisively. Like himself, Stalina was most active during the nighttime hours, finding them free of distraction and an optimal time to accomplish work. Equally aware of her disdain for wasting time, he got right to the point.\n\nNikolai Oplesnin had been appointed to the Republic's General Staff. His General Staff. And he was most concerned. The man was both qualified and proficient, true, but that was not his worry. Oplesnin's past was. It was impossible to overlook his activities under Bukharin's regime and, thus, his potential ties with the WRRF.\n\nGrigorenko was both surprised and heartened by Stalina's immediate agreement. She shared his concerns, particularly those concerning the absolute necessity of preventing communist infiltration of Republican state organs. Oplesnin had to be watched, closely. They, therefore, quickly came to an agreement of coordination.\n\nIf only the Republic as a whole could be so decisive as Stalina was, Grigorenko thought as he replaced the receiver."
 KOM.422.a: "Keep a close watch."
 KOM.43.t: "The Chaos Increases"
 KOM.43.d: "The irregular sound of pistol shots and yelling helped set the tone for the meeting. Voznesensky, Malyshev, Grigorenko, and all of their associates were discussing the latest news: an uptick in street violence between left-wing and right-wing paramilitaries. Since more blood had been spilled onto the streets, the democratic party has been conducting meetings between them and their paramilitaries to see what should be done about this situation.\n\n\"This is the perfect opportunity!\" Grigorenko yelled, slamming his fist on the table in a display of masochism. \"These idiots are fulfilling their blood lust against each other, and draining their numbers! If we go out into the streets now, then we should be able to destroy them all!\" \"Why the hell should we risk injuring our fine men if they're injuring each other already?\" Voznesensky replied back. \"They'll just start using more drastic methods, maybe even killing each other. No need to deploy anything.\" \"You two, as usual, assume that we have to do either everything to stop them, or nothing to stop them. Have you ever considered simply helping move the process along? Escalating the situation? Do certain actions and blame them on the opposing ideology? Strike from the shadows? These are the kind of things we need to do in order to succeed. Think about it.\"\n\nAs the screaming and the gunshots continued, the meeting wrapped up, a decision finally being reached."
 KOM.43.a: "One should not interrupt their enemy in the process of making a mistake."

 KOM.44.t: "No Need to Panic"
 KOM.44.d: "Huddled civilians cried and cowered in the shop. Outside were dead bodies, two associated with the left and five associated with the right. Blood stained the street and sidewalk, glass and weapons lying at the feet of the deceased. A new era of chaos in the streets and towns of Komi rules over the Republic now.\n\nVoznesensky smirked at the news of the most recent confrontation, this time resulting in an unusually high amount of deaths. He was right after all - there was no course of action required. Now, they are killing each other directly in the streets, when before they had only injured each other. The process is happening even quicker than he thought. Soon, the problem would be eradicated completely as the paramilitaries wipe each other out. He sat back in his chair, enjoying the supremacy of his decisions. Nothing to worry about from here on out."
 KOM.44.a: "The problem solves itself."
 KOM.45.t: "The Shifting Tides"
 KOM.45.d: "Voznesensky did not see the changing of the situation at first. It was a slow process, a slogging ordeal for both combatants that left some dead and many more injured on both sides alike. But now, reports have come in from the democratic paramilitaries and the citizens of Komi. More and more, the injured and killed come from the right-wing paramilitaries - they appear more scared as they go to fight, less of Gumilyov's men show up to confront the leftist forces, and Gumilyov himself has been rumored to be in a state of disarray following a decisive defeat in Vilegodsk in which his forces have been completely driven out of the city.\n\nWhile fights are still ongoing in Syktyvkar, and the left-wing paramilitaries still suffer many casualties, it is now clear that the balance is tilting towards Suslov and his armies in the streets, which may prove to be a challenge in the future. But for now, Voznesensky pays it no mind. The right will come back from this minor setback, surely."
 KOM.45.a: "Concerning..."
 KOM.46.t: "Red Stars on the Poll Booths"
 KOM.46.d: "He was blindsided by the news. He couldn't believe any of it. How were they able to do that? How...\n\nThe leftist radicals have declared victory in the streets. Following a particularly gruesome battle near the legislative building in Syktyvkar between Suslov's elite paramilitary unit and cobbled together volunteers of Gumilyov's forces, in which the winner was obvious, the rightist paramilitaries have showed up less and less. Gumilyov, for now, has been defeated in the paramilitary struggle, and although his forces fight on, none are sure he may ever be able to regain the strength he once had again.\n\nVoznesensky, upon hearing this, was about to burst into one of his characteristic tyrades when another piece of news hit: voters were now being intimidated by these paramilitaries. Electoral districts have shifted control from more democratic-leaning to fully leftist-leaning, and some communists have even had the audacity to graffiti red stars onto the polling booths, letting all who vote know who is nearby. Shifting, wanting to speak, wanting to explode onto the news bringer violently, he found that he couldn't. Wearily sighing, he simply waved the courier out of his room."
 KOM.46.a: "How could it have gotten so far?"
 KOM.47.t: "Embracing the Moderates"
 KOM.47.d: "\"The poll numbers are up, for once.\" Yet another meeting, yet another piece of news. At least this piece of news was pleasant. Voznesensky blinked and asked him to explain how this could happen when the radicals were about to stage their 'fair' election victory.\n\n\"According to... well, a survey, yes, I know it's a survey, but just stick with me. According to that survey, many of them are people who are newly supportive of democracy. It seems after the violence was started by the radicals of both the left and the right, the moderates of both wings became terrified that they would be targeted both by the enemy and within their own ideology. Thus, they now flee to us for their safety and protection.\"\n\nVoznesensky was at least glad that he might have a chance of surviving these next elections. Speaking some token words of approval he couldn't bother to remember, the meeting carried on."
 KOM.47.a: "Something good comes out of this."
 KOM.48.t: "The Shifting Tides"
 KOM.48.d: "The changing of the balance was something unnoticed at first. Yet, as time continued on, something seemed more apparent. Rumors were that Suslov had been showing up less and less to his meetings. The battles have gotten bloodier, the left-wing in particular becoming more desperate in their fighting methods. Apparently, the left-wing paramilitaries are being beaten back on the streets, with some fighting apparently even happening in fully communist-controlled areas.\n\nVoznesensky fidgeted at the news. While he knew that fighting would still go on for a long while, as the left is very equipped and powerful, it did not ease him to know that the right wing, with Gumilyov at the helm, is growing ever-more powerful in the outside world, away from the chambers of power. However, Voznesensky had faith in the left-wing paramilitaries. Surely, they will beat Gumilyov back, and kill each other. Surely."
 KOM.48.a: "Concerning..."
 KOM.49.t: "Springtime for Gumilyov?"
 KOM.49.d: "Voznesensky could not believe what he heard. How was this possible? How did they do it? How...\n\nIn the streets of Syktyvkar and the small towns of the Republic, the rightist paramilitaries are supreme. After an intense and hard-fought battle between Suslov's reservists and Gumilyov's elite, SS-modelled bodyguards, of which the winner was clear, the leftist paramilitaries have retreated from the streets, only showing up to protect certain key electoral districts and influential leftist figures. Although Suslov fights on, and with still much power to eventually wreak havoc on the right, Gumilyov has gained the advantage in the battle of Komi.\n\nVoznesensky began to cuss out the poor courier when he realized something. If Gumilyov has already taken control of several communist districts, that means he is very much able to intimidate voters in those districts, as well as democratic districts. In a 'fair' vote, Voznesensky would be defeated. Cursing out the carrier as much as he could, he knew that the end could be near for him."
 KOM.49.a: "How could it have gotten so far?"
 KOM.50.t: "Peace Through Superior Firepower"
 KOM.50.d: "Grigorenko grinned as he saw the beautiful T-34. An old relic of the wars of Russia, yet still an effective killing machine, the commander was proud to say that this tank was now part of his paramilitary - and would drive the radicals out.\n\nWhen Voznesensky approved, reluctantly, Grigorenko's suggestion for equipping and sending out his paramilitaries to fight, he immediately went to work on preparing his forces for the battles ahead. New drills with new rifles. New tanks to crush the Suslovites and the Gumilyovites with. New powers to destroy the enemies of democracy.\n\nAs the orders were given to begin engaging fascist and communist paramilitaries, Grigorenko personally led his forces to the streets of Syktyvkar, ready to fight. Ready to win."
 KOM.50.a: "Do us proud."
 KOM.51.t: "A Cordial Request"
 KOM.51.d: "Voznesensky's work was interrupted when one of his secretaries entered his office. The stocky man nodded toward his boss and wordlessly made his way to the desk. \"From Zhdanov\" was his underling's only comment. Voznesensky did not bother to look up from the memo as the secretary closed the door behind him.\n\nZhdanov's message was polite. The cordial word to the President of the Republic succinctly made a case for the end of targeted paramilitary campaigns against the communists. For reasons of military security as well as to prevent radical elements from destabilizing the left. It would not do, after all, for communist citizens in Komi to see the government turn its back on them. Nor would it do any good to have brave communist soldiers gunned down by the government.\n\nVoznesensky's eyes were still on the memo when his underling brought his afternoon tea. Deep in reflection, the politician thanked his secretary, but did not lift his eyes off the message."
 KOM.51.a: "Why would we?"
 KOM.51.b: "Let's try it, at least."
 KOM.52.t: "A Propaganda Surge!"
 KOM.52.d: "A leaflet among many, distributed it in mass the last few weeks. \"Where were you citizens, when the bourgeois government made open its ties to fascists and reactionaries?\"\n\nThe leaflet fluttered down the street. The wind's whimsy brought it under a new propaganda poster. A brutish soldier stood poised to stab worker militiamen from behind. From the soldier's shadow, a twin hydra of fascism and conservatism. \"The so called democrats have always been threats to the workers' revolution. End the massacre of brave communist patriots!\"\n\nAfter admiring his printers' handywork, Zhdanov rolled up the window of his car and asked his chauffeur to drive on. Better stay off the streets in these troubled times."
 KOM.52.a: "Damnation!"
 KOM.53.t: "Suspicions within the Party"
 KOM.53.d: "The population did not know why the violent campaign against the communists had started. Neither did they know why it had ended suddenly.\n\nReports coming in from the democratic party made it clear that the general population's confusion was replaced in the government by dismay. Internal memos trying to assess where the order had come from. Centrist Apparatchik apparently clued in rapidly that the order had come from the top, and a few ill advised conversation over drinks had been dutifully recorded by Suslov's men. Suspicions that Voznesensky had capitulated to the left were corroborated with a few bribes given to key military men of the regime. Making sure of loyalty in tough times? Many governmental paramilitaries would have been incensed to see their prize taken away.\n\nSuslov read the final report before neatly adding it to the pile. The socialist leader was intrigued by the whirlwind of violence and capitulation. He pondered if Zhdanov had made himself useful for once, and stopped the violence against the left. Only time would tell."
 KOM.53.a: "Another trap!"
 KOM.54.t: "Silver Bullet Holes"
 KOM.54.d: "A fresh crop of political violence was harvested today in Komi as the headquarters of several radical paramilitaries of all political affiliations began burning down today. The string of fires broke out in a rapid succession, overwhelming Komi's fire department. The buildings had not yet stopped smouldering before manifestations broke out against the arsonists. The protests turned ugly when the crowd could not determined who had really been behind it. In between helping with the fires and quelling riots, quite a few law enforcement officials lost their lives to the chaos. Their funerals will run concurrently with those of a range of paramilitary leaders and soldiers, lost to the blaze and smoke. Ordinary citizens of Syktyvkar have not been spared, for fire and hatred both spread easily in such a large city."
 KOM.54.a: "The only upside..."
 KOM.55.t: "The Smoke and Mirrors"
 KOM.55.d: "Pyotr Grigorenko is a man with a plan. In his city, thugs and drifters with no clear ambition join paramilitaries and look for the fight of their life. Why not provide it to them?\n\nIt would, of course, not do for an officer of the democratic government to be seen running around with paramilitary types. This is why Grigorenko does not advertise much his status as head of one of the biggest militias that backs the government. But his slow acquisition of soldiers of fortune and desperados has not been for nothing. Now the time comes to let some steam off Komi's fragile military apparatus.\n\nGrigorenko's men have begun a mass campaign of violence against the far left and far right. Much creative efforts have gone into his little project. Fascist leaders are found killed in the communist's favorite fashion. A stolen truck of the far right is filled with explosives and parked close to a communist meeting. Through all this, governmental soldiers associated with the extremes are found mysteriously dead. As the city descends into chaos, the extremists are likely to assume the useless centrist government is unable to protect them. Why not take action into their own hands, after all? From this initial wave of false flag attack, the good officer hopes to see the radicals throw one another in a mass grave of their own making. After all, it would not be proper for the government to be involved in such untidy violence."
 KOM.55.a: "Could it even work?"
 KOM.56.t: "A Bloodless Victory"
 KOM.56.d: "The inferno of political street fighting in Komi has begun to peter out. The far right and far left have run out of angry men with weapons. Dead, wounded or in despair about the loss of so many comrades to violence, members of various paramilitaries have begun pushing on their bosses for a temporary ceasefire. The thug's urge to turn swords into plowshares is probably helped by the complete stalemate. There appears to be no clear winner between the far right and far left, for all radical paramilitaries have been bloodied in the conflict. Temporary gains have inevitably turned into disastrous losses as the cycle of revenge went on. Militia men that had one day been struggling to carry their loot had been found dead in alleyways the next day.\n\nOne side, however, has made it through unscathed. The government's men, both in the army and off it, have been strangely uninvolved in the conflagration. As a result, few men of the centre have seen their military careers cut violently short. Where once it seemed inevitable to see extremists overwhelm the government, now the centrists hold a fair share of the balance of power."
 KOM.56.a: "A surprise, but a welcome one."
 KOM.57.t: "Silent Contemplation"
 KOM.57.d: "Stalina's office was tucked away in a distant corner of the building. This suited her, for few party members or employee ever wandered into her room by mistake. All the better to lose herself in thinking.\n\nLike her boss Voznesensky she liked to keep a clean office. In Komi, a small bubble of relative stability had been established from the Russian Anarchy. Her office's peace and quiet was to the rest of the governmental building a microcosm of what Komi should be to the rest of Russia. Could be.\n\nThe light flickered. The woman looked briefly to her small collection of candles. They were useful to keep around; a full day's worth of electricity was a rare treat in modern Russia.\n\nHer office was peaceful and orderly. The militias and paramilitaries made Komi a right mess. But how to get rid of them? Their leader kept the men on a short leash, lean and angry and looking for a scrap. It would probably not be too difficult to push the men over the edge and into open conflict. The small fries were never told why exactly they fought the men they fought; only when to strike. In this situation, perhaps a set of false flag attack might cause the rank and file to pressure their leaders for vengeance and retribution? Keeping angry, violent men on such a short leash was a double edged sword. The promise of violence led to expectations of violence.\n\nIn the shadows of Komi lurked radicals, idiots willing to invite the violence of the Russian Anarchy to Komi. The guardians of orders would need to invite violence in kind. No mercy for the enemies of stability."
 KOM.57.a: "Useful, someday."
 KOM.58.t: "Svetlana's Theories"
 KOM.58.d: "Voznesensky often wandered the halls of his party's edifice to stretch his legs. Every now and then, the President of the Republic saw his steps bring him to the door of one particular staircase. That way lay the path to Stalina's office. A strange location for the rising star of Komi's democratic politics. But the young woman had politely refused to move to a better office. Perhaps she treasured her peace and quiet?\n\nQuiet, Voznesensky had accepted he would have very little off when he became head of the young republic. Peace, on the other hand, he desperately craved. Each day brought in new problems. Schemes, intrigues, plots, manipulations. It drained him to keep track of the cards in play, and of the players holding them. This was in addition of his role as head of state. Keeping the economy chugging along, managing foreign policy, sifting through reports on the closest Russian warlords. He had very little time to make his own moves. Neither did Morozov. Busy with keeping the nation afloat, the democrats could do little against the extremist's schemes.\n\nVoznesensky found his hand on the door's handle. A flight of stairs. A corridor. A knock on the young woman's door. Another request. Another confident smile and nod.\n\nSvetlana Stalina's had arrived in Komi with nothing. She had fallen in love at first sight with her new home. The young woman loved Komi's stability, its order, its promise of progress. The radicals she hated with a passion. In them she saw echoes of the failed Soviet Union, of the evil fascist power that had plunged Russia in anarchy. She had joined the democrats in their efforts, and her intelligence, charisma and work ethics had charmed many. Others feared her and her own brand of radicalism. No amount of bloodshed would be too great for Komi. To party members tired of political violence she proposed a wave of terror to end all terrors.\n\nVoznesensky remained at the top of the stairs. He knew not if he wanted to go down."
 KOM.58.a: "We need her more than ever."
 KOM.58.b: "We can't afford to need her this much."
 KOM.59.t: "A Victory for Publicity"
 KOM.59.d: "Voznesensky shrugged off his fatigue. Stalina had been nothing but loyal, trustworthy asset, he though as he went down the stairs. To the spin doctors of the far right and far left, the democrats had struggled to find answer. Now Stalina led the charge at the head of a new generation of democratic politicians. Men and women unable to accept the death of a free and stable Komi without fighting.\n\nHer radicalism and influence were of course points of contention. But as long as they were well monitored, Voznesensky had in the young woman in indispensable ace in the hole. His support for her would of course need to be well calibrated, to avoid upsetting Stalina's detractor within the centrist coalition. But every decision in Komi required careful calibration anyway.\n\nA knock on his underling's door.\n\n\"Yes, you can enter.\"\n\nThe President did so.\n\n\"Ahh, Nikolai. I wanted to discuss with you.\"\n\nThe older politician smiled.\n\n\"Fancy dinner? We can catch up over some food.\"\n\n\"Only if you pay, Comrade President.\""
 KOM.59.a: "Let's hope there's no backlash."
 KOM.60.t: "A Victory for Internal Affairs"
 KOM.60.d: "The President continued his walk. Useful as she may be, the rising star of the party still had to be reined in. Schemes and plots that went outside the knowledge of the party higher ups was an especially big no-no. Voznesensky was quite certain that his underling's plan was targeted at the extremists, fair and square. But no one knew how far she would go. And Voznesensky had not stayed in the business for so long without learning never to give out blank cheques.\n\nLater, over dinner he wrote out a few memos. The party whip in particular he needed to meet. Stalina would receive an official warning. Heaven knew that it might not be enough to stop her. But it might at least serve as a cold shower on her ambition by signalling to her that the party was watching."
 KOM.60.a: "We should calm her down some."
 KOM.61.t: "Suslov Rampant"
 KOM.61.d: "As the conflict between the centrist government and the far right militia escalates, troubling news are spreading from several areas of Syktyvkar. As the violence has spread to several sectors held by the far right, areas of the city held by the far left have seen unusual activity. Many communist militias have moved into the open, aggressively pursuing protection money from new businesses. In effect, the left wing has expanded the size of its operations in formerly neutral or right wing sectors. Several political manifestations supporting the far left have applied increased pressure on the government, profiting from its inability to respond.\n\nSomewhere in the great game of Komi intrigue, Suslov must be smiling contentedly. A great deal of his activities are now going unchallenged, as his opponents are busy with one another."
 KOM.61.a: "Damnation!"
 KOM.62.t: "A Reconstruction Government?"
 KOM.62.d: "Secret meetings are part and parcel of political life in Komi. Yet it takes a special set of circumstances for the absolute highest level of security to be deployed. Deep in the chamber of the coalition's headquarters, with only a handpicked few bodyguards as witnesses, the leaders of the three democratic parties as well as Chairman Rodionov have agreed to a meeting with the democratic coalition's rising star.\n\nIt did not take long for the cat to come out of the bag. Svetlana Stalina directly brought up the subject; Komi's republic is in a bad shape. With extremist faction sharpening their knives, not long remains before the political system is judged obsolete and powerful forces try to unseat it. The best and only option is thus to strike first. By suspending democracy and marshaling all of the state's power, the center can hold off extremism and maintain a reconstruction government until the coast is clear. From this initial statement, the meeting went on..."
 KOM.62.a: "Perhaps we can do it... if needed."
 KOM.62.b: "This is too far."
 KOM.63.t: "Considerations"
 KOM.63.d: "The heads of the DSNP and SMR, as well as the Chairman of the National Assembly, have had plenty of experience with keeping a good poker face. Even so, Stalina's daring proposal has set in motion many sets of gears inside the three men's heads. Outwardly, however, the conversation has seen little more than questions about the details of Stalina's plan. A few token objections have been raised, to test the young woman's ideas. In the end, of a common accord the three party leaders agreed that the proposal had merit, and requested more time to consider the issue. Chairman Rodionov silently approved Voznesensky's proposal. Stalina agreed, satisfied with her progress. The daring proposal might have impressed some of the three men about her growing confidence. Perhaps a reshuffling of the political landscape might be on her horizon?"
 KOM.63.a: "Placated, for now."
 KOM.64.t: "A Meeting on the Side"
 KOM.64.d: "Some time after the meeting, the replies started to trickle into Stalina's mailbox. First came the social democrats; Voznesensky and Rodionov seemed the least enthused about the Reconstruction Government of the four. Then came the conservative leader's answer. After many circular reasonings, the man did not reveal much of his thoughts, and thus his opinion remained to be determined. Morozov's reply was very different. He communicated through intermediaries a request to Stalina for a private meeting.\n\nKeeping a secret from one's own political allies can be as difficult as hiding it from enemies. Yet in a remote spot of the Republic, the two politicians managed to meet. The leader of the liberals confided to Stalina his concern about the security situation. If the time came for such a drastic measure, Morozov would support the young politician's proposal."
 KOM.64.a: "Perhaps a new approach is feasible after all."
 KOM.65.t: "Zhdanovite Connections Revealed!"
 KOM.65.d: "Morozov often found his cabinet had devolved back into a mess of shuffled papers and documents. He was not fond of letting his secretaries clean it, and so once a week he began the task of reordering everything.\n\nIn between a report on the agricultural sector's output in the last few years and a memoranda about the state of highway funding was a strange unmarked letter. The leader of the liberals absentmindedly opened it. His heart skipped a beat; addressed to him by name, the letter described itself as \"coming from a friend\". Its content preposterously claimed to prove that President Voznesensky was a paid plant for Zhdanov.\n\nMorozov folded the letter back and slid it inside his breast pocket. His secretaries were used to see their boss tear off on some errand without informing them. The politician walked through the building, eventually reaching the quiet section where Stalina's office was.\n\nThe young politician was shocked to see Morozov break his own rules about meeting one another in public. Her surprise only grew when he passed to her wordlessly an envelope."
 KOM.65.a: "A traitor at the very top...?"
 KOM.66.t: "Beginning the Investigation"
 KOM.66.d: "The origin of the tip off remained a secret. Verifying the proof's truth was thus a difficult proposal. But the seeds of doubt remained in Stalina and Morozov's mind. Rumors of an improper friendship between Zhdanov and President Voznesensky cropped every now and then in Komi's wild world of political speculations. A few remembered how both men had been associates in the murky past of the WRRF days, despite their later falling out over political differences. The allegation of modern financial and political links was a very serious one that needed proper investigation.\n\nThe investigation would need to be secret, of course. How else would the ties between a communist leader of the opposition and the President of the Republic be ascertained? Both men were too used to Komi's political scene to be sloppy about any relationship. If news came out of this secret investigation, the President would deny everything. Stalina and Morozov's career would likely never recover. Prudence was the order of the day."
 KOM.66.a: "Ask him for answers. Now."
 KOM.66.b: "There's no need for confrontation."
 KOM.67.t: "The Confrontation"
 KOM.67.d: "Another meeting in the depth of the ruling coalition's headquarters. Stalina, Rodionov, and Morozov sat across President Voznesensky's seat. The social democrat politician chuckled something about not expecting to be thrown in front of the inquisition. Silently, Stalina pushed a manilla folder across the table. The President's attempt at levity having failed, he accepted without comment the set of papers and began leafing through them.\n\nA slight frown creased his traits. Worry? Confusion? None of the assembled democratic politicians could decide. All awaited for Voznesensky's response."
 KOM.67.a: "Oh?"
 KOM.68.t: "A Stable Partnership"
 KOM.68.d: "The President began by thanking the assembled democrats for trusting him with this delicate matter. The consequences to the coalition's trust might have been incalculable if doubt had been allowed to fester. The horror of seeing trusted colleagues scheming behind his back in a protracted witch hunt could have spelled the end of the President's work in the coalition.\n\nThe proof in question, he went on to explain, was clever for it used confusing places in his finances and assets to create the illusion of an unexplained amount of missing money where corruption could have been present. If the assembled men and women could give him a few hours, all would be explained.\n\nA break was indeed called, and food brought down. Stalina exchanged a glance with Morozov. The older man did not seem to know where all this was going either.\n\nIn the afternoon, a swathe of financial papers was presented. Morozov slowly ascertained their accuracy. As it turned, the numbers really meshed. Stalina was the first to get up from her seat and reach over to the President to shake his hand. \"Someone has tried to mislead us, and for that I apologize.\" The President shook her hand."
 KOM.68.a: "Unsafe, certainly. Necessary, possibly."
 KOM.69.t: "The Conspiracy"
 KOM.69.d: "No hunter would just stroll into the open and announce to its prey that the hunt is on. The secret investigation that began as a project by Morozov and Stalina has been carefully expanded to a trusted few liberal higher-ups. Sub-ministers within Stalina's growing, and accountants helping Morozov on economic matters, as well as a few intelligence men with ties to both politicians. The goal is to expand the nets of a conspiracy to figure out if Voznesensky has been compromised. By comparing classified information available to a range of different governmental role with whatever intelligence can be found on the communist factions' inner workings. Hopefully a slip up can be used to crack open the case."
 KOM.69.a: "You made us do this, Nikolai."
 KOM.70.t: "Approaching the Left"
 KOM.70.d: "Stalina's affinity with the social democratic party had seen her grow ever closer to many of its main players. Yet bringing up the accusation of improper final transactions by the party's leader and President of the Republic took a certain amount of prudence. The young politician requested a private meeting with Chairman Rodionov and a few trustworthy men of the DSNP to share her information.\n\nThe meeting's atmosphere was electric. The men suspected a rare event for Stalina to summon such an illustrious group. The absence of the President spoke volume about the gravity of the situation.\n\nWith everyone gathered, Stalina arranged her papers and began the meeting."
 KOM.70.a: "Let's hope they're not compromised."
 KOM.71.t: "Our Cover Blown!"
 KOM.71.d: "Voznesensky knows!\n\nThe President casually brought up rumors of an internal party crisis to Morozov. Voznesensky expressed dismay at the rumor, and said he had informed Morozov first to make sure this mystery cabal would not train its attention on the SMR's leader. Morozov was shaken by the implied threat; it was he could to thank the President and vow assistance in ending this shadowy cabal.\n\nWho could have betrayed them? Suspicion fell on Chairman Rodionov, but Stalina pointed out how the logistics of it didn't make sense.\n\nThe President didn't know the full extent of things, but he certainly knew that eyes were trained on him. The secret investigation was perhaps running out of time."
 KOM.71.a: "Is nobody loyal? Bury this!"
 KOM.71.b: "Give it one last try. Come clean."
 KOM.72.t: "Burying the Dirt"
 KOM.72.d: "The best way forward was to kill the investigation and bury everything. Members of the investigation were cut out of the secret conspiracy one by one, with a combination of threats and promises ensuring they would keep the secret. A few expendable informants were moved out of the city for the time being. Financial information that had served as Morozov's bedtime reading disappeared up the chimney.\n\nIt was all they could do... But as it turned out, it wasn't enough. The President diligently appraised his ally Morozov of every bit of progress hunting down the secret conspiracy. The walls were closing in on Morozov and Stalina."
 KOM.72.a: "May it never again arise."
 KOM.73.t: "Traitors to Democracy?"
 KOM.73.d: "Both partners in crimes stood in front of the higher ups of the democratic Coalition. Voznesensky spoke most often. He communicated his anger and dismay that the economist and the young politician had gone behind his back and instigated a witch hunt within the party. Had it spread, the damage to party unity might have been incalculable.\n\nBoth would be censured for their activity. As their intention had been to defend the coalition from possible infiltration, both culprits would be allowed to continue their political work. But from now on their work would be heavily monitored by members of the coalition.\n\nIn the panel of party activists censoring them, many former members of the conspiracy. What could they do? Stalina and Morozov had cut them off to limit the damage. Anyone advocating mercy risked incurring Voznesensky's ire on their head. The two culprits would have to suffer in isolation."
 KOM.73.a: "Can Komi be saved?"
 KOM.74.t: "A Successful Ploy"
 KOM.74.d: "'And so, the contradictions of capitalism shall lead to a World War, bringing in the new phase of world socialism.'\n\nSuslov's theory has proven itself accurate. With his plot to tear the liberals apart by stoking paranoia through his agents, the center was already splitting into irrelevant chunks. With every trial and accusation coming out of the formerly ironclad \"coalition for democracy\", he had another reason to celebrate.\n\nYes, Gumilyov, the esotericist madman, was still credible opposition, no matter how much he hated to say it. But Zhdanov had done his job well, and his attempt to seize power for himself by collaborating with the Voznesentsi had easily been twisted for the more... pure aims of the Revolution.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that Suslov was onto him. He wouldn't be punished... but perhaps a reminder was in order.\n\nYes, in the microcosm of the outside world that was Komi, the seeds of the Revolution had just been planted. All that remained to be done was finally break the opposition, and the red flag would fly once more."
 KOM.74.a: "Make it so."
 KOM.75.t: "The Confession"
 KOM.75.d: "Voznesensky and the party's whips were breathing down their necks. Time was running out. And so Morozov decided to play the last good card he held in his rapidly shrinking deck.\n\nVoznesensky did not make a good show of looking surprised at Morozov's request for a private meeting. When meeting the leader of SMR, the President of the Republic simply said \"Well?\" once both were alone. Morozov sighed. The explanation would be painful. But living through the humiliation was perhaps their only way out. And so, Morozov began to detail what he and Stalina had been up to."
 KOM.75.a: "Is it enough?"
 KOM.76.t: "The Leak Revealed"
 KOM.76.d: "The thought could initially be put aside by Morozov. In the panic to save himself and Stalina from Voznesensky, the leader of the liberals did not have much interest in figuring out how exactly Stalina and him had seen their scheme revealed. After pulling aside the President and coming clean with his secret investigation, the leader of the liberals found himself with a lot of spare time as he waited to hear about his fate.\n\nIn this new abundance of free time, Morozov's mind raced back to the cause of his trouble. How exactly had the President figured out the investigation team's activities, again? Voznesensky had made an offhand comment about one of his men's finding.\n\nSomething didn't add up, however. There was no way this particular informant could have known the details of the investigation that ended up in Voznesensky's hands. Perhaps then someone had forwarded the information to this man? Certainly not Zhdanov, for leaking his alliance with the President to the democratic coalition would lose him a great trump card. The far right might have known, but Morozov didn't feel they were behind this. No, this particular man of Voznesensky's inner circle might in fact be a Suslov acquaintance. The other master of the far left would certainly be in a position to weaken his rival and the government all at once.\n\nMorozov called to his secretary. The others in the democratic coalition needed to hear of this theory, no matter what."
 KOM.76.a: "How is this possible?"
 KOM.77.t: "The Eye of the Enemy"
 KOM.77.d: "Voznesensky was understandably a little bit grouchy at being dragged out to a new meeting by an avowed traitor. Still, his political instincts, his friendship with Morozov or something else convinced him to make the trip. Stalina was equally present, sitting by Morozov's side, gazing sternly ahead.\n\nVoznesensky sat in silence as he listened to Morozov's explanation. It did not take an expert on body language to see how troubled the President was by Morozov's theory.\n\nMorozov was the first to break the silence. \"So, a mysterious information drop reached you and Stalina, accusing the President of being a Zhdanovite plant. And then, a new source of information alerted the President that his own party was rebellious.\" He nodded gravely. \"If Suslov was behind the leak to the President, perhaps he was also behind the first leak to you and Stalina. If so, his infiltration of the party would need to be quite complete. Had I or President Voznesensky heard about information falling into your hands, the whole scheme would have broken down.\"\n\nTo these words, the three men and women fell silent. The implications were too catastrophic to discuss out loud."
 KOM.77.a: "Plots and maleficence, everywhere!"
 KOM.78.t: "Reigning in the Party"
 KOM.78.d: "Suslov walked a little easier these days. Even with his legion of spies in the government, it was never simple to determine why exactly the democratic parties did anything they did. Their leaders, although allies and mostly friendly to one another, jealousy hoarded their considerable personal influence. As a result it was a rare event for anyone to claim ownership of an unpopular policy such as ending the pressure on the far left.\n\nNo matter the cause, the end of the war on the far left let Suslov move more easily. Aggressive and ambitious underlings had pressured their boss to move violently against the government and far-right. Now that the bloodshed and propaganda war was over, a lot of Suslov's loyalists were free to crack some skulls and twist some arms to re-establish order. The fact he had calmly weathered the storm gave Suslov a lot of credibility, for now the left stood strong and the government appeared weak."
 KOM.78.a: "They will not fall to revisionism."
 KOM.79.t: "A Request for a Ceasefire"
 KOM.79.d: "The violent struggle between the government and the far left had left an opening for Gumilyov's scheme. Now the spectre of a far right take-over haunted Komi's young republic. Far-right paramilitaries had begun crawling out of their districts, moving into democratic and communist territories alike as the depleted manpower of both faction left them unable to oppose this take-over.\n\nIt was a risk for a face-to-face meeting to occur between Zhdanov and the President. But desperate hours called for desperate measures. Once both had reached the secluded meeting spot in the woods outside of Syktyvkar, Zhdanov requested his old friend an end to active hostilities between the government and the communists. Such a ceasefire would let both sides turn their attention to Gumilyov's imminent takeover attempt.\n\nThe President listened to Zhdanov's case without comment. Any question he asked might reveal information about the government's position. When the Communist leader finally fell silent, Voznesensky announced his intentions..."
 KOM.79.a: "He's gone too far."
 KOM.79.b: "Let's keep this between us..."
 KOM.80.t: "Refusing the Ceasefire"
 KOM.80.d: "The response was short, and polite. Voznesensky explained to Zhdanov that the government had no intention of ending the pressure on the communists.\n\nZhdanov excused himself and walked back to his bodyguards. The President watched his old friend being driven away, his expression indecipherable. Soon, he too had gone back to his bodyguards. His car soon drove off in the night."
 KOM.80.a: "There will be blood."
 KOM.81.t: "The Split Front"
 KOM.81.d: "Had there ever been a lull in the fighting? For the briefest of moments, the governmental and communist militias had stopped their clashes. Had it been fear at the rise of the far right militias? Or perhaps some inscrutable order from on top.\n\nThe lull, if it had ever existed, was shattered by a renewal of the violence. Both sides fought savagely. After all, only the extermination of the other would allow the victor to turn around to face the far right.\n\nSomewhere in Syktyvkar, Gumilyov smiled over a map of the city. Things were progressing smoothly."
 KOM.81.a: "We must only hope it was the right choice."
 KOM.82.t: "Zhdanov's Ceasefire"
 KOM.82.d: "One day the government's troops were attacking communist districts. The next, the democratic coalition's men were redeploying across the city. New positions were drafted to stop the progression of the far right's men.\n\nNo official announcement was made on the topic. It was left to the public to deduce the loose alliance that now united the communist and democrats. After all, the new combat lines of the reds and democrats would have made no sense otherwise. Vast sections of the democratic and communist districts were left lightly guarded by their owners if their frontiers happened to touch the other side's areas. This level of cooperation, as well as the heightened level of militarization of the front line with the far right demonstrated that at least some coordination had been agreed upon.\n\nGreatest loser in all this were the far right paramilitaries, suddenly pushed back from their over-extended positions. The government's temporary united front with the communist appeared to be working as intended."
 KOM.82.a: "Allies across the lines."
 KOM.83.t: "A Traitor?"
 KOM.83.d: "The two politicians were united by their distrust of the ceasefire with the reds. Stalina loathed the extremist factions for endangering Komi, while the more moderate Morozov was worried less by the ceasefire than its implication. How the hell had the President managed to reach a deal with the reds? To the liberal leader's eyes, this secret deal meant the President must have held secret ties to the far left.\n\nThe 'rightist' members of the democratic coalition began planning a joint action against Voznesensky. The President was proving himself to be a liability to the democratic cause, and some sense needed to be talked into him... Or imposed at gunpoint, if necessary."
 KOM.83.a: "Peace must come first."
 KOM.83.b: "We are done with talk."
 KOM.84.t: "The Militarists' Confrontation"
 KOM.84.d: "Voznesensky looked at them benevolently, his eyes rising above a pile of paperwork. \"I was told Rodionov would be present, yes?\"\n\nMorozov shrugged. \"He has a cold today. Voznesensky, we came here today about the ceasefire with the left. This shit can't go on.\" The President cocked an eyebrow. \"The left is rising in power every day. I can't take an evening walk without bumping into Suslov informants. We've had their paramilitary on the ropes with the campaign against them, and now you let them escape? If we don't destroy them now they'll relieve us of our jobs.\"\n\nThe President closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, his reply was confident..."
 KOM.84.a: "\"There will be no compromise!\""
 KOM.84.b: "\"You see, this was the plan all along...\""
 KOM.85.t: "No Compromise!"
 KOM.85.d: "\"I understand your concerns. But I'm not budging on this. During our campaign on the communist we began hemorrhaging territory to the far right. We need to crush the fascists if this republic is to last the year. If you have other concerns, feel free to bring them up to me now. Otherwise, this lovely pile of paper requires presidential signatures.\"\n\nMorozov and Stalina were taken aback. Voznesensky waited expectantly for another round of argument. However, his colleagues stiffly offered him goodbye and left. The President sighed and returned to the task at hand."
 KOM.85.a: "What is he hiding?"
 KOM.86.t: "Voznesensky Folds"
 KOM.86.d: "\"I understand your concerns. But this has just been a temporary plan. Our men are waiting for the communist to surge out against the fascist before we turn on them. From the start I didn't trust the communist to uphold any bargain made. Thus, this method of finishing them off while also repulsing the far right's attack.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Morozov said. Stalina's expression remained difficult to interpret. Was she buying his excuses? \"We'll let you to it, Voznesensky. Sorry for bothering you. I might drop by later when the time comes to send the orders to turn on the reds, yes?\"\n\n\"It would be my pleasure. We'll send the encrypted orders over the radio to our commanders.\" Said the President, his eyes already back to his tax forms. Morozov and Stalina left without any further word."
 KOM.86.a: "We can all get along, no?"
 KOM.87.t: "The Leak"
 KOM.87.d: "Commander names, streets, positions, hours. The radio broadcast over public frequencies didn't arouse much more than curiosity from the average civilian. But to anyone invested in Komi's great game, the communication was crystal clear. The message was a set of deployment order to governmental militias, arraying them to the rear of almost every communist militia. The only reason for such a deployment was not hard to divine.\n\nThe message was confirmed to be the real deal when policemen aligned with the democratic coalition jammed every radio frequency they could find. The government's panic demonstrated their guilt. The plan had been the annihilation of every communist brigade that could be trapped on the front line against the far right. Now everybody knew of the democrats' duplicity."
 KOM.87.a: "How could this be?!"
 KOM.88.t: "The Infiltrators"
 KOM.88.d: "The scale of the leak was titanic. To betray the deployment order of every democratic paramilitary, one would need men inside every brigade. This was the only way to break every secret cipher in a single twenty-four hour period.\n\nNot only had Suslov infiltrated the highest level of the democratic parties, the democratic paramilitaries were deeply compromised as well. The government had no secret left to fight back against the far left's puppet master."
 KOM.88.a: "A nest of traitors and spies!"
 KOM.89.t: "All Quiet from Zhdanov"
 KOM.89.d: "Voznesensky removed the brick from the wall and rummaged inside the hole. Nothing but his original message attempt.\n\nSince the disastrous radio leak, it had been impossible to reach Zhdanov. None of the usual dead drop locations had seen any activity. Voznesensky was tempted to use the emergency channel they had reserved for immediate communication. But Zhdanov's continued silence communicated a message in itself. The President burning his last contact method to hear his old friend's silent fury would not be productive.\n\nVoznesensky picked up the brick. Instead of closing up the dead drop, the politician threw the brick as far as he could. The projectile hit a distant lamppost with a loud \"thunk\". \"When has everything gone so goddamn wrong?\" Voznesensky thought bitterly."

The new word from central command was, all available forces were to stop their advances on the reds and whip around to smash the fascist paramilitaries.\n\nBoris began by verifying all of the messenger's credentials. Everything checked out, bizarrely. The orders themselves were written with the usual codes. A phone call to central headquarters confirmed this big switch in priorities. \"We were on the brink of ending the communists. \" the commander informed the messenger. Not as a reproach, but rather as a statement of facts. The messenger, a young man with a scraggly beard, nodded. Boris could see that his interlocutor, too, was confused by the switch of priorities. But orders were orders. 'twas not for Boris and his ilk to question them. The commander hoped his men would understand, lest things become mutinous."

Most enraged of all were his allies in the democratic coalition: the remaining social democrats, suddenly realizing the cause of their party's downfall; Shafarevich's conservatives, our erstwhile allies, unnerved by the idea of communists worming their way into the government; and most of all Morozov's liberals, livid at the betrayal. The chief of the SMR has gone on the warpath upon hearing of the leaks, promising a vote of no-confidence to oust the traitor President.

In disgrace, Voznesensky saw his presidency revoked and was forced to cede power to Morozov, his former second in command. Komi's constitution is quite clear about the chain of succession for executive power. The downfall of Voznesensky means the ascension of Morozov.\n\nIf book makers weren't sure about betting on the downfall of the former President, money is already being put on the lifespan of the new presidency. For all his energetic speech urging the removal of Voznesensky, Morozov has not given any response to those who worry about the fragility of the democratic coalition. Shorn of the social democrat's left wing, and with his contempt of the communists on display, the new President must quickly find a way of stabilizing his political backing, lest the same fate befalls him.\n\nhis political reputation as a neutral leader of order and stability destroyed, and his political party collapsing, Voznesensky's political career is finished.

Yes, Voznesensky has proven to be an enemy of the common worker... But Morozov has done nothing but encourage the democratic coalition to ramp up the war against the left. The communist leaders thus left individual members of parliament free to vote. As such a surprising grouping of deputies have let Voznesensky cling to power.\n\nThe leader of the SMR has answered with a speech about the ignominy of staying in power through fascist and communist votes. Morozov has urged vigilance to all members of the democratic coalition, lest radical agenda slip through Voznesensky's presidential orders. In a speech of his own, a visibly shaken Voznesensky has thanked the Republic for its continued confidence in him. The President went on to urge cooperation in these difficult time.

What choice did the President have but collaboration with Zhdanov? Without the social democrat's majority in the chamber, Voznesensky had entered a very precarious position. Any hint to the rest of the democratic coalition that he was compromised by communist deals would see them throw him out into the streets.\n\nThe President pushed the food away.

Nothing was scheduled for the next few hours, so it was just him and the work he had to do. But as much as he tried to focus on it, one topic kept coming up in his mind: Voznesensky and his... racist tendencies. On the one hand, cooperating with the social democrats would be useful in general: he could appease the President, continuing to usurp power from his faction while keeping good terms. On the other hand, his knowledge of the President's beliefs was worrying. The public relations of the Center Coalition, and his own party by extension, could hang in the balance if a scandal appeared. Would he risk such a thing for power?"

As for the program itself, it was pulled off almost perfectly, going without a hitch. Many Komi welcomed the opportunity to receive help by the government and seem supportive of the new policy.\n\nIn general, some seem convinced by this, but despite this small boost in the popularity of the Social Democrats and the Coalition, it would be a lie to say we are fully satisfied with the results. The numbers we were hoping for were not achieved, and small hurdles in our way reduced the effectiveness, with many natives either not convinced due to the President's past, or simply indifferent to the new policy. It seems that this was not the help we are looking for to gain support in our struggle against the left and right."

Many Komi took the opportunity to help in the festival, by participating in the exhibitions of anything from traditional clothes, to customs and music. The neighborhood has been flooded with the colorful patterns of the natives, and some artists have even helped create a fusion of these traditional designs with modern ideas for artistic masterpieces. The Museum of Komi Culture also cooperated, and has welcomed many visitors this week.\n\nIn general, the Festival seems to have been a massive success for the organizers. Many Russian citizens of Syktyvkar were actually ignorant of the Komi lifestyle and culture, and found this as a fascinating opportunity to educate themselves on it. Now, all of the city is more informed on what this civilization truly is."

The book details the history of modern Komi, from the creation of the autonomous territories by the Soviet Union, to its role as part of the WRRF, until its modern state. The author has in fact lived through almost this entire era, and as such had a first-hand experience that helped him write the book.\n\nCritics have acclaimed the book, which combines elements of historical literature with Smirnov's own experiences throughout his life in a way appealing to all readers. \"The History of Our Republic\" has skyrocketed in popularity days within its release among both ethnic Russians and natives. The Komi themselves also appear to be satisfied with the image presented, and point to the modern problems mentioned as well as the need for equality and respect from their co-patriots.\n\nThe question is, aside from the clear cultural impact and legacy such a popular book will leave in the Republic, if there will possibly be any political implications. Smirnov himself has clearly stated he is not affiliated with any of the myriads of political organizations operating in the nation, and is independent. Of course, not all believe that, but for the most part, \"A History of Our Republic\" appears to be nothing more than an insight into the history of the natives that play such an important role in this nation."

Within her inaugural speech, Stalina laid out her plans for Komi:\n\n\"Dear citizens of the Republic, dear friends, radicalism is a dangerous thing. In the war, I felt the bite of radicalism for the first time. It has cost me my father, my mother, my husband, and my brother. We must oppose radicalism at all costs, before it costs us that which is most precious: our democracy. We must stand together under the principles of sovereignty, democracy, and patriotism! We must construct a strong, united Republic; we must construct a strong, united Russia! Our Republic must be assertive, our brave soldiers must be strong, and our people must be fed! We shall not fall to radicalism, which weakens our democracy and divides our people! Radicalism divided our Motherland, and continues to divide our Motherland! We must ensure the safety of our democracy, so that we may ensure the safety of all of Russia! I vow to you that we shall have stability, and that we shall have unity! Our Republic shall stand strong and united! All of Russia shall stand strong and united!\"\n\nStalina's speech was certainly passionate and idealistic. Stalina's critics nevertheless still call her an authoritarian, and voice many concerns over her calls to expand the military and police. Nevertheless, only time will tell if President Stalina was the right choice for Komi."

Either way, Morozov now stood before the National Assembly, not as a Deputy, but as President of the Republic. In his inaugural speech, Morozov laid out his plans for Komi:\n\n\"Deputies of the Republic, we can surely all agree that Komi has seen incredible progress in recent years. We have made great progress in recovering from the bombings, lowering the death toll, and attracting people to live in our great Republic. I do not wish to harm any of those advances. However, I believe a new course of action is the right choice for Komi's future. We must not be satisfied with the current status quo, which brings such inequality and chaos to our Republic. We must also not adhere blindly to an economic system that creates such inequality within our people and places such heavy restrictions upon the common man. If we are to develop our Republic, we must introduce: Stable democracy, sweeping market reforms, and a greater openness to the outside world. Komi must see greater liberalization in its economy in order to bring about a truly equal society. I call upon the National Assembly to stand for democracy and reform, so that our Republic may be the shining beacon to all of Russia's peoples.\"\n\nMorozov's speech fit such a prominent and experienced politician. However, Morozov's critics asked how exactly his reforms would bring equality to the common man, and if Morozov's speech was too optimistic and betrayed his tendency to focus too much upon urbanites and intellectualism.

As she enters the room the familiar clang of the ringing phone begins, but upon answering Bukharina hears nothing but dead air. After ten uncomfortable seconds the connection is cut. Confused and worried, she makes a note to dial up Medvedev and the rest to check if harassment against politicians is ongoing. Perhaps a reactionary Passionariyy cell? In any event, she has more pressing matters to deal with than a few agitators. She opens the envelope sealed with Party wax-seal, leafing through the brief dossier. Then there is a cold, cold silence in Syktyvkar, and in her house, and in the heart where dreams of a Red Star once arose. \"It is with regret that I declare you suspended, Svetlana Bukharina. I wish it could have been any other way- but for the Party to be secure, it must cast you out of our ranks.\""

As he cosigns the Party documents he asks if the boy's heard anything from Central - that snake Suslov has been suspiciously quiet these couple of weeks, and snakes rarely stay quiet unless they're planning on an expedient dinner. The boy only casts him a confused stare in reply. He sighs and returns the form, slipping the boy a little sugar-sweet from a well-meaning guest.

 KOM.389.d: "Ivan Serov glares at Igor Shafarevich, or perhaps he's smiling. On the face of a man like Serov, it can be hard to tell between the two. Then they reach out to each other and shake hands. The Convergence is over, and the Impossible Duo has, against all odds, beaten back their opposition amongst the Rightists of Komi.\n\nThe effect is instantaneous: Gumilyov, upon hearing of his defeat, has the cheer crumble off his face, along with his confidence. His hands trembling, he points to the Coalition and snaps, \"It was - it was the Romano-Germanics that did this! They have usurped the will of the People, putting impostors in my - our place!\" As his own followers stare at this sudden lurch into idiocy, the spell is broken. Gumilyov finds himself the centre of a gradually widening circle, and as he is dragged out of the hall for disorderly conduct no one follows him, or bats an eye.\n\nTaboritsky, conversely, chuckles. He bows his head and he begins to laugh, in uproarious bursts that heave the breath from him, and when he is finished he wipes the tears from his eyes. His eyes shining, he points towards the ceiling in rapturous wonder and proclaims only this:\n\n\"I have been wrong. All this time. Perhaps the King I seek shall not be found through me - perhaps I am not a worthy vessel. But as for YOU!\" He points to the increasingly confused duo. \"Promise me you will follow the will of the Skein. Promise me!\" He falls silent, and his own entourage applaud politely, while the rest of the Passionariyy stare in mute horror.\n\nSerov glances at Shafarevich, and there is no warmth shared in the glance, only the cold taste of victory and the colder calculus running through the minds of both. For while two can win -"

 KOM.390.d: "Igor Shafarevich looked over to his ally-turned-rival-turned-ally. The outcome was out of their hands now, all the votes had been collected, and all they had left to do was wait. If Lev Gumilyov had any doubts about the outcome, he was doing a good job of hiding it. Igor was less assured. The rise of Taboritsky and Serov to become real contenders for the Convergence had left him thoroughly rattled, and he felt more anxious than he'd ever expected to. He drew some calm from his ally, however, and kept his composure. A few minutes later, it was finally time to announce the results of the vote.\n\n\"The winners of the vote and leaders of the Passionariyy are Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich.\" The Assembly erupted into cheers, their supporters expressing the relief also washing over him. As Igor got out of his seat, he was pulled into a big hug by Gumilyov, the force of which betrayed that his ally, too, had carried doubts of their success. It didn't matter anymore. Their gambit had worked. They had won. They had secured the future of their movement, and they had shut out the NKVD thug and the delusional tsarist. As he knew deep down that they would. This was their movement after all.\n\nThe defeated candidates wasted little time in rallying their supporters and leaving the assembly. They would have to be dealt with, of course. While no doubt weakened by their defeat here, both men had the potential to make a real nuisance of themselves. But that was a problem for another day. Today they would celebrate."

Their gambit proved successful, and the two now share leadership of the organization. With their common foes overcome, few expected the alliance to last very long, an expectation which has now proven accurate.\n\nOnly hours after the end of the Convergence, the two men have already renounced one another. Their respective supporters are already on the move, and life is once again brought to a terrified stop as a fierce power struggle plays out on its streets. While it's hard to predict which of the two men will emerge victorious, the consequences of victory are easy to foresee. Enigmatic tsarist or NKVD-turned-nationalist, whoever wins this most recent contest will be the master of Komi, whoever loses will be dead in a ditch. For now, the people lock their doors as the battle rages in the streets."

 KOM.392.d: "The stability of the coalition between Monarchists and Ordosocialists was always in question. Many assumed it would break inevitably - and that to bet on Ivan Serov would be the obvious choice. With his military connections, it seemed obvious that the final struggle between the two would be somewhat slanted towards him, and the confrontation was indeed brief.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, several reported awakening to the sound of gunshots, and multiple military and paramilitary forces \"occupying\" several locations ranging from homes to pivotal roads, with several of Taboritsky's deputies being awoken and dragged out at gunpoint. As for Taboritsky himself, rumors abound to his exact location, though most agree that he is no longer in Komi.\n\nSerov is now the undisputed master of the Republic - though with his former allies gone, one can question how much his power base has been afflicted by their removal. Solidifying his grip over Komi is doubtless the first thing on his agenda, and while his supporters cheer... others fear for their lives."

 KOM.393.d: "Few were surprised when the alliance between Monarchists and Ordosocialists only took days to break down. Fewer are surprised that the resulting power struggle has proven to be brutal.\n\nWhile vicious, at least it's also proving to be brief, as a decisive blow seems to have been struck in the small hours this morning when paramilitaries loyal to Taboritsky were observed taking action in several locations across the Republic. Masked men were seen breaking into the residences of Serov's closest supporters and taking them away to an unknown location. The action has proven a decisive one, as most of Serov's inner circle seems to have been seized successfully, the rest having gone into hiding and Serov himself also missing. There are multiple rumours surrounding his whereabouts spreading, but a growing number of reports agree he's fled Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Taboritsky is now the master of the state. With his erstwhile allies gone, however, their fates unknown except to their captors, his base of support appears precariously diminished. Whether he can keep the power he's secured remains to be seen."

Small private meetings. All with similar guests, and all with similar phrases. \"I will protect the proletariat.\" \"I will restore socialism.\" \"I will keep the traditions of the past alive.\" Despite the similar gatherings and similar guests however, the responses are different. To some of his pleas he gains nods of acquiescence, while others reply with questions, or cold defiance.\n\nAnd yet, he continues. Why? Perhaps he's genuine. Perhaps he never left the party at all, and perhaps Suslov got him wrong. Perhaps he's looking for men he can get brief support from, and then depose of them when he no longer needs them. Or - perhaps he's simply opportunistic, willing to bend whatever way will get him power. No one knows but Serov.\n\nWhat is known to all however, is that this is a risky gamble."

What was there to be done about it, though? He remembered how they'd treated Lenin and Bukharin, and if he was going to restore Soviet order to Russia, they'd treat him like that as well.\n\nBut they liked Bukharin! The golden child, they called him, with his boyish face, his affable smile, and his charming manner. Sure, people feared Bukharin's name, but when they faced the man himself they were laughing and joking with the General Secretary. He had his disagreements with his erstwhile comrade and boss, but Nikolai had been good at one thing; making people like him. It was how he'd come to power. He'd have to calm those around him.\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] gestured to one of the Party militia officers he'd brought with him. \"Hand me that cap, comrade,\" and he then put it on his head. \"Comrade photographer!

Soon there would be something far superior to give the workers of the world protection. Still, he'd deal with them for now.\n\n\"Comrade President,\" the chairman began, \"Thank you very much for meeting with us.

Come to think of it, he'd heard that the streets there needed an improvement. He took out the paper and pencil, thinking of a new way to organize the flow of urban traffic.

 KOM_SMR_election_the_morozov_presidency_desc: "With great relief, we have achieved victory! Our coalition has been triumphant in the turbulent recent elections and all under the Union of Young Reformers. The success in the election represents both the continued support and strength of democracy in our glorious republic, as well as a slight rightward shift as Voznesensky steps down.\n\nThe government we represent is one of progress for Russia. Liberal to its core, Komi will be a truly western country, perhaps someday possessing ties with countries like the United States. Modernization, equal opportunity, and stability are all goals of our party and will steer the direction we take Komi. Someday we may even reach socialism through these targets, although that is for the far future, past the concern of Morozov himself."
 KOM_SMR_election_democratic_redemption_desc: "As much as we praise the democratic system our dear Komi was built on, it is far from perfect. Under it, extremists circle the edges of our system, waiting for the perfect moment to strike and tear apart the state. In its place, they wish to replace it with one built on their disgusting ideologies, destroying the democratic institutions that originally brought them to power. While these flaws are tragic, they are not beyond fixing.\n\nA redemption of the system will be pursued, patching its holes and replacing them with something truly functional. No longer will parties like the KPK and RNP have the same kind of hold on politics that they do know, as the loopholes and tactics that gave them their power are destroyed in the name of justice and stability."
 KOM_SMR_election_the_stalina_commission_desc: "While we are not always proud to admit it, our current government is built on a coalition with two other parties, the DSNP and PSD. We might not agree on everything, but we are all united in the principles of democracy, and a shared disliking of extremists. The PSD is especially hostile to the fringe groups, possessing a passionate hatred for anything that could pose a threat to the republic.\n\nAs part of our efforts to stomp down on the extremist threat, we will appoint deputy Svetlana Stalina of the PSD to the position of Minister of Justice in the National Assembly. Our government will fully back her in eradicating the paramilitary units controlled by the other parties. With someone as passionate as her, we can be sure to expect nothing less than success."
 KOM_SMR_election_sever_the_crime_rings_desc: "One of the ways the radicals in Komi have gained so much power is through a system of crime and corruption. This rot infects every aspect of society. They run protection rackets, threatening good people in exchange for political support, while simultaneously rigging votes. At the same time, illegal funding fills their pockets, securing them platforms and influence they never deserved.\n\nCracking down on these unwanted hooligans is now our government's top priority. Traitorous police officers will be purged, and these violent crime outfits broke with an iron fist. Our people must be protected from the outlets of corruption. Without their sources of power, the extremists will begin to lose their power, securing our democracy from them forevermore."
 KOM_SMR_election_an_offensive_of_our_own_desc: "The government of Komi has always had an unfortunate and mostly passive position with its radical elements. Intervention only occurred if these fanatics attacked civil targets. At most extremist groups would be infiltrated and played off each other, but otherwise left to fester and mutate into the danger they are now.\n\nOur government will not be like the others of old. A more direct response will be undertaken to break the extremists once and for all. Raids and arrests will be undertaken by our government, alongside our paramilitaries to finally exterminate the radical violence once and for all. No longer will inaction be done in the name of stability, but action done to secure stability and safety."
 KOM_SMR_election_uncover_their_liabilities_desc: "Despite their wickedness, the radicals of Komi have their foothold in the National Assembly. Even if we straightened out the system, these corrupt politicians would still provide the extremists with a source of power to rebuild and spread their disgusting ideology. Limiting their government influence then becomes invaluable in defeating them.\n\nSmear campaigns to expose how truly disgusting these individuals are will help limit their public support. Likewise, exposing the connections in the KPK and RNP deputies to illegal activity would make impeaching them directly possible and justifiable. Similarly, blackmailing and harassment to get the more relatively moderate members in line would be effective."
 KOM_SMR_election_we_shall_ask_no_longer_desc: "Past governments have been far too nice in how they approach radicals. Their prior strategy has been to kindly ask anti-democratic forces to act a little more civilly and act in manners that go against what they seek to achieve, like some frail old babushka. This old strategy has been catastrophic, leaving us with a mess most republics would find fantastical.\n\nUnfortunately for these extremists, we are not like our predecessors. The SMR will not tolerate their actions anymore. We will ask no more and instead threaten them into a corner, lest they face unholy retribution by our righteous will if they get out of line. They will be crushed once and for all, and our democracy will be finally secured."
 KOM_SMR_election_the_road_forwards_desc: "Development has been a key aspect of the SMR's platform for as long as it has existed. To us, the movement towards the state's growth is vital to the future of the Republic and its values which we recognize as the most important. Whether it is economic or social, this forward evolution of society is critical.\n\nKeeping an eye directly on this issue is of immediate importance now that we are in power. Our optimism knows no bounds but looking at how some of this progress can be made immediately is of particular pragmatic value."
 KOM_SMR_election_encourage_a_qualified_citizenry_desc: "Economic development is the most important policy of any government, and ours is no exception. For too long has ignorance of crucial sectors been allowed to proliferate and our economy falters as a result.\n\nMorozov is done tolerating this industrial neglect. Funding a more innovative industry will be a key part of our economic budget for the year. Likewise, our citizenry will finally have the tools necessary to obtain and operate more complex industrial jobs, as we start up a series of job training programs. Soon Komi will be a truly economically prosperous society, sure to provide the state and its citizens with plenty of money and production capacity for what is ahead."
 KOM_SMR_election_ignorance_nevermore_desc: "While the Republic of Komi has always had an education system, its quality has been subpar for most children and citizens. A good portion of our population is still illiterate and gullible to deception. Meanwhile, the information children are taught is mixed with lies and even political propaganda more than we are comfortable with.\n\nFor our Republic to advance on a societal level then, fixing these faults is crucial. Expanding our outreach to those outside of the cities, and opening night classes for our less fortunate that are older will help tremendously. Similarly, altering the curriculum to focus on critical thinking will help create a citizenry that is both adaptable and likely to succeed later in life."
 KOM_SMR_election_streamline_public_assistance_desc: "Administrative efficiency is a desirable aspect of any state, and our glorious Republic is no exception. Unfortunately for us, we lack this highly prized characteristic in some parts of the government. One of the most atrocious examples of this is our social welfare system. In the past, the solution has been to throw more money at people, without considering the actual material situation people are in.\n\nNo longer though, as we move to streamline the process. The bureaucratic efficiency will be improved so that we waste fewer government resources on the system as we focus efforts on who needs the help."
 KOM_SMR_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "As time passes, it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore the danger in the air. Raiding becomes increasingly frequent and our neighbors ever so more organized. It will not be much longer before the full-out Smuta erupts and states try to reunify our region of Russia.\n\nTo make sure we do not fall behind we will pass the National Reclamation Act through the National Assembly. Through it, we will issue various funding and legal allowances to be diverted to the military and diplomatic corps in the effort to unify Russia. Given the consensus on the issue, we can expect support from the other parties, something that will be a relief for Morozov with the guaranteed difficulties ahead."
 KOM_SMR_election_a_managerial_outline_desc: "A key aspect of any war is logistics and the ability for us to keep our troops supplied and fed. With Smuta on the horizon, this is more important now than ever. The fundamental ideology of the SMR has been that a strong managerial state guiding a privately-owned economy is one that works best.\n\nThis same philosophy will guide our wartime production as we prepare. State control of industry will be expanded, with government mandates and production boards ensuring everything we need for war is produced. Some of the Republic's elites may grumble and our efficiency less than optimal, but we can take no chances when it comes to war."
 KOM_SMR_election_inspiration_for_development_desc: "The clouds of war draw ever nearer and with it the concerns of running said war. One of the most crucial ingredients of military success is a sound logistical situation. Our industry needs to be thought of to ensure the security of our material needs. While a steady control by the state would be ideal given the SMR's platform, efficiency needs to be prioritized over want.\n\nAs such, the government will cut deals and make compromises with the current elite industrial magnates to reach this efficiency. In exchange for cooperation and supplies, the state will provide generous funding to these private industries. This will have a cost on the state, but it is a fair deal."
 KOM_SMR_election_into_modernity_desc: "After much work, we have finally managed to extinguish the flames left over from the election. The threat of extremists has been eradicated, and the preparations for war made. For the first time in forever, a calm permeates our Republic. However, the fire is about to be replaced with a conflagration as a new Smuta engulfs the entirety of western Russia.\n\nIt would be better for the SMR to start this one than to get caught up in it, and as such, it is time for us to begin to re-unify Russia ourselves. Finally, the hopes of the SMR will see meaningful success. The ideas we fight for freedom, modernity, and democracy will soon be spread across the entire region by our hands."

 KOM_DSNP_election_the_voznesensky_presidency_desc: "Despite numerous scandals, waning approval ratings, and the near-collapse of our very republic, President Nikolai Voznesensky of the DSNP has emerged as the clear winner in the recent election, securing yet another term with which to advance his mandate. The status quo has survived, and with it comes many questions. Could this be a sign that the dark clouds that hang over our democracy are finally passing, or could it be a grim omen of things to come?\n\nWhichever it may be, the President will need to maneuver carefully to ensure that the chaos of the past year does not come back to haunt our democracy again..."
 KOM_DSNP_election_democratic_preservation_desc: "Our young democracy has withstood perhaps its greatest test of all. The creeping influence of extremism had worked its way into the bloodstream of Syktyvkar, igniting all manner of political violence across the streets. Yet, in spite of it all, the people remained steadfast, and their votes allowed democratic institutions to live on, if only for a bit longer.\n\nPresident Voznesensky and the DSNP have now made it their goal to enshrine the preservation of democracy at any cost, and to correct the mistakes of the past. Extremism only thrives when the people lose confidence in their leaders, and become apathetic about their votes. For the sake of lasting stability, a persistent trust in democratic ideals must be fostered; one that does not come through a cycle of violent repression."
 KOM_DSNP_election_formalize_the_unwritten_rules_desc: "In years past, the political organizations of Komi operated under a set of \"unwritten rules\", that, essentially, served as the terms and conditions of the great game that is our political system. Under these unspoken laws, parties were free to do whatever actions they deemed necessary, legal or not, as long as they remained within their circles and did not bring direct harm to their political rivals.\n\nThough some may criticize this system as deeply corrupt and turning a blind eye to extremism, it is the last vestige of civility our democracy truly has. In fact, the chaos of the past came only when extremist groups increasingly came to ignore the rules of the game, not because of the rules themselves! Therefore, the President has seen fit to codify these rules into law, greatly expanding the power of parties to govern their own affairs and loosening restrictions on political expression. Hopefully, with the so-called \"unwritten rules\" no longer a nebulous concept, our rivals can see this as a gesture of goodwill and finally learn to respect our institutions.\n\nHopefully..."
 KOM_DSNP_election_equalize_the_system_desc: "Although the Komi Republic prides itself on being one of the last vestiges of true democracy in all of Russia, its system is nothing if not flawed. In fact, you could say it is laughably corrupt beyond any measure of reason. The formerly unwritten rules are now the law of the land, and to ensure this legislation does not immediately blow up in our faces, some new boundaries will need to be set.\n\nFrom now on, each and every party, no matter their beliefs, will operate on a level playing field. Through the redrawing of districts and the measured defanging of paramilitary forces, none will be afforded more influence and power than the other. With the proper checks and balances in place, it is our belief that a more healthy, but no less diverse political environment can come into fruition."
 KOM_DSNP_election_the_limits_of_tolerance_desc: "Although the Komi Republic prides itself on having a wonderfully diverse political environment, the chaos of the last election has taught us many hard lessons about what happens when extremists are given the same platforms as honest, democratic organizations. Under the so-called \"unwritten rules\", bad-faith actors were afforded far more influence than they reasonably should have, and it almost resulted in the collapse of democracy itself. If we have learned anything at all, this cannot be allowed to happen again.\n\nIt is time for a harsh reminder to all that our republic will not tolerate those who seek to dismantle its hard-fought freedom by cynically abusing its institutions. Political parties must be made to wholly uphold democratic values, or they can forget about being allowed to participate in the system."
 KOM_DSNP_election_divestments_and_smokescreens_desc: "Needless to say, money and politics go together like oil and water. While it's only natural that one has to grease the wheels from time to time, financial interests are where almost all the corruption that plagues the Republic is born from. Some political organizations have tied themselves to local businesses through investments, trading political favors for kickbacks from their benefactors, and compromising the integrity of their elected officials. It is time to crack down on this nonsense.\n\nWith all parties forced to divest from private businesses in the Republic, we can hopefully begin to regain stronger financial control over the political sphere, and cut down on blatant conflicts of interest within the assembly. After all, leaders in an ideal democracy are supposed to represent their people, not their business partners!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_strengthen_the_legal_system_desc: "In the ideal democratic society, laws are created to serve the interests of law and order first and foremost. The Komi Republic, however, has allowed the integrity of its legal code to atrophy and become beholden to the whims of partisan politics. A new judiciary must be rebuilt from scratch, freed from the mistakes of yesteryear and cleaned from the stain of political bias. Only then can we make any boasts of a free and fair system of justice, where the line between innocent and guilty remains a distinct and tangible thing."
 KOM_DSNP_election_restore_the_blindfold_desc: "The legal system has long been infiltrated by the creeping influence of unimpeded political warfare, and even the judges have not escaped this corruption. Even now, there are those who sit on the bench with only the interests of their political sponsors at heart, rather than the pursuit of objective justice. These stooges must be excised from the court, and replaced with individuals who can be trusted to maintain a semblance of neutrality to the political sphere. Justice, after all, is said to be blind, and so it falls to us to ensure that her eyes remain obscured to the influence of partisan squabbles."
 KOM_DSNP_election_a_peace_with_honour_desc: "It seems that the worst has passed. After years of impassioned shouting matches in the assembly juxtaposed against brutal battles in the streets, the political sphere in the republic at last is entering a period of relative calm and civility. The DSNP has been seen by its detractors as a party too corrupt to achieve meaningful change, but now we have certainly proved them wrong. While lingering issues persist, we can, for now, return to a more civilized form of political maneuvering to solve our many problems: one that does not involve violent reprisals or bombings!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_resolve_the_paradox_desc: "Our republic, which loudly champions its tradition of political expression, is beholden to a most curious paradox. One of the main issues we encountered in the last year was our democracy being undermined by political organizations wholly interested in participating in electoralism with any measure of sincerity; seeing it as only a means to the eventual dismantlement of the republic in favor of a new, more authoritarian system.\n\nWhile we accept all manner of diverse ideologies, those who make it their objective to destroy democracy cannot be allowed to operate within the republican framework in good faith, for they intend to abuse our tolerance and use it as a weapon against us. Anti-electoralist parties and so-called \"revolutionary\" movements will be cracked down upon, to ensure the continued fostering of democratic ideals."
 KOM_DSNP_election_a_fairer_course_desc: "At the end of the day, we cannot forget the core platform that every member of the DSNP has pledged to uphold. Our mission here in Komi is the realization of socialism through democratic means, and the creation of an egalitarian society in which no voice goes unheard. Despite the efforts of the far-right to halt our progress, and the efforts of the far-left to hijack socialist ideals in favor of ruinous bolshevism, the path to achieving our ideals lies unimpeded. With the dark days behind us at last, let our party once again set a renewed course for socialism, with our proud republic as the sturdy vessel to take us there!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_streamline_public_assistance_desc: "It would be an understatement to say that Komi is not exactly a shining beacon of urban sophistication. It is a cold, wooded backwater that was, at one time, sparsely populated. With the tragic result of the Great Patriotic War, however, the province has seen a huge increase in activity due to refugees and migrants alike. This surge of life has also brought a heavy cost upon the food situation, and if nothing is done to alleviate this, a famine could be on the horizon.\n\nThe DSNP will work tirelessly to ensure that this does not come to pass. With the strengthening of the Republic's social net, no mouth shall go without food or water. This, along with the construction of new poorhouses will provide sanctuary to those who have none, will allow the foundations for a robust welfare state to continue with renewed impetus. When the people have food on their plates and a warm bed to call their own, none will deny that the DSNP is a party that looks out for the little man!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_army_of_peoples_will_desc: "A ragtag collection of paramilitaries with dubious loyalties to the republic will not bring peace to Russia. Our potential enemies all have well-drilled, professional forces that would surely rip right through our own without much difficulty. A true standing army of great size will be needed if we hope to stand a chance in the wars to come, one stripped clean of disloyal elements. All civilian defense organizations are to be rolled into the military at once, while those with ties to extremist paramilitaries will be turned away at the door. We will march as one, or we will not march at all."
 KOM_DSNP_election_turn_a_blind_eye_desc: "It is clear that the Republic's rather miniscule army is woefully outclassed by its rivals. While it was sufficient enough to maintain a semblance of territorial integrity, something much larger will be necessary to bring the warlords of Russia to heel. The republic does not have the luxury of choice: we'll need every gun available to point our enemies, even if they come from less-than-ideal sources. Syktyvkar is full of former paramilitaries who now find themselves without a job due to their extremist affiliations. If they are willing to join our fight to liberate Russia, we may just be able to overlook their past crimes..."
 KOM_DSNP_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "The dire state of our beloved motherland is certainly one of the great tragedies of the modern age. Petty warlords now pick apart the carcass of a once-proud nation, and only through great military effort can these carrion birds of disorder be swept away. We must begin our journey down the arduous road to reunification at once, lest Russia slide too far into chaos to be dragged back out again.\n\nThe military will need a great deal of funding to prepare for the days of constant warfare to come, and it is for this reason that the DSNP will propose the National Reclamation Act to the Assembly. Should it pass, the Republic will have all the resources they need to bring the pacification of West Russia to a swift conclusion, be it by the pen or the sword."
 KOM_DSNP_election_the_inspiration_of_our_predecessors_desc: "The great campaign to reunify all of Russia's remaining territories west of the Urals looms, and questions have already been raised on how to raise the capital to pay for the exorbitantly expensive business of war. To simplify the process, a centralized Soviet-inspired model has been selected to help manage the transition into a war economy. A specialized department for economic planning will allow the state to carefully guide national and private enterprises to uniformly aid the war effort. A \"communistic\" model may come across as distasteful to more conservative elements, but we do not have time to experiment with economic systems when war is on the horizon."
 KOM_DSNP_election_a_supervisory_model_desc: "The uncertainty of war hangs in the air as the reunification campaign nears, but that does not mean we do not have the time to sort out an ideal economic model. Not only is war very expensive, but the new territories will require a period of financial reconfiguring, and it would be best to plan ahead now rather than later. There are some who have proposed a centralized communist-inspired model for this; some who have clearly forgotten the misrule of the Communist Party! What the Republic truly needs is a council of businessmen, bureaucrats, and workers to supervise the growth of the war economy, not a faceless government agency to retread the mistakes of Bukharin!"
 KOM_DSNP_election_for_prosperity_and_justice_desc: "Though lingering doubts remain, President Voznesensky has proven that the trust of the electorate was not unfounded. In only a short period he has breathed new life into the Republic's democratic traditions, and ensured the continued fostering of democratic socialism. The darkness of the past is well behind us thanks to his efforts and the efforts of the DSNP, but now we must face the uncertainty of the future.\n\nIt is now time to prepare for war. The Komi Republic may be a shining beacon of democracy and prosperity, but the rest of West Russia remains clouded by the choking mist of warlordism. It falls to us to spread the light of democracy to the rest of the region, no matter what it takes. Our enemies are many, but so long as we fight with the workers and citizens of the Republic in our hearts, Russia will emerge from these dark times as a united and free nation!"

 KOM_PSD_election_the_stalina_presidency_desc: "The election of Svetlana Stalina as President of the Komi Republic has brought a mixture of uncertainty, trepidation, hope - and fear - to the nation.\n\nHer election has solidified the rightward shift of the Republic, but more importantly, is viewed as an indictment of the ineffective establishment politics of the previous government - and the extremists who sought to take advantage of it. Yet instead of flocking to extremists promising lies, the people choose stability.\n\nThese extremists appraise her warily, for they know the danger she poses to them. At the same time, the rest of the nation knows Stalina as a staunchly principled democrat - one who will prevent the collapse of the state through all necessary means. She will bring an end to the chaos - and restore stability to the Republic."
 KOM_PSD_election_democratic_salvation_desc: "Democracy in Komi rests on the edge of an abyss.\n\nCriminals and paramilitaries roam the streets. Extremists spew their rhetoric with little pushback. Lies and propaganda are commonplace. The previous government oversaw the slow crumbling of democracy in Komi, and did nothing to reverse its collapse.\n\nTheir cowardice nearly doomed the Republic. Stalina and the PSD will not make the same mistakes. They will pull back the Republic from this abyss, and make their policy clear to the nation. No matter how much they must intervene, democracy will be protected from those who seek its destruction."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_line_has_been_crossed_desc: "Fascists. Nazis. Communists. Ideologies of extremism, both conventional and esoteric, have not only found a foothold in the Republic, but have been able to flourish. They have been allowed to masquerade as legitimate political movements, and this legitimacy made the previous government reluctant to crack down on them.\n\nHowever, these movements are not legitimate. They are a poison to the Republic, and their actions following the election have crossed a line. This state of insurgency, conflict, and chaos will not be allowed to continue. Stalina and the PSD will convene to determine a solution to this problem - and subsequently, take action."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_kuratov_dossier_desc: "The Kuratov District of Syktyvkar has been notoriously ungovernable since the inception of the Republic. Communist paramilitaries have maintained strict control over all that goes on, and it is the primary stronghold of Suslov and his associates. Previous governments have washed their hands of Kuratov, and were unwilling to take action - but we will directly address this problem.\n\nNo one in Kuratov is clean, and that presents an opening. A dossier will be commissioned, demonstrating the corruption and criminality of every public official that is, or has served. For now, this will serve as a consolidated collection of blackmail material and criminal evidence - but it will be crucial to our plans for the future.\n\nKuratov will be brought under control, and Suslov's machinations will be ended."
 KOM_PSD_election_a_word_in_our_ears_desc: "President Stalina is deeply conscious of the importance of security - and wise enough to not blind herself to inconvenient facts.\n\nShe is aware of the reality that the government has been infiltrated by those who are firmly anti-democratic, as well as adherents of other extremist ideologies. This risk must be mitigated, before it rots our government from within.\n\nThere are several elements of the military whose loyalty to the Republic is unquestioned. Petro Grigorenko and his staff are among our best and we will give them greater authority and trust to undertake certain measures to protect the Republic. With Petro's advice, and the intensification of military intelligence operations against extremist movements, we will keep a close watch on them - and ensure the Republic remains protected."
 KOM_PSD_election_uncap_the_dogwhistle_desc: "The Passionariyy has long been one of the greatest threats to the Republic. Headquartered within the infamous Internatsionalnaya Street, and surrounding districts, they are a haven of intolerance, nationalism, and extremism cloaked in dogwhistles and the controlled language of \"moderate\" media networks.\n\nIt is time to dispel this deception.\n\nWe will nationalize Radio Free Syktyvkar, the largest and most legitimate of the Passionariyy's media outlets to silence their lies. At the same time, we will conduct an investigation on Igor Shafarevich, and conduct an audit into his finances while following his movements.\n\nHis crimes will be exposed, and with his downfall, the Passionariyy will soon follow."
 KOM_PSD_election_a_final_demand_desc: "Despite their electoral defeat, the extremists were undeterred in their quest for power - And they had reason to think this. Previous governments coddled and permitted them to act against the elected government without consequences. Unwritten rules were obeyed, corruption was the norm, and violence was tolerated. We will not be so lenient, and we have not been idle.\n\nLegal measures are identified. Blackmail is collected. Military loyalty is assured. The state is controlled. We have prepared long enough. It is time to act. We will present an ultimatum to the more \"legitimate\" sides of these extremists, and make them force their paramilities to stand down.\n\nIn return for their cooperation, they will survive - but they will be rendered impotent. For now, this is acceptable to restore stability."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_most_dangerous_game_desc: "Despite the time that has passed since the elections, the extremists retain their ambitions of overthrowing our government. There is unfortunately only one solution remaining - to declare martial law, and solve this problem permanently.\n\nWe will deploy the military to Syktvyakar and break the forces there apart, occupy and protect the neighborhoods, and restore control over the government. While this will end the extremist issue - it is admittedly a gamble.\n\nThe military will not be united, and we will be establishing a precedent for future military intervention. This will also no doubt generate significant resentment in the Republic, and cause damage to Syktyvkar itself - but Komi can heal from this. Better we suffer a reputational blow than allow extremism to continue to fester."
 KOM_PSD_election_sovereign_reformism_desc: "The Komi Republic is fundamentally flawed, unstable, and possesses critical weaknesses - ones which even the PSD has contributed to. Ours is a party that proudly upholds the traditions of the past, and are unapologetically patriotic for our nation - however, even the most zealous among our party have realized the danger of excess, and that the need for reform is real. And it is these reforms that Stalina will implement.\n\nDespite the flaws and issues of the Republic, it does not have to be this way. We will bring the Republic to its true potential, step by step. Reformation may be slow, but we will set the nation on the path towards stability, and will ensure that the Republic can truly be a sovereign power which proudly upholds the legacy of Russia."
 KOM_PSD_election_guarantee_public_assistance_desc: "The first welfare system in Komi was first built by the DSNP as a means of providing a lifeline for citizens who needed it. The intentions were good, but unfortunately, this program is deeply flawed. It is extremely restricted, underfunded, corrupt, slow, and riddled with accusations of political favoritism, all of which has rendered the system effectively useless.\n\nWe will do this properly.\n\nThere are many people in the Republic who have been left behind, through circumstances that are no fault of their own. It is our responsibility to ensure that these people are taken care of. We will establish a true welfare system, making sure those who truly need it receive support, be it food, clothing, or housing."
 KOM_PSD_election_salvation_through_service_desc: "The unfortunate truth is that the Republic lies in a very precarious position, and is surrounded by enemies who would seek our destruction. We do not have the luxury of rectifying every previous government failure; not when we face invasion from our neighbors. Nonetheless, while we cannot provide full relief for less-fortunate citizens, we can offer something - something that will also improve our national situation.\n\nWe will reform the existing welfare programs, and tie them to public service. Be it public administration, law enforcement, or military service, we need people to fill these positions. These extra benefits will be appealing, and strengthen our state through alleviating manpower shortages. Finally, we will ensure that our veterans are fully taken care of - for what does it say of a nation who lets those who served so loyally languish when their service ends?"
 KOM_PSD_election_investigate_discrimination_allegations_desc: "It has come to our attention that there are numerous reports of systemic abuse and discrimination of minorities by the state apparatus, from law enforcement, the military, and even public services. Despite the fact that these are full and equal citizens of the Republic, we must face the uncomfortable fact that such discrimination is alive and well in the state.\n\nThis is, of course, intolerable, and Stalina and the PSD will not let it continue.\n\nA state that allows its own citizens to be treated in such a way is undisciplined, weak, and abusive - and will set us down the path of ruin. We will immediately investigate these allegations, and excise these criminals from the state body. There is no tolerance for this behavior under Stalina's administration - not now. Not ever."
 KOM_PSD_election_spare_the_rod_desc: "We are aware of reports of abuse and discrimination by state apparatuses against some of the minorities of the Republic. After internal deliberation, it was determined that the potential risks and costs of a major investigation would be too great to justify. While the allegations are disturbing, a comprehensive response would be unnecessary, and potentially destabilize the nation and party cohesion.\n\nThat does not mean we will do nothing, of course. There are several truly heinous reports we will take action against - but the claim that these criminals are representative of systemic abuse? No. Such accusations are unfounded, and we cannot discount that they are being spread by our enemies to destabilize our state.\n\nThe Republic is united, fair, and lawful - and under Stalina, it always will be."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "Russia must be reunited. Despite all of the differences between the factions of the Republic, everyone agrees on this fundamental fact. Much discussion has been had on what must be done, and now is the time to put words into action, and begin orienting our state for this monumental task.\n\nThe National Reclamation Act will be introduced into the National Assembly. This act will properly fund our production, expand our industries, codify regulations for military operation, and distribute resources, manpower, and funding to our diplomatic and integration agencies in preparation for reclaiming Russia.\n\nRussia has been broken for too long. By our efforts, she will be united once more."
 KOM_PSD_election_the_hardest_of_bargains_desc: "Much of the Republic's economy is under the control of several large industrial magnates - a situation that resulted from deals and understandings between the magnates and previous administrations. Now the magnates wield significant control over the national economy - but they are ultimately reliant on the government to maintain their stranglehold.\n\nThe magnates for a long time now have only been concerned with their own profit, and have become complacent and arrogant. It is time they be reminded of who they serve. We hold significant leverage of the magnates, and we will use this to force them to work for the Republic once more - and guide their efforts towards state projects, efforts, and solutions.\n\nThey will comply, or they will be broken apart and given to those more loyal."
 KOM_PSD_election_convince_the_magnates_desc: "Much of the Republic's economy is controlled by several large industrial magnates, who provide steady jobs, resources, and weapons for the state. While they are certainly more motivated by profit than patriotism, none can say they have failed to meet their obligations - ones the result of dealings with previous governments.\n\nThe magnates are not, nor need to be, our enemy - however, we do have our own expectations for them.\n\nWe will sit down with the magnates, and negotiate new contracts and agreements with them. We can be reasonable, and they know that it is in their interests to work with us to ensure our mission to reunify Russia is properly supplied. If we throw in a few extra incentives? Their willing support will be assured, which will make the state more stable in the long-term."
 KOM_PSD_election_towards_sovereignty_desc: "Through pressure, subtlety, negotiation, and resolve, we have successfully been able to advance every single critical policy forward, and unified the Republic under Stalina's leadership. Though difficult and intensive, our efforts have paid off, and the sovereignty of the Komi Republic is not only secure - it is stronger than ever.\n\nNow, we look beyond our borders.\n\nOur people are eager. Our military is prepared. The Komi Republic mobilizes for war. All necessary measures are in place. We are as ready as we can ever be. No more excuses or delays. The unification of Russia will begin, and we shall see it through to the end."

To the Communist Party.\n\nThis is a great occasion, a shift further towards Communism from old DSNP rule. This proves the people no longer wish to commit to defeatism when the fallen Red Banner of Struggle, of the Working Man, lies ready to be taken up once more.\n\nNow will be a time of struggle, hardship, and self-sacrifice. But the KPK's election demonstrates the willingness of the population to endure this brief period, to tighten their belts for Russias survival. It has only begun."
 KOM_KPK_election_socialism_for_the_people_desc: "We have been tasked with the great work of seeing Soviet economics triumph. This economic revolutions victory will see the general improvement of material living conditions, after all. There are, however, those who will invariably turn out to be traitors. It is clear to all with eyes the bourgeois will never sit idly, and allow themselves to pass into history. They never do.\n\nIt must be done all the same. There are those who would extend leniency to bourgeois specialists, and afford them greater luxury, so they can help build the revolution. Once we enact the economic revolution, the upper class will show their true face, and the people will see the reason for our distrust."
 KOM_KPK_election_entrap_the_magnates_desc: "The party has employed several strategies over the decades of the struggles existence, complementing material conditions and the circumstances of the day. Once, the NEP was employed to eliminate the peasantry in favor of small capitalists. Now, our designs and works have a new target. The fat hands of the citys business magnates hold key government ties. This cannot stand.\n\nThe KPK shall pass a slew of new labor laws to squeeze these Magnates. They will be nigh impossible for the employer to fulfill. This prosecution against the monopolist-capitalist will allow the rise of worker-controlled enterprises. The Party has no choice. The private and exploitative merchant must meet its end so the Revolution can live."

What place do complications have in times like these? We are not trying to confuse the upper classes.\n\nThe KPK's paramilitaries and agents, having spent years cutting their teeth against the Right-Guardists, shall begin their true campaign. Through these arms, the Party will work tirelessly to seize that which has been stolen from the worker, and directly redistribute it back to their empty hands. The people of Komi has vested the Party with power, and now we must use it in their interest, blocking any and all resistance to this redistribution campaign."
 KOM_KPK_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "The KPK government will send an act to the National Assembly for passage. As the Party concludes its internal campaigns, it must look outwards. The components of this National Reclamation Act will be the issuing of funding and allowances to allow for the bolstering of our military. There can only be one direction for this effort. Russia will be whole under the Red banner again.\n\nDespite how such measures would be pursued under any sane party, this will be opposed. Our actions to secure the revolution were never intended to make friends out of inextricable enemies within the National Assembly. Nevertheless, we know their obstruction will come. We must endure it if the candlelight that is our grief for Russia is to amount to anything."

About Law and Order, about an abstract ancient order, about something our Party practically by mere existence. It was not their order that held sway for 20 years. Meanwhile, the centuries that preceded that were a dark time of ignorance and petty terrorizing despots. The Party speaks to a higher order. The Highest Order.\n\nState control of the economy will be re-initialized. This entails the restoration of the Gosplan planning committee, which will implement the directives outlined by the Government of the Party. They will supervise the ebbs and flows of the economy while subordinating all state-owned enterprises to their power."
 KOM_KPK_election_free_the_modern_serfs_desc: "The history books tell us some jumped-up Tsar with delusions of benevolence freed the serfs. Our eyes tell us a different story, as do our decyphering minds. One serfdom has given way to another. The form and method have merely changed their skins. Tyrannic whims of private merchants, dancing the carrot before the common farmer, will not hold further sway.\n\nThe Party will meet out well-deserved land reform to the nations farming class. With the KPK at the head of this Republic, we shall see to it that the farmers are empowered. Of course, this allocation of greater autonomy to the farming communities will also go a great way to currying support from them. In the coming years, and the coming wars, that support will be essential."
 KOM_KPK_election_to_build_a_new_world_desc: "At last, with the opposition destroyed and our grip on power affirmed, we can move towards ending the oppressive Republic. The final step in removing the bourgeoise will commence, as reactionary elements are purged under a final communist revolution. With this, we will declare the Komi Soviet Republic in the ashes of where the old republic once stood.\n\nHowever, there still exist monarchists, revisionists, and actual fascists surrounding us. Once our grip on power is finally secured, we will have to soon protect our revolution from those outside our borders. To achieve this we will shift our attention to unifying the entirety of West Russia."

 KOM_RNP_election_a_compassionate_state_desc: "ロシア国民党綱領の主要な部分は、思いやりのある国家という概念であった。このモデルは、国家が普通の市民で構成されており、同胞のニーズを受容していることを想定している。我々だけが我が市民の将来とコミ国家の最善の道を知っているため、市民のニーズはすべて我が慈悲深い政府が面倒を見ることになる。\n\nこれは我々の政策目標の中で最初に行われる改革となるだろう。前政府の冷たく落胆させられるアプローチは、我々の常に思いやりのあるアプローチに置き換えられるだろう。またこれは、ボリシェヴィキの堕落から市民をさらに守り、彼らが我々の考え方を理解することを助けるだろう。"
 KOM_RNP_election_end_the_bolshevik_legacies_desc: "共産主義者は我々や前政府と違って共和国を適切に支配することに失敗したにもかかわらず、彼らのの影響がコミでの生活の至る所に存在している。その一部は反発する共産主義者によって行われた破壊行為によるものだが、しかし大部分は過去のブハーリンが率いたボリシェヴィキ政権の影響が残部である。\n\n今こそ脱共産化の長いプロセスを開始する時だ。物理的な面では、紋章から銅像に至るまでソ連の象徴的なものを取り除いて破壊していく。同様に労働組合が持つ急進的な傾向から、同志という言葉の単純使用まで、日常生活におけるその影響も除去していく。真に民族的ロシアを目指す我々の探求において、それは何も残すことができない。"
 KOM_RNP_election_recentered_welfare_desc: "ブハーリンとレーニン時代のソビエトが残した卑劣な政策の一つに、アファーマティブ・アクションがある。これによってある種の不相応で無知な集団が完全で有能な市民から福祉や仕事を奪ってきたのだ。一方複数の村で、福祉を必要とする人々がネグレクトされたゆえに、苦しみながら飢えている。\n\n今日、この惨めな慣習を終わらせよう！地理的条件や孤立が問題を引き起こす場合を例外として、成功は努力によって決まる。もはや少数民族が我々から何も奪うことはなく、代わりに政府の予算は地方で孤立している人々を助けることに向けられるだろう。そうすれば人種や信条に関係なく、誰もが真に平等な社会となる。"
 KOM_RNP_election_the_labourers_reward_desc: "前政権の無頓着で、吝嗇で、飄逸した性質は、我が市民の生活に悲惨な影響を与えた。特に働けないほど衰えた老人を放置してきたことは、国家のために多くを捧げてきた市民に破滅的であった。我らの老齢労働者や退役軍人は、我が党が彼らにしてあげられる善なることを享受することができずに、無関心な貧困の中で暮らしている。\n\n以前から存在する国内の地下勢力によって押し付けられている貧困から懸命に働く人々を守るために、国家の思いやりによる数々の社会福祉制度を制定する。定年退職者が仕事を失ったときに役立つ制度によって、ようやく安らぎを見出すことができるようになる。同様に退役軍人にも年金の支給を開始し、彼らの愛国的な奉仕が報われるようにする予定だ。"
 KOM_RNP_election_the_national_reclamation_act_desc: "そろそろ我々は海外情勢に、少なくとも我々に近所に目を向けるべき時が来ている。戦争の雲は急速に近づきつつあり、それは間もなく我々の国境に到達するだろう。我々の提出する国家再建法案は、ロシア再統一運動において、我が栄光ある軍隊と忠実な外交団の両方に予算と法的保障を提供することで、この問題に関して我々を援助するものだ。\n\n残念ながら、非国民で臆病な国民議会の野党どもはこの法案を支持しそうにない。彼らは我々の最近の行動に関して、「過激だ」「民主主義への脅威だ」などという突飛な主張をしている。このような主張が我々と協力することを思いとどまらせているのだ。彼らの国家に対する反逆は今に始まったことではないが、法案成立をさせる際には念頭に置かなければならないだろう。"
 KOM_RNP_election_triumph_of_purpose_desc: "来るべき戦争に備え、経済においてどこに優先させるべきで、誰が影響力を持つべきかという重要な判断をしなければならない。その際、イデオロギー的一貫性の必要性に焦点を置かなければならない。軍隊に十分な食料を与え、民衆を飢えさせないためには農業経済を活性化させることが重要だ。この優先順位は環境主義を掲げるRNPの歴史的な綱領と一致しており、農村の有権者に焦点を当てるものである。\n\nしかしこの決断には代償が伴う。農業を重視することは、我々は同時に我が国の経済における産業資本家の力を抑制することになる。すべてを支配するあの財界人たちの政治的影響力を制限することは党を強化することになるため、今やこれには利点があるといえる。しかし彼らの支持を得られないことは、産業経済における強さを我々は失うことになる。"
 KOM_RNP_election_sacrifice_for_common_good_desc: "このような時代には、時に困難な決断を下さなければならない。魂と我が政府を定義する尺度はより大いなる善のための犠牲となる。今がその時だ。我々は産業界の財界人が政府のリソースを利用することを嫌々ながら許可することになる。これはいかにも他の売国政党がやりそうなことだが、この場合は統一の必要性から愛国的な行動とみなされるべきだ。\n\nしかしこの決定は農業部門と農村の支持基盤を犠牲にすることになる。国家に無視された勤勉な農民の労苦に我々は長く耐えなければならない。さらに経済全体に対する我々の支配力も弱まり、不都合な勢力の侵入を許すことになる。もちろんいずれはこの支配力を取り戻すことができるだろうが、当面は問題になるであろう。"
 KOM_RNP_election_the_dream_realized_desc: "コミの支配権を確保するために必要な行いはすべて達成された。我々は政府機構を、我が党の真の愛国的なロシア人だけが政府にアクセスできるようにする組織に変貌させた。共産主義の腐った死体は国家から除去され、我々を出し抜いていた恐ろしく臆病な反逆者たちは権力のあらゆる地位から首尾よく取り除かれた。\n\nこの新たな安全保障によって、我々は重要なことにしっかりと焦点を移すことができる。すなわち西ロシア全域の再統一だ。戦争の雲はついに我々の国境に到達しており、攻撃の時が来たのだ！旧ソビエト連邦領の他の地域にもこの思いやりに満ちた国家を広めるには、今がその時なのである。"

 KOM_dem_smuta_the_republic_triumphant_desc: "There was a moment - a brief moment, for just a day or two, but a moment - when we all felt doomed. Flanked by authoritarian forces on each side, faced with internal debate instead of unity, the people of Komi lost their hope for their republic.\n\nThough we lived, all of us remember that feeling. Hopelessness - it must become an alien thought to the people of Komi. They need safety and security. They need institutions they can trust. They need a state they can rely on.\n\nWe have won today. We must make certain we win tomorrow."
 KOM_dem_smuta_restoring_the_foundation_desc: "In the wake of such a massive insurrection, our civil institutions, the backbone of our democracy, are shot. Whether it be problems with staffing, fear of violence, or outright chaos, most departments of the government are hampered. Despite our victory, Komi remains without order.\n\nWhile it may not be as romantic a notion as restoring democracy, restoring order is our first and utmost priority. A stable and functional state is the core of our society, as in any proper nation. Without it, we will fall to ruin - and all our democratic ideals will crumble with us."
 KOM_dem_smuta_monopoly_on_violence_desc: "When communists and fascists attempted to overwhelm our nation, they did it with more than their scribblings and shouts. They did it with guns. They amassed a horde of weapons under the protection of our open gun laws, and with them, they sabotaged our nation and brought us to the brink of collapse.\n\nIt is clear that such slack cannot remain in the system. Through a system of tight gun control, we must defang any deviant still hoping to destroy our democracy. The radicals will keep their right to free speech and free thought, but they must relinquish their right to free firepower. It is up to our government to hold its weapons tight - and its people close."
 KOM_dem_smuta_register_civilian_firearms_desc: "How do we rid our streets of violence? The obvious answer is to take away the tools of such violence, but in the whirling madness of Russia this is a fool's gambit. We are starved for manpower, starved for weapons, starved for resources to conduct such a mass confiscation. Yet there is a cleaner way.\n\nWe will make certain that all citizens register their firearms, while banning any further sales of this nature. Those with weapons will be registered automatically to the territorial defense forces - they are well-versed in arms, after all. It may not be as simple as a flat confiscation, but this subtler method may work a whole lot better."
 KOM_dem_smuta_formalize_national_claims_desc: "What is the Komi Republic? Certainly, it is for more than just the Komi people - our leadership are primarily Russian, and have never imagined themselves as a smaller national state. Yet for all this time, we have left unclear just how much land we claim.\n\nWith the Russian Civil War burning bright, the time to stake our claim has come. Though imperfect, the USSR's smaller Russian state serves as a functional boundary for a Russian state, free of imperialism. Other former imperial territories will also be allowed to join, but only at their discretion. Finally, we can sing in one voice - we are Russia, and Russia will be saved."
 KOM_dem_smuta_redefine_election_cycles_desc: "War is no time for an election. Our territories change daily with the tides of Smuta. Our people risk death if they stray too close to a polling station. For many, our lives are too chaotic, too complex, to fit in the arduous complexities of the democratic model. We need stability and strength, and for the moment, an election would provide neither.\n\nInstead, the Assembly has agreed to a delay on elections until the situation west of the Urals has stabilized, or until four years have passed, whichever comes first. It is only at that point that we will integrate our new lands into the democratic model. Until then, we await the day that the light of liberty will touch all corners of our territory."
 KOM_dem_smuta_reinforce_census_apparatus_desc: "The Komi Republic's weak civilian agencies extended to many tasks, including that of the census. Our previous censuses were confusing, arcane, and worst of all inaccurate, creating maps with little practical use to our government. We were left to work half-blind, and fix their mistakes as they come.\n\nNow, our administrative overhauls can remodel this archaic system. Our old censuses will be redone from scratch, properly reflecting the population of the Komi republic. For new territories, our ethnographers will fall in lockstep with our soldiers, charting our lands as we take them. Only through these bold methods shall we gain a true understanding of just who lives in our republic."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_priorities_of_the_assembly_desc: "The matters of state are already known to us. Our forces move to liberate a great patch of Russia. Our enemies flicker and fratter, destroying much of the nation in the process. It appears for now that we are succeeding Yet we cannot forget that there is more to our republic than simply the boons of our military victory.\n\nThe National Assembly, newly elected, must carry on in its stated mission. It cannot simply conduct a war - it must conduct a nation, one which is determined to develop the Republic into a true nation. Our democracy must now do its mission - and we will all be better for it."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_king_of_cups_desc: "The news, the radicals, even many members of the DSNP, all seemed to believe that President Voznesensky might not just be the end of the party, but of democracy itself. Yet on the other side, we can see that these enemies and scandals were mere blips on a career of success. The Komi Republic sails steady, with the President firmly in the captain's quarters.\n\nNow, he must repeat the same trick with a new base - the Russians that Komi recently liberated. These citizens of Russia often lived poor and starving, oppressed by governents whose only care was for their own demented ideals. To win their hearts, they must be given the things they need."
 KOM_dem_smuta_to_end_the_hunger_desc: "Like the horsemen of the Bible, Famine rides alongside War. Western Russia has felt the wrath of war - now, it shudders in the grip of famine. Families lost their farms or their yields to marching soldiers, or key workers to the battles themselves. It comes to us, their liberators, to lend a hand.\n\nBy nationalizing food stockpiles collected across the nation, there may be a suitable amount of food to let everyone survive these harsh times. We will use our army, already stationed around the nation, to distribute rations to civilian channels, and then, the people. Finally, we will rid our lands of these hideous horsemen."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_industrial_distribution_act_desc: "Written by a cadre of the most elite DSNP lawmakers, the Industrial Distribution Act appears to be a powerful instrument in the hands of the worker. According to the law, should a workplace in the reclaimed territories employ over fifty individuals, it will immediately pass into collective ownership by the workers.\n\nBy passing such a measure, the DSNP hopes to break the economic grip that recently acquired firms might have on our democracy. If this passes, Komi will be one step closer to the socialist system which President Voznesensky has always promised."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_page_of_pentacles_desc: "モロゾフ大統領、彼自身が過去からの脱却の意味を持つ。スムータからの脱却、軍閥からの脱却、そして未だ我々を脅かすかつてのソビエトの腐敗からの脱却。しかし、今重要なのは過去を顧みることではない。未来を見ることだ。すなわち、モロゾフの、そして我ら自身の未来である。\n\n大統領はロシアを立ち上がらせるための、血や暴力に頼らない、ただ組織に頼った計画を立てている。ロシアに急進的イデオロギーという毒や死んだ夢は要らず、学校や病院、工場や農場が代わりに必要である。機械化を推進する。成長をもたらす。腕を開いて我らを迎える未来の中に、我々は安息の地を見つけ出す。"
 KOM_dem_smuta_to_construct_the_future_desc: "As we reclaim this side of the Urals, we must revive it as well. Locked in the grip of dangerous warlords, these regions were often underdeveloped, unable to join the modern world. We will fix this.\n\nFactories will be built, reactivating the region with infrastructure in mind. As the military is currently in these regions, it stands that they are the appropriate mechanism to begin these projects - their men will begin what the locals will soon complete. Our goal is extreme, but very much doable - every Russian in our lands will have the right to work."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_technical_development_act_desc: "The Technical Development Act is a perfect summary of Morozov's wide-eyed vision. The plan envisions a scientific side to the republic's industrial capacity, generously funded, able to work without the red tape of excessive bureaucracy and a million watching eyes.\n\nThe private sector will have generous routes to new material in the form of newly reclaimed industry. Infrastructure that they need to create valuable materials can be provided slickly and efficiently, creating a frictionless road to a more visionary future. Someday, the Technical Development Act will be seen as the first leap towards an intelligent Russia of Tomorrow - one we will all count on."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_queen_of_swords_desc: "共和国国民は新たな指導者をその手で選んだ。スヴェトラーナ・ヨシフォヴナ・スターリナ新大統領は有能かつ意欲ある女性で、かつての粗野なポピュリストに打って変わって清風をスィクティフカルへともたらした。\n\nしかしその女王は、自らの行為と国家にのみ忠実だ。スターリナは急速な再軍備と領土回復の計画をもって、かつて国を残酷に引き裂いた急進主義者から祖国を守ろうとしている。彼女はロシアを安定しより良い、新たな地へと建て直すだろう。ロシアは常に、超大国の地位を約束されている。剣のクイーン、スターリナの下でその約束はなしえるだろう。"
 KOM_dem_smuta_to_embolden_the_nation_desc: "The people of Russia are tired of war. Trapped in an eternal battle, they feel lorded over by armies, foreign forces who pillage their lands and give little in return. Decades of poor rule by poor rulers have drained the morale from the people of Russia.\n\nYet this is no reason to give up the fight. Instead, we must bridge the gap between our military and our people. Through recruitment campaigns, we can bring the people closer to their army. Through military reconstruction and service, we can show the people how their soldiers can come to their aid. Through improved training, we can be certain our army is loyal and just. In time, the people will come to see just how good their army truly is."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_independent_supervisory_act_desc: "One problem which rapid expansion creates is a lack of administration. Komi was, after all, only ever set up to administer a small region, not a fifth of all of Russia. Even holding votes is impossible while borders shift and surveys are unreliable. Instead, we may wish to rely on a simpler method.\n\nThe Independent Supervisory Act gives the Republican Army the ability to independently appoint local civilian officials to govern the newly reclaimed territory, as well as giving the civilian government access to reports on the frontline. Through these policies, the government and military can work harmoniously on the frontlines, without the redundancies required by attempting an unwieldy civilian administration."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_march_of_the_multitudes_desc: "From an outsider's viewpoint it might seem as though there are many individual warlords with valid claims to being the true Russia. If so, they would be strongly mistaken. Even disregarding the fact that many of these statelets are run by selfish despots or outright criminals, it is clear that it is our Republic - and only our Republic - that truly represents the will of the Russian people.\n\nWe are beset on all sides by monarchists, military governments, and Nazis. Do they represent the people who choke under their yoke? Certainly not. As the true democracy - the best representation of the will of the people - it is our duty to maintain unity as we work to restore Russia."
 KOM_dem_smuta_sowing_the_seeds_desc: "As we begin the reclamation, a long list of tasks presents itself. We need to re-integrate the rest of Russia and make use of new land, utilize the new factories and involve the new people. It has become quite clear to us that what worked when we were small is insufficient as we continue to grow.\n\nWe must begin to reorient our economy, and the sooner, the better, considering the amount of work that needs to be done. It may be thankless work now, but the people will be grateful to us for having done it."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_citizen_soldier_desc: "Simply put, we do not have the population to maintain a large standing army. Fortunately, this problem is somewhat alleviated by the fact that many civilians already serve in our territorial defense forces. Some particularly enthusiastic ones have even been assisting the military in some of its operations.\n\nThis is good, and presents an opportunity for further expansion. Even if theyre not on the front, we must emphasize that it is every citizen's duty to defend their country and provide for the soldiers who protect it."
 KOM_dem_smuta_return_to_fundamentals_desc: "If we are to be successful in reclaiming West Russia - let alone all of the Motherland - we must bring the military up to modern standards, using whatever means we have. We will need to renew the army's leadership, while promoting new perspectives where we can. The army must become more professional, more disciplined, and more organized.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we will have to address the legacy of paramilitaries in our armed forces. Many of our soldiers came from quite radical backgrounds - therefore, we will need to instill discipline in them. To this end, they will be placed under the watchful eyes of our most reliable officers.\n\nSoon, they will understand who is in control here - and what is, and isn't acceptable."
 KOM_dem_smuta_foster_working_relationships_desc: "Our current manpower shortage means that we cannot be particularly choosy about who we choose to recruit. Many irregular units - primarily paramilitaries - are outside our chain of command, but will, without question, give us more mobilized manpower if integrated into our own forces.\n\nThis does not come without risk. We are integrating these men with few strings attached: many of these fighters were radicals who will bring problematic influences into our military, potentially undermining us. Nonetheless, we need men to fight, and these risks are worth the boost our armed forces will receive."
 KOM_dem_smuta_a_centered_capital_desc: "With the city of Vyatka now firmly in our hands, we can now begin the process of moving our capital there. It is in a significantly better location than Syktyvkar, and it will provide a suitable place to both organize our administration and prepare for future conflicts.\n\nVyatka has great potential: we will turn it into a proper center of government. Our most immediate task is to repair the damage from the war, but we'll also need to remove any imperial influences and fortify the city - preferably as soon as possible."
 KOM_dem_smuta_consolidate_gained_resources_desc: "West Russia has been void of productivity for the previous two decades. Not only has it been under constant aerial assault from Germany - but it has been managed improperly by fiefdoms and their masters who have had no concern for the wellbeing or will of their people. This ends now! With large swathes of land under our control, we now have the ability to make greater investments and build up what was lost. Industry, businesses, enterprise, infrastructure and all the necessities for a modern state are desperately needed.\n\nIt is the state's duty to ensure that our society provides for all of its people. Our actions and investments today and in the following years will decide whether we fulfil this promise, lest we fall again, either at the hands of other Russian pretenders who care only about power or worse - the Nazi menace."
 KOM_dem_smuta_the_whatever_constitution_desc: "Our burgeoning republic has faced countless foes, many being from inside our own territory. Thus a constitution becomes increasingly important. It will maintain and secure our core values of democracy, equality and Russian sovereignty - making it more difficult for a wannabe despot to subvert the state.\n\nThis new constitution will also further legitimize our government as the legal successor to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, not because we are communists, but because this was the last legally recognized entity that held power over Russia. We have learnt many lessons from this old regime - what led to its downfall and what elements of it were successful. May this be a day remembered for centuries to become, where a new Russia finally grew its wings and began to take flight."

With so many radicals opposing our government, and so many trials to process, reforms have to be made. President Stalina has authorized the powers of the judicial courts to be extended to the police precincts and military. This will allow for the police and military to set up courts of their own, so that extremists and criminals can be dealt with quickly and efficiently. While some may call this undemocratic, and fear that this will be used to purge anyone who disagrees with the government, it is simply the only way to proceed. Once the crisis has passed, we can discuss this matter in more depth."
 KOM_stal_smuta_make_an_example_desc: "Our government has recently captured several extremist paramilitaries, whose ideologies have cost the lives of countless innocent souls.

Yet in the wrong hands, these weapons could pose a threat to our brave soldiers. We shall have to conduct background checks on the citizen population, making sure there are none with extremist sympathies hiding in our midst, seizing the firearms of any who poses a threat. They will be much more useful in the hands of our men."
 KOM_stal_smuta_clear_the_streets_desc: "Street protests, violent crime, and other civil disturbances continue to plague our cities at precisely the time the campaign to restore Russia to greatness requires order and discipline. It is time to put a stop to such nonsense, by any means necessary. We will deploy the police, our greatest defence against anarchy, across the cities of Russia, and put an end to the chaos. Those who resist will be met with the full force of the law. Some will complain about the stripping of their liberties, but such people do not know that freedom can only be built on the basis of a secure, orderly society. They will learn."
 KOM_stal_smuta_the_crisis_calmed_desc: "Thankfully, due to all of our efforts to remove extremist ideas from our Republic the immediate crisis seems to have been calmed. However, there are still many radicals who may try to seize power as we expand into more territories. Similarly, as we come to control regions that were once under communist or despotist rule, we may be at risk of a partisan uprising. These territories that have never known democracy may not be in favor of our government. We should continue our efforts to educate these people and eliminate the threats of radicals and partisans, and we will not stop until our Republic is secured."
 KOM_stal_smuta_the_national_reconstruction_council_desc: "President Stalina needs a group of people to aid her in stabilizing Komi, and has found her solution in the form of the National Reconstruction Council. Its members consist of PSD politicians, police commanders, trade union leaders, and military officers, serving as an upper house of sorts for the Reconstruction Government. The Council will propose and pass policy during this time of crisis, give advice and consent to decisions made by the President, and have sole authority to ratify treaties. The National Reconstruction Council shall act as a parallel body to the National Assembly, but will be more reliable due to all of the members being appointed directly by the President herself."
 KOM_stal_smuta_guarantees_to_the_national_assembly_desc: "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. Some have even gone so far as to call President Stalina a dictator, and anti-democratic. What these critics don't seem to understand is that these are all temporary protective measures, to ensure that the Republic does not fall once again.\n\nTo combat these claims, President Stalina shall take a break from her busy schedule to promise that the National Assembly's power shall be returned shortly, and that the Reconstruction Government will be disbanded once the crisis has passed. Hopefully, this will end their useless panicking."
 KOM_stal_smuta_extend_emergency_powers_desc: "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. President Stalina has decided to refuse to guarantee the temporary nature of these policies, seeing it as unnecessary and a distraction from her busy schedule. Instead, President Stalina has chosen to extend her emergency powers indefinitely, and she will cease using them once they are no longer necessary. The Reconstruction Government operates on a need-to-know basis, and currently, that is all the National assembly needs to know. If they have a problem with this information, President Stalina suggests submitting a complaint to the National Reconstruction Council, who will address such complaints once there is enough time available to do so."
 KOM_stal_smuta_issue_the_fundamental_directives_desc: "The Komi Republic is beset on all sides by extremists, radicals and rabble-rousers who seek to undermine the stability of the nation, planning to destroy the rights of the common man in favour of building twisted \"utopias\" based on their ideas. This ends now. Only by issuing a series of Fundamental Directives that order their arrests and removals from society can we restore the stability that they destroyed. Who is an extremist will be decided later- what matters now is that they must be eliminated."
 KOM_stal_smuta_liquidate_anti_democratic_apparatus_desc: "With the continued consolidation of the Republic, it has become clear to the Reconstruction Government that democracy may not be restored promptly without more and more decisive action. The time for legislation and temporary police crackdowns is over - the time has come. We must rid ourselves of the Far-Left and the Far-Right, for good. Their members will be arrested. No matter how large they are, or irrelevant, they will be annihilated."
 KOM_stal_smuta_a_blueprint_for_integration_desc: "The more the Republic expands, the more difficult it is for us to properly integrate these new territories into the central government- that is, unless we come up with a distinct plan on how to train and send in new administrators into these territories in a swift but orderly manner. New departments and governments will need to be set up as soon as our armies conquer them, while leaders from regions peacefully incorporated into the state must be integrated into the government of Komi as soon as possible in order to create a stable platform for expansion."
 KOM_stal_smuta_democracy_is_non_negotiable_desc: "Nothing is more sacred on this Earth than the right for people to take part in the government, but despots and extremists refuse to recognise this. There are elements within the Republic who seek to agitate amongst the people to reform democracy away, or to paralyze our Republic in the name of an end which is fundamentally against the principles of freedom for all. Whilst they fly banners that proclaim a commitment to the rights of the worker, instead they seek to strip away the agency of that very worker into a amorphous collective, and to cast down the Republic that protects the people. Democracy is non-negotiable, and these thugs must learn this lesson the hard way, if need be."
 KOM_stal_smuta_the_road_to_enduring_freedom_desc: "The protection of liberty and democracy in the Republic was long and difficult; some agitators even claim that our methods go against the ideals that we have uphold so dearly. We cannot listen to these rabble-rousers. Since the inception of our nation, the freedom that is so much a part of Komi's identity was besieged by extremists within and without, and it will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. As long as it is under attack, we must endure that long road to freedom, facing whatever obstacle comes in our way with courage and determination."

 KOM_morozov_springtime_in_russia_desc: "The people of the Republic have spoken; SMR, standing for liberty, economic freedom and a government of common sense, has been elected. Our mandate has been given to us freely and fairly through majority, rather than through the shady politicking of the old Komi Republic.\n\nThe newly-inaugurated President Morozov has announced his intention to move ahead at once. Now that we no longer have to worry about the threat of paramilitaries, the business of governance can be carried out as it would be in any modern democracy. The long winter of discontent has ended, and freedom blooms anew from the soil of the Motherland."
 KOM_morozov_a_platform_for_democracy_desc: "The cornerstone of democratic success is majority rule. Though both reactionaries and far-left vanguardists deride this idea as 'mob rule', there is no more clear a survey of the people's desires than a free and open election. If a majority freely supports us, then the radicals have no grounds for their claims of 'elitism' so often lobbed at liberal democrats.\n\nThat the majority of voters reside in urban areas, the core support bases for liberal ideals, is irrelevant. Our popularity is perfectly natural, and we need no dirty tricks to explain our success. The notion that the votes of our support base are inherently of low value due to their sheer numbers is mere jealousy on the part of labor and conservative politicians."
 KOM_morozov_freedom_and_fairness_desc: "Though we always tried our best, the Komi Republic was never able to do right by its minorities. Even the eponymous Komi were often systematically denied a voice by racist elements of the Assembly. Now that Western Russia is under our banner, we have entire republics of non-Russians!\n\nWe are happy to have our brother peoples living and working alongside us, but their republics are much younger and more fragile than ours. Unsavory types, such as Voznesensky, have a vested interest in suppressing their voters, and that's to say nothing of what radicals might get up to. President Morozov has thus pledged to help build democratic institutions and carry out surveys of the minority republics, so that the interests of all citizens are fairly represented."
 KOM_morozov_survey_republic_elections_desc: "When even a single voter is denied their fundamental rights, democracy suffers. It might not seem so at the time, but every step away from guaranteed universal suffrage is a step towards totalitarianism. For a proper democracy, this will not do.\n\nEveryone, from the most hard-done-by farmer to the wealthiest urbanite, is of equal value in the democratic process. Neither the elitism of the far-right nor the rabid classism of the far-left will benefit our Republic. One citizen, one vote. With anything less, could we truly call ourselves a democracy?"
 KOM_morozov_learn_from_past_mistakes_desc: "In truth, the Russia that we have begun to build here in the west is not the same nation extinguished by the Germans two decades ago. Nor is it the Provisional Republic, or the Empire. Our republic is something different; an entirely new nation, born amidst the graves of its parents.\n\nAppropriately, our vision for Russia must be forward-thinking and idealistic. Past Russian states had their virtues, but all ultimately failed for a single reason: they refused to change. There was always some rigid ideological line to toe, some utopian obligation that could never be fulfilled. Our republic will not make the same mistakes. We are trying something new, focusing on the practical needs of the present rather than a future that exists only in the dreams of ideologues, or a past that led Russia to destruction several times over."
 KOM_morozov_towards_a_shining_future_desc: "It's never easy to move on. Russia has much to be proud of in its past, but there is just as much about our history that is sordid and shameful. There was always someone waiting in the wings to lead us astray, away from the path that would have best served the people. Russia has been disappointed by its leaders, time and time again. They always wanted the same thing: a Russia that was the overlord of Eurasia, tolerated no dissent and was feared by all the world.\n\nIt never worked. Fear always gave way to hate, dissent could never be silenced, and our neighbours never had cause to trust us. It's time to put away the dark dreams of Russia-that-was; time to embrace the future of freedom and peace that was denied her for so, so long."
 KOM_morozov_a_platform_for_unity_desc: "The foundation of a successful democracy is cooperation. While it might be nice to imagine everyone sharing our ideals, that isn't how people work. The diversity of race, creed, and class is mirrored in the diversity of thought within the minds of our citizens. The myopic approach of the Bolsheviks, assuming that everyone can be swayed to their 'perfect' ideology, must be dispensed with for the Republic to remain strong and free.\n\nTo demonstrate our good intentions, we shall enter into an alliance with one of the other major parties in the Assembly. Both command substantial support from the populace, and their support would strengthen our mandate. The question is: which? Which party will best suit our purposes: the rural, social-democratic elements of the PSD, or the labor-based democratic socialists of the DSNP?"
 KOM_morozov_the_violet_platform_desc: "Despite being marred by Voznesensky's legacy, the DSNP still commands the respect and support of urban working-class voters. Though more directly inclined towards socialism than ourselves, they are just as committed as we are to democracy. Working with them will show the urban working class that we are still dedicated to advancing the interests of the proletariat, even if our take on socialism isn't quite what they might like.\n\nInformally dubbed the 'Violet Platform', our alliance will be based on a promise to more actively pursue socialism. The more rightist elements of SMR will not be pleased, but they'll come around eventually. We are still ultimately socialists, after all; it makes sense for us to join with the party that shares our end goals, even if our means differ."
 KOM_morozov_for_the_worker_desc: "Hardline, anti-democratic socialists never understood what the working class really needed. All that talk of theory and uncompromising ideology... what good did it ever do the men and women who make a living on factory floors? A worker can't feed their family with populist ideals and workplace lectures!\n\nBoth SMR and the DSNP understand what the workers really want: a safe, productive work environment, one without harsh conditions or threats to life and limb. Better pay, better hours and better safety regulations will lead to healthier and more efficient workplaces. We will show the workers that one doesn't need to be a rabble-rousing demagogue to have their best interests at heart."
 KOM_morozov_the_sovereign_coalition_desc: "The PSD has little in common with SMR; while they are ardently anti-communist, we remain committed to socialism. They find support amongst the rural populace and conservatives, while we appeal to urbane and progressive voters. Nevertheless, they are more trustworthy than the perpetually corrupt DSNP, and desire a strong Russia as much as we do.\n\nWe can work with these 'sovereigntists'. Their policies of patriotism and Russian self-sufficiency might need to be tempered by cooler heads, but those aren't insurmountable obstacles. Some of their ideas have much to recommend about them; we will need a strong military to face Germany, and a certain measure of economic independence would protect us from negative economic developments around the world."
 KOM_morozov_for_the_people_desc: "Understandably, SMR is generally leery of the military. It has often served as fertile ground for radicalism of both left- and right-wing varieties. Involving armed men in politics never ends well. That said, the PSD is correct in its assessment that Russia needs a stronger military to defend itself.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation, we will show that we are willing to set aside our prejudices and experiment with the ideas of fellow democrats. Progressivism and pragmatism are not inherently in conflict with one another, and our technocratic ideas might find some appeal amongst high command. With the PSD's backing, we will begin a review into how we can improve the technological capabilities of the military and maintain its professional standards."
 KOM_morozov_a_show_of_cooperation_desc: "Even if it's not a formal coalition government, we have shown our commitment to democracy by cooperating with another political party. Some of our hardliners are yet to stop sulking and publicly give their blessing to this endeavour, but that doesn't matter. This exercise in goodwill has been a resounding success - none can question that fact.\n\nSome critics have derided both parties involved, dismissing the joint effort as a token gesture. They don't understand that democracy is more complicated than they make it out to be. There are always negotiations to undertake, compromises to be made. Yes, the fascists and communists might not have to worry about petty disagreements - but our freedom and happiness is more than worth that trifling cost."
 KOM_morozov_a_platform_for_reform_desc: "'Russia' and 'reform' are, sadly, two words that have never gone well together. Historically, reform has been hated both for going too far and for not going far enough. Foreigners have often observed that most Russians would rather indulge in murder than allow peaceful reform to occur under any circumstances.\n\nWe must agree somewhat. Reform is all about compromise and gradual change; it offends both ends of the political spectrum and provides a ready target for rabble-rousers. Nevertheless, we must press forth in line with our principles. The people have shown their maturity and commitment to reform by electing SMR - we must not disappoint them. Cultural and social reform are both on the table and ready to be presented to the Assembly."
 KOM_morozov_assist_the_republics_desc: "Neither the Empire nor the Bolsheviks ever showed much interest in improving the nation as a whole. For them, Russia only needed investment in a few key areas, usually whatever was relevant to the latest propagandized attempt to play catch-up with the West. The notion of wide-reaching progress was entirely lost on them.\n\nTo correct our course and become a truly modern state, we must take a more holistic approach to national wellbeing. We are not a top-down state ruling by decree, but a union of free and equal republics. None of our constituent republics, no matter their history or demographics, deserve to be left behind. So, the programs of modernization and urbanization employed in our heartlands will be shared with all our brother republics. The entire Russian family will be united in prosperity!"
 KOM_morozov_cultural_exhibits_desc: "Russia is home to more than just Russians. Dozens of ethno-cultural groups make up our great nation, though the Russian supremacist attitudes of past governments have diminished that fact in the world's eyes. Even many Russian Slavs, steeped in their own culture, refuse to accept the diversity of our nation.\n\nTo protect the heritage of our many peoples, President Morozov has proposed the establishment of the All-Russian Heritage Committee. Comprised of representatives from each republic, the ARHC will direct funding for museums, festivals, artwork commissions and so forth. When the world thinks 'Russian culture', they should think of more than just icons and domed churches."
 KOM_morozov_protect_natural_beauty_desc: "The Motherland has not been treated well by her children. The Tsars might have been incompetent in economic matters, but at least they were incapable of ruining the countryside. The Bolsheviks, obsessed with rapid industrialization and maximizing economic output, were a different story. The failures of Bukharin's initiatives litter the Russian landscape; open-faced mines carved into hillsides, forests of smokestacks spewing soot skyward, rivers clogged with industrial runoff...\n\nIt's a sad sight, and one that no progressive nation should tolerate. If such practices continue, how long will it be until all of Russia looks like Kaukasien? Proper protections should be established before we progress any further with our industrialization and urbanization programs. Though industrialists and state industries alike will balk at stifling of their expansion, it is a measure necessary for future generations to enjoy Russia as it should be."
 KOM_morozov_uplift_minority_rights_desc: "Russia's national character is unfortunately tainted by its tendency towards chauvinism and homogeneity. Minorities of all stripes have been mistreated for centuries; first by royalty, then by revolutionaries. It seems that without intervention, Russia is doomed to remain stuck in its backwards, hateful ways.\n\nWe can't get rid of racism overnight, but we can make some important first steps. First, and most importantly: racial discrimination and hate speech must be outlawed, so that everyone can live lives free of fear. Second: the autonomy of minority republics must be permanently enshrined in the constitution. That is the only way to guarantee that a chauvinist government will never again trample on the rights of minorities."
 KOM_morozov_the_march_of_progress_desc: "Progress has never been a popular idea in Russia. It has always been affiliated with the things that many people dislike: change, diversity, foreign influence. People fear what they don't understand - and the Russian people are particularly short on understanding.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. People can learn, change their ways, open their minds; but it cannot be forced upon them. That is what traditional socialists always failed to understand. Some measure of top-down change is necessary, but the transformation of society they sought could never be forced upon an unwilling populace. Perhaps it will take a century to achieve our ideal. Maybe more. But no matter what comes, no matter what future generations choose, we have done the right thing, and given hope to a generation born with none of it."
 KOM_morozov_the_russian_economy_desc: "There is nothing much to recommend about the Russian economy, such as it is. We have plenty of natural resources and a large population, but lack the means to take advantage of them. What little industry we inherited from the Soviets is variously outdated, run-down, or just plain broken. That's to say nothing of our complete lack of international trade, a staple of modern economics.\n\nThankfully, President Morozov is an old hand at this sort of thing and knows just the people to help draft a plan for the new economy. It won't be easy; even the fundamentals of our economy are lacking and many crucial sectors are non-existent. We're starting from nothing - but perhaps that will be for the best. Better to be free of old burdens entirely than bear their expenses."
 KOM_morozov_establish_the_economic_zones_desc: "The finer details of economic recovery are for aspiring entrepreneurs and workers to manage. Free enterprise will take care of the groundwork. The state's role, meanwhile, must be to direct development in the most efficient direction possible.\n\nTo that end, our territory will be divided up into economic zones: regions where the economy will be organized by the government along the necessary lines. This way, we can avoid situations where prime agricultural land is given over to industry, or areas rich in resources are allocated to farmers."
 KOM_morozov_the_contract_responsiblity_system_desc: "Every past Russian government has attempted to achieve agricultural efficiency, but none ever met with success. The feudal nature of the Empire meant that any proposed reform would have to wrangle the indolent, greedy landowners. The Bolsheviks, on the other hand, cared more about having an ideologically acceptable system than a fair or functioning one. This has made famine a recurring and severe threat to our people.\n\nThe 'Contract Responsibility System' will ensure a stable food supply and good income for rural populations by giving parcels of land to groups of farmers. This will minimize competition over land. Additionally, we will accept taxation in grain and subsidize their other crops."
 KOM_morozov_aid_for_the_farmers_desc: "The current generation of Russian farmers have been building up their livelihoods from nothing. Mechanization was never a priority for the Bolsheviks, and the short-lived war economy only made their situation worse. Most farmers still work the land in the same manner as countless generations of peasants did.\n\nTo feed a growing population, our agricultural capacity needs to catch up with the modern world. For that to happen, every farmer will need the tools and equipment to match his American or Japanese counterpart. Though some economics chafe at the thought, we will have to instate massive discounts to make this possible - not an easy solution, but a smart one in the long-term."
 KOM_morozov_open_the_republic_desc: "Russia is a land of bounty, but it doesn't have everything we need. More specifically: it doesn't have capital. Most of what little wealth exists is in the hands of governments, bar a few particularly miserly individuals. With our nation in the state it's in now, there is only one place for us to turn.\n\nForeign capital must flow into the country. With it will come knowledge, innovation and technology. All three will improve our economy with alacrity, given the disparity in development. It will be a long time before we can break through the glass ceiling and into the upper echelon of global economic powers, but catching up will suffice for now."
 KOM_morozov_the_developmental_industry_sector_desc: "Naturally, industrialization will be a priority for us. The great nations of the world moved on from agrarianism decades if not centuries ago. Attempts were made by past governments, but the scale of industry found in Germany or Britain was never replicated here.\n\nBy offering to establish production facilities catering to foreign markets, we can become a workshop of the world. Given the less developed state of Russia, goods can be produced here at low cost compared to, for example, the United States. Basic goods from Russia exported en masse might not be glamorous, but if it works, it works."
 KOM_morozov_exploit_southern_oil_reserves_desc: "Oil is the lifeblood of nations and the foundation of many economies. Our reserves might not be as vast as those of Venezuela or the Arab nations, but we have plenty to fuel our own economic growth. We have enough, in fact, that exports are a viable option. No doubt some nations will be grateful to have a source that isn't in the pocket of an existing superpower.\n\nReserves already exist in Samara, the Urals, and Tatarstan - a decent start, but we will need to drill deeper to find enough for a prospering oil industry. Expansion of existing facilities is a given; we can also look into more opportunities as we expand into Siberia. Just beyond our borders, there could be enough oil to make us a top competitor in the energy business!"
 KOM_morozov_comprehensive_refinement_program_desc: "Exporting crude oil is good business, but it could be better. Because it's refined overseas, we're missing out on a large portion of the profits from the finished product. It would be a lot more profitable to refine our oil here in Russia before exporting a usable product. We might sell a little less, but the overall profits will be much higher.\n\nWith those increased profits, we can follow the lead of the Arabs and begin massive investment programs to bring our nation into the modern era. It's a seller's market, and we're selling at very affordable prices. Black gold will succeed where real gold cannot, and with it we will buy our way to the future."
 KOM_morozov_foreign_investment_incentives_desc: "Some ardently patriotic types argue against it, but one cannot deny the efficacy of foreign investment. Granted, it tends to be the government rather than the citizens who benefit financially - but does that really matter right now? We should take any opportunity to further our economic growth, no matter whether it offends the ideologues and a few proud politicians.\n\nLabor incentives and tax breaks are all one usually needs to get foreign investors interested. We will offer both to corporations who open branch offices in Western Russia, as well as those who partner with Russian companies. It worked for the rest of the world; it can work for us, too!"
 KOM_morozov_project_kibersin_desc: "The field of computing has expanded dramatically in the past two decades. Our resident computer scientists were stunned to learn what kind of advances have been made by the great powers. There has even been some discussion of the possibility that computers will be used in virtually every profession in a few decades!\n\nPresident Morozov is most interested, and has gathered the Republic's small clique of computer scientists in the capital. Together, they have devised Project KiberSin: an astoundingly ambitious yet quite achievable plan to revolutionize the economy. This will involve establishing computer hubs, placed in key locations around the country. Able to process information at lightning speed, they will provide us with the most efficiently-managed economy in the world - at least, once we have the technology."
 KOM_morozov_managerial_socialism_desc: "Our free-market reforms and move away from the Bolsheviks should not be misinterpreted. The President is still, in his heart, a socialist. However, while we might aspire to socialist ideals, we are not blinded by ambition or ideological fanaticism. Socialism cannot be forced; it must be born naturally, coaxed gently into being with the consent of voters.\n\nTo this end, we have adopted the principle of 'Managerial Socialism'. Our economy will be regulated and structured in a manner that avoids the pitfalls of liberal capitalism while still enjoying its benefits. Eventually - so the thinking goes - it will progress into a state wherein a peaceful transition to true socialism will occur naturally, without the need for bloodshed and tyranny."
 KOM_morozov_for_our_prosperity_desc: "Poverty is the bane of all nations. As the wealth and wellbeing of the people diminishes, so too does their homeland. Russia could build cities of gleaming spires, establish a space program and become the world's largest nuclear power. Yet, none of those things would elevate the poor from the gutter and give them the happiness they deserve.\n\nWe shall attack poverty directly and decisively, the better to end its tyranny. This is not a battle that can be won overnight, but future victory can be secured right now. What keeps people in poverty is the need to live on a knife's edge; that can be allayed with a proper safety net. When the poor no longer need to worry about affording their next meal or keeping a roof over their heads, they can become productive citizens and help lift themselves out of deprivation and despair."
 KOM_morozov_an_educated_populace_desc: "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers, and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 KOM_morozov_standardize_the_schools_desc: "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 KOM_morozov_unity_in_science_desc: "Science is the way to the future, but our progress in that direction has been halted. The rest of the world has moved on, while we, the Russians, are still working with textbooks from the early Soviet era. This problem is easily remedied, but how to get ordinary people invested in this 'boring' subject?\n\nWhy, propaganda! Propaganda is a dirty word these days, but how else can a government effectively convey its ideals and intentions? It doesn't have to mean brainwashing and 24-hour broadcasts; we can campaign for science through TV, radio and newspapers as we would if we were recruiting for the military. The lessons learned from stoking patriotic pride can be applied well in the popularization of science."
 KOM_morozov_a_bright_generation_desc: "President Morozov is said by some to desire nothing more or less than to be at the head of a grand bureaucratic machine. They say that he cares only for the sense of satisfaction he feels at knowing his grand design is functioning smoothly. They are wrong.\n\nThe greatest and noblest of the President's desires is to leave Russia in a better state than he found it. The best way to ensure that happens is to give all of Russia's children the twin gifts of education and safety. In time, it will fall to them to continue what we have started.

 KOM_coups.1.t: "Leftist Attacks Reported!"
 KOM_coups.1.d: "At first, there were only scattered reports. Right-wing paramilitary leaders attacked in their homes. Businesses broken into in the dead of night, their inventories seized in \"proletarian expropriations\". Mass spontaneous rallies against the police, with officers temporarily pushed out of entire neighborhoods. As more and more incidents rock Syktyvkar, the communist threat is becoming increasingly clear. There has been an undeniable upward trend in leftist violence in recent days; we have a crisis on our hands.\n\nThe communists have always been a major element in Syktyvkar's street politics, but the political turmoil of the past few weeks has given them an opportunity to drastically expand their operations. In the face of democratic failures, their support has grown and radicalized. A sizable amount of the leftist fringe has been violent in the past, but the audacity of these new attacks on Komi's elite and government is unprecedented. As they might say, we are rapidly approaching a \"revolutionary situation\".\n\nWhile their challenges to our authority are disturbing, the communists have not made overt threats to the Presidium as of yet. Vigilance is necessary, but we must be careful not to overstep our bounds, lest we give the left an excuse to escalate tensions to the breaking point."
 KOM_coups.1.a: "Keep an eye on the reds..."
 KOM_coups.2.t: "Leftists Attack Police Station!"
 KOM_coups.2.d: "Residents of central Syktykvar were rudely awakened last night by the sounds of yelling and breaking glass, as members of a left-wing paramilitary waged an all-out attack on a local police station. According to witness reports, the incident occurred shortly after midnight. Somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five masked youths armed with bricks and batons stormed the station, breaking windows and assaulting the outnumbered officers. Two officers were hospitalized, but the attackers ignored non-police personnel. Owing to the time, the station was significantly understaffed; investigators believe the operation was meticulously planned to maximize chances of success.\n\nThe instigators successfully fled the scene, but two were recognized by neighbors and subsequently brought into custody. The police have identified them as Anatoly S. and Bogdan P., members of the Workers' Street Battalions, a local ultra-left paramilitary loosely connected to the Communist Party. Both have refused to assist officers with the investigation. Judging by the coordinated nature of the operation and its members' discipline, the possibility exists that this attack was ordered by Party higher-ups as a show of force, rather than being an impulsive move by radical 'lone wolves'."
 KOM_coups.2.a: "Officer down!"
 KOM_coups.3.t: "Sabotage on the Roads!"
 KOM_coups.3.d: "Driving in Syktyvkar, with its poorly kept roads and tendency towards street violence, has never been easy. Cars tend to be reserved for businessmen and politicians, people who value privacy, speed, and security in their travels and have the money or connections to get the best possible transport. This makes road travel prestigious -as well as a target for those who seek to destabilize the Republic.\n\nThree days ago, a simultaneous detonation of several explosive devices on roads and bridges in central Syktyvkar paralyzed the city for several hours, as first responders were unable to reach the scene. Despite the devastation caused by these bombings, the perpetrators appear to have attempted to minimize casualties; the explosions occurred in the middle of the night, and the primary targets were the roads surrounding the Presidium building and several prominent local businesses. However, they still claimed two lives, and five other people have been hospitalized. The bombers are currently unidentified and remain at large, but the targeting of local elites suggests that they belonged to radical leftist movements.\n\nThis is a sobering day for the Republic. The bombings took Syktyvkar's already beleagured police force completely by surprise. Justice becomes less likely with each passing hour, while the militant Communists become ever more organized."
 KOM_coups.3.a: "The road to chaos..."
 KOM_coups.4.t: "Fascist Attack on the Government!"
 KOM_coups.4.d: "As if the attacks from the left were bad enough, the government is now facing serious challenges from the other direction. Right-wing violence has often taken the backseat to communist militancy in the eyes of Komi's state and police forces, especially with the preponderance of left-wing terrorist attacks in the past several weeks. As they are finding out all too late, Komi's establishment have seriously underestimated the threat the right poses to the government.\n\nRadical right-wing Passionarists shelled the Presidium and its immediate surroundings with mortar rounds during a press conference, killing several journalists. By sheer chance, the blasts failed to kill any politicians, although two Communist Party legislators received light injuries. Right wing parties were not present at the events. Lev Gumilyov informed reporters that the Passionarists were having a meeting at the time, although he failed to elaborate on the reason for convening or the topics covered. Several Passionarist politicians, declining to provide evidence, allege that the attack was a false flag by police or radical leftists and completely deny complicity.\n\nWhile the journalists' families are left to mourn their dead, the government must confront the fact that it is under full assault from not one but two extremist factions. Syktyvkar's experts have little faith that the government, already struggling to contain the communists, can quickly devote adequate resources to this new crisis, but the past few weeks have shown one thing for certain: there is always a way that the situation can get worse."
 KOM_coups.4.a: "The jackboot, poised to stomp on Komi."
 KOM_coups.5.t: "Reports of Widespread Looting!"
 KOM_coups.5.d: "The breakdown of Komi's political system is now accompanied by the shattering of order on the streets. As paramilitaries rage and the police desperately try to restore stability to the city, less scrupulous citizens have resorted to simply stealing what they need from shops and businesses.\n\nSome of these new brigands are political radicals, forcibly expropriating goods from what they see as either bourgeois thieves or plotters against the nation. Others are desperate members of Syktyvkar's poor, simply trying to survive in the midst of this turmoil. Most are somewhere in between, disaffected citizens who have lost faith in the democratic government to give them the basic necessities of life. The sheer magnitude of these lootings, their spontaneity, and their low priority given the abundance of more severe dangers to the Republic have disincentivized a serious police response, making it unlikely that many of the thousands of perpetrators will face justice in the near future.\n\nWhile not a direct political challenge to the state's security, these lootings symbolize the grave fact that many of Komi's denizens no longer respect law and order. Only time can tell whether the police's absence on the streets is a temporary case or a permanent surrender of authority, but things do not look good for the Republic."
 KOM_coups.5.a: "This can't be good for business."
 KOM_coups.6.t: "Rightists Seize Arms Stockpile!"
 KOM_coups.6.d: "The far right has never been shy to go into combat. What can only be described as a sick glorification of violence and martyrdom impels fascists and other such groups to charge suicidally at far stronger foes, even when moderation would be a smarter tactic. Sometimes, audacity pays off, as superior forces occupied by seemingly more important matters overlook a hidden threat until too late.\n\nA monarchist offshoot group sent shivers down the spines of Komi's citizens and police force recently when it seized a fortified arsenal in central Syktyvkar and made off with a great quantity of firearms and explosives. Despite being outnumbered significantly by the police, the right-wingers' ferocity and their use of ambush tactics made the attack a massacre. Ten police officers were killed, with at least twice as many wounded, with only a single assailant killed in response.\n\nNow even more heavily armed, Komi's right-wing will likely continue its bloody quasi-insurgency against the state. These days, it seems as though the government is but a sheep surrounded by slavering wolves, with no way to escape or punish these vicious enemies."
 KOM_coups.6.a: "Is Komi doomed to have its throat torn out?"
 KOM_coups.7.t: "Protests Against the Government!"
 KOM_coups.7.d: "Komi's population has never been content to bottle up its discontent in silence. Rallies, strikes, and mass gatherings are a common sight on the streets of Syktyvkar. There are many in the city who feel as though the Republic's leaders have failed them, and in this political moment that number has steadily grown.\n\nProtests that once numbered in the hundreds now number in the thousands. A blistering array of demonstrations, some planned by a community or labor organization and some completely spontaneous, have paralyzed the central city, as citizens demand higher pay, better conditions, police protection, and other vague yet intense demands. Most are relatively peaceful, but some have broken out into full-fledged violence, overwhelming the thinly stretched ranks of the police.\n\nPoliticians, relatively isolated from the chaos consuming the streets, are starting to feel the pressure. Komi's already very serious problem with radicals will likely only worsen, as a greater quantity of people becomes convinced that violence is the only way to alter the system. Among the nervous ranks of the elite, one thought predominates: if this continues, the Republic's very future may be at risk."
 KOM_coups.7.a: "How much more can the people take?"
 KOM_coups.8.t: "Public Discontent Rises!"
 KOM_coups.8.d: "What are the law, justice, or government other than products of a mass popular consensus? All it takes to destroy even those institutions that seem immense and all-encompassing is a gradual loss of people's faith in them. Komi's institutions are new and brittle, and in the face of a crisis of legitimacy they are starting to shatter.\n\nThe public attitude towards authority has changed noticeably for the worse, much to the chagrin of Komi's police and elected officials. Neighborhoods have walled themselves off, driving away officers and relying on each other (and sometimes radical paramilitaries) for security. The message is clear: the people no longer trust the government to help them.\n\nIf Komi's government is to survive in its current form, it needs to reaffirm to the populace that it is able to protect them. As the slow collapse of police authority in much of Syktyvkar confirms, the Republic is a long way off from earning back the public's trust."
 KOM_coups.8.a: "We must maintain their confidence!"
 KOM_coups.9.t: "Paramilitaries Ambushed!"
 KOM_coups.9.d: "Komi's myriad feuding political organizations have often come to blows. Bloody noses and broken bones are a common sight after weekend street rights between the competing paramilitaries of the far left and far right. These clashes are rarely lethal, which makes the recent murder of several paramilitary commanders all the more shocking.\n\nUsing military-grade weaponry, a leftist radical has assassinated three lieutenants of a street fighting group associated with our government's forces. The boldness of this assault is unprecedented; the victims were ambushed outside of a local restaurant, where they had been having lunch, scarcely past noon. The attacker threw a grenade at the establishment before gunning the men down with a machine pistol. He was himself killed in a shootout with their bodyguards shortly afterwards. Officers were able to find his identity, that of one Vasily K., and determine his political affiliations through his possessions, which included The Communist Manifesto, but he has no clear connections to the Communist Party or local leftist groups. This suggests either that he was a lone wolf or that he was very good at covering his tracks.\n\nReports are already coming in of escalating tensions between active militias, as both sides prepare for the possibility of revenge killings and a spiral of violence. The situation on the streets is becoming ever tenser, and law enforcement seems powerless to stop the killings."
 KOM_coups.9.a: "The Red Menace grows ever stronger..."
 KOM_coups.10.t: "Church Burnt to the Ground!"
 KOM_coups.10.d: "Any person with even a grain of political literacy is aware that the far left has always had a tense relationship with organized religion. Komi's communists have been vocal in their displeasure at Christianity, especially as churches became bolder in their activity with the withdrawal of the WRRF from Syktyvkar. In past days, this mostly took the form of angry rallies outside religious institutions, but normality seems to have ascended to a higher plane since the beginning of our political turmoil.\n\nA church associated with Syktyvkar's conservative monarchists has recently been burned to the ground in what appears to be the most flagrant arson attack in several years. Fortunately, it was empty, the blaze having struck roughly two hours after the end of Sunday services. Officers were initially unable to find a perpetrator or motive, until the presumed arsonist mailed a letter to the police station filled with anti-religious invective and sections from The Communist Manifesto. Rumors about the arsonist and their potential future targets have spread like wildfire throughout Syktyvkar's religious community, and several prominent churches have employed police or militia guards.\n\nEven in Komi's perpetually agitated political climates, churches have largely remained safe from direct assault. The fact that previously untouchable targets have fallen under attack is a testament to the undeniable decline of political order and state power. The only thing that can be done now is pray that the situation won't degrade to an even greater degree."
 KOM_coups.10.a: "Is nothing sacred anymore?"
 KOM_coups.11.t: "Communist Attack on the Government!"
 KOM_coups.11.d: "Despite the breakdown in order on the streets of Syktyvkar, many politicians believed government buildings would be spared. The Presidium would simply be too risky of a target, and, no matter how swamped with cases, the police force would be tireless in pursuing any would-be assailant. It is clear now that they were tragically mistaken.\n\nThe clock was scarcely past ten last morning when the sound of mortar shells hitting the Presidium building badly rattled Syktyvkar's residents. Communist militiamen posted on a nearby building had timed the attack precisely to when as many moderate and conservative politicians as possible were inside the building. Thankfully, there were no deaths; security was well prepared and the evacuation went smoothly. The vast majority of the Communist Party was curiously absent at the time, although its leadership has completely denied knowledge of the events and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation. Many in the police are skeptical, but the crisis-level criminal situation has made them completely unable to coordinate a serious inquiry. Communist presence in many of Komi's neighborhoods has reached the point where they can credibly challenge the police, and few are eager to see what would happen if they clashed openly.\n\nThis attack has completely shattered the illusion that Komi's politicians are insulated from the upswing in political violence. The only question now is whether the politics of the street will inevitably overpower the politics of the state, or if Komi's government still has a leg to stand upon."
 KOM_coups.11.a: "Code Red!"
 KOM_coups.12.t: "Anti-Government Riots in Syktyvkar!"
 KOM_coups.12.d: "The Capital of the Komi Republic: shiny, stinking. A rotten salmon in the moonlight. Cool air flows through buildings like hands through unkempt dollar-bills, into public spaces dripping neon-white confusion on street signs and protest slogans. Crowds melt and ebb and gather, viscous, ephemeral: the new youth hang on street corners, their tongues echoing all variants of political thought. Tense times. Tense city. Komi fears.\n\nTonight: hooded gazes, coming in packs, like hyenas stalking prey. Everyone sees the storm, the hail-like rain falling in the distance. They come anyway. Wordless is their engine - heart-stirrings from the crushing and cracking city. Komi is a machine, endless vistas of flesh, working like gears. They are spanners. Their time has come.\n\nPolice guards, eyes held like pistols, steady, unyielding, quietly lethal. Barriers, flesh and plywood, holding back the street. Whispers turn to talk, then to yells. Thuds echo - not thunder. Wood on flesh, unmistakable. Points, screams, then all at once, as an orchestra slamming into a new note, a sea breaking on undiscovered tides -\n\nAction.\n\nOne, two, three shots, and the crowd overwhelms the pistoleer. As its sound fades, new ones replace it. Windows shatter like chandeliers, falling from the sky's ceiling. Here and there, trashcans lit aflame, left to roll around. New jesters for a court turned upside down. The Government. The businessmen. The army. The Jews. Suddenly all are enemies, and all must be brought to trial. Syktyvkar is a court, a trial run for the people's justice, and its citizens are vengeful judiciaries.\n\nNothing happens; rather, everything happens unseen. Street-sweepers arrive to clear the flaming wreckage. Dirt-smeared signs are cleared by noon. Everyone, of course, says nothing."
 KOM_coups.12.a: "This will not be the last. We know this."
 KOM_coups.13.t: "General Strike Declared!"
 KOM_coups.13.d: "Valentina fiddled with his pens, as he usually did at times of strife like these. There were many, gathered from all the four corners of Russia by collectors and tradesmen, and their nibs ranged from the thick and stylistic to the thinnest of thin. It was a forgotten art, and he was a middling collector. A quiet pride for the old factory worker - something to do with his free time, something the Government couldn't take away.\n\nToday, however, he had different goals in mind. He chose one of his largest nibs, almost the size of a vegetable stalk, and grabbed a red inkwell from his study. There was work to be done, heralded by the ring of the doorbell. He raised his hands out the window, clapping twice - \"no surveillance agents nearby\" - and closed the windowsill. Comrade Pushkov would not tolerate lateness.\n\nPushkov had brought the little scamp Iosef with him, out of pity or some misguided sense of duty Valentina could not say. Sighing, Valentina ruffled the little boy's hair, told him not to touch anything in the attic, and got to work on the massive canvas laid out in the living room. Touch upon touch the letters rose in brilliant Cyrillic font - WORKERS RISE UP! OPPRESSION MUST END, OR THE STRIKE WILL NOT! - and with them the little flourishes Valentina had practiced: hammers, sickles and stars seemed to take flight upon the carefully woven synthetic paper.\n\nAs the canvas seemed to fill with color and energy, Pushkov nodded. It was time to bring the little artwork into the open. Iosef skipped with excitement as they neared the crowds near the old factory, a furious mass of masked workers and angry signs. Valentina gestured rudely, and Iosef, nodding, took the banner's edge and unfurled it into the air. The banner took flight, joining the hundreds already in the air, and yells of exuberance arose from the heightened crowd. Smiling, Valentina joined in.\n\nThousands more would join the procession, and protests like it across Syktyvkar, as the industry of Komi ground to a halt. The workers' tide rose, a wave of garish red, and the government stood helpless to stop it."
 KOM_coups.13.a: "This is foolishness! Get back to work, all of you!"
 KOM_coups.14.t: "Republican Bandits Raid City Outskirts!"
 KOM_coups.14.d: "We've been receiving scattered, but consistent reports all morning about a raid upon the outskirts of the city of Syktyvkar by an army of Republican holdouts!\n\nTruthfully, 'army' is being quite generous. We're being attacked by men with makeshift weapons and small arms.\n\nNo one we've interviewed has been able to give us a straight answer on what they're after, but witnesses report that they were focusing more on our defences than upon the populace, additionally, a few were spotted scribbling in notebooks, suggesting that this might be the probing force before a much larger operation."
 KOM_coups.14.a: "Fortify everything!"
 KOM_coups.15.t: "Conflict in the Police!"
 KOM_coups.15.d: "Our regime has many opponents, and these opponents have managed to organize the civilian population of Komi into misguided protests. These protests have steadily escalated against our regime, and with the appearance of armed individuals within these crowds, it is clear that our government's survival is at stake. Therefore, our government has decided to send in the police, and forcefully disperse the protestors. It may become a scandal, but the lives of a few dissidents is a price we are willing to pay for stability.\n\nOur police arrived on the scene, armed and ready to disperse the protestors. When it became clear that they would not stand down, they were given the order to open fire. Except, when the protestors called for the police to 'march with us,' that is exactly what some did. A large portion of the police sent to disperse the protestors refused to fire, citing the protestors as 'non threatening.' Clearly these policemen need to be dismissed, as their loyalties are not with their government, as they should be.\n\nThe larger problem is the fact that the protests continue, and only grow in size. As they grow, our government can't help but notice that more and more weapons are appearing amongs the crowds. We need a new plan, since we clearly can't rely on law enforcement."
 KOM_coups.15.a: "Who are they supposed to serve?!"
 KOM_coups.16.t: "Shots Fired Near Internatsionalnaya Street!"
 KOM_coups.16.d: "Despite the fall of their government, the Republican Army has refused to surrender. Now resistance cells dot the countryside, engaging in guerilla campaigns against our government and our forces. They aren't a direct threat to our government, but they are keeping us from securing our hold over Komi, and it is clear that we should have been more thorough during our coup. The most recent news to reach our government only helps to confirm such a perspective.\n\nApparently, one of our Army patrols travelling between cities has been attacked. The culprits were Republican Army holdouts, who had set up an ambush on Internatsionalnaya Street. The encounter was brief, but bloody, and our forces took multiple casualties. They were forced to return to Syktyvkar, and apparently our soldiers failed to eliminate the rebels that attacked them. We need to send a more prepared force to snuff out this holdout, and we will need to discuss the Republican problem further."
 KOM_coups.16.a: "They may be a nuisance, but they are not a threat."
 KOM_coups.17.t: "Rightists Seize Community House!"
 KOM_coups.17.d: "Komi's far-right may not speak directly of the need for Lebensraum, but it clearly feels as though the seizure of more territory is an imperative for its survival. As the Republic teeters on its foundations, fascist groups have extended their reach throughout the city of Syktyvkar, carving out a safe haven for their brand of violent activism.\n\nIn another worrying showcase of how little the law seems to matter to some of Syktyvkar's less savory residents, far-right groups associated with Sergey Taboritsky's monarchist movement occupied a government owned public housing block, ejecting members of the community and seemingly converting the establishment into a fascist stronghold. Armed paramilitaries stand guard around the clock, leaving the police seemingly powerless to take the building back for the citizenry. One can only guess what is taking place behind those walls, but the streams of rightists moving in and out of them suggests that the center is being used for training, coordination, propaganda operations, or other such activities.\n\nIt is always worrying to see the far-right gain ground, but such aggressive moves suggest that the fascists are preparing for crises yet to come. The state cannot afford to ignore them for even a moment."
 KOM_coups.17.a: "Not very neighborly of them, to say the least."
 KOM_coups.18.t: "Fascists Seize Arms Stockpile!"
 KOM_coups.18.d: "As the weeks go by, Komi's fragile order seems on its deathbed, and the vultures are circling only closer overhead. The far-right and far-left's attacks on democracy have only increased in severity and frequency, and without clear leadership or the ability to preserve order the state is unable to mount an effective response. The extremists smell blood in the water, and they will ruthlessly tear Komi apart to install their agendas.\n\nThe far-right's adventurism has only escalated, as they use the spoils of earlier raids to go after bigger targets. A recent attack on a weapons storage facility led to the Passionarist perpetrators making out like bandits, humiliating the police in the process. The pitched battle killed more fascists than officers, but they still got their prize: a cache of military-grade equipment that could easily be put to use performing more mayhem in the streets.\n\nAs losses continue to roll in for the police, many of Syktyvkar's residents are beginning to wonder whether they can rely on anyone, other than themselves, to protect them."
 KOM_coups.18.a: "Do the fascists have any humanity at all?"
 KOM_coups.19.t: "Fascist Sabotage Attempt!"
 KOM_coups.19.d: "As Komi's populace has had to learn quickly, no one is safe from political violence. The police and the politicians are the greatest targets, but ordinary people can find themselves the victims of terror and madness without any notice. The fascists are particularly culpable in this atmosphere of dread, since they target civilians indiscriminately in their mad attempts to purify the city.\n\nCitizens on their morning commute were very nearly the latest victims of right-wing violence, as unidentified members of the Passionarist movement planted a bomb on a local streetcar. Only luck prevented shrapnel from ripping through over twenty people; the device, an improvised explosive made from spare parts, failed to detonate. The police are hard at work searching for the culprits, but the remote nature of the operation makes finding them unlikely.\n\nTo say the police caught an enormous break would be an understatement. If things had gone only slightly differently, there would be an enormous scandal on the government's hands. The far-right will surely not stop its terror attacks after this defeat, and all the Republic can do is hope that its good fortune does not run out."
 KOM_coups.19.a: "An incredible stroke of luck. One that cannot be relied upon again."

 KOM_coups.20.d: "Excerpt from Internal Security Bureau, Kotlas Working Group Report To Central Committee, XX-XX-19XX\n\n...causes for the present uptick in virulent sentiments towards the Republic are unknown, although some fairly quick ideas can be surmised. There is the matter of our recent occupation, which has been neither gentle nor accepted in the eyes of the occupied, and there is also the matter of our perceived political weakness. Needless to say, our checkered history has not brought any confidence to the masses here; the other day one of our members overheard the re-enactment of a recent coup-attempt in the streets, complete with bawdy and inappropriate rhetoric towards our nation's leadership.\n\nWe have also attached photos of recent demonstrations; as you have most likely already heard, the latest series of protests involved effigies of senior government figures. Efforts to trace the ringleaders of these demonstrations have proved futile, but in truth many of the activities performed in these photos are likely to be spontaneous: after all, it does not take a political provocateur to light a petrol-soaked doll on fire. The rampant violence in the wake of these protests on civilian governance institutions, however, are believed to have been pre-organized, and our garrison has been ordered to secure the culprits and make their punishment public...\n\nSummary: Situation in Kotlas slowly worsening - occupation policy main cause. Strategic options limited, perhaps non-existent, given present circumstances."
 KOM_coups.20.a: "Can't the police do something?!"
 KOM_coups.21.t: "Reactionaries Assail Communist Headquarters!"
 KOM_coups.21.d: "It is hard even to name the disparate groups that are gathered to the fascist movements of Komi, so scattered are their organizations: even so, it is hard to argue with numbers, the most certain metric of threat. By this metric the crowd that has gathered around the Communist Party Headquarters of Syktyvkar have become more than a mere threat: they have become an organized danger to the Headquarters' occupants.\n\nYelling the names of Gumilyov and Shafarevich, the mob holds aloft posters declaring their unabashed love for Passionariyy and their equal hatred of the State. Agitators shouting into microphones only amplify the chaos as they fan the flames of a thousand hatreds. Rage at the Government's latest policy maneuvers, the nationalisation of industries, and the abhorrent Marxist filth that has gotten into the public education system coalesces into a single turbid mass of discontent with the status quo. As the sun sets to the west, the crowd only grows in numbers and in fury - Party members attempting to reason with them are forced back and spat upon.\n\nA febrile brew of hatred, waiting for a spark - and with a single gunshot the whole edifice is set alight.\n\nNo one knows who fires the shot, or if the Government, or Passionariyy remnants, or outside agitators, is behind the escalation. In a sense, it is immaterial - the enraged mob reacts precisely the way one would expect an enraged mob to behave. Residents throw themselves against the walls, attempting to crawl up, and several are injured by barbed wire before the crowd succeeds in pushing a barricade aside.\n\nThe doors are locked, and the doors long since barricaded (standard Party policy), but one inventive protestor manages a parting shot. A Zhdanov cocktail is thrown through the windows, and the conflagration consumes a room of documents before it is put out in the morning."

 KOM_coups.22.d: "Increased reports have been filtered through local police departments of brutal thuggish attacks by groups of armed men on minority citizens. Rightist bandits, in their filthy radical pleasures, are reported to gang-up on vulnerable jews and other ethnic minorities in back alleys and darkened streets, beating them senseless. Indeed, their presence is known even by passers-by who recognise them as villains.\n\nThey cause a general chaos in our Republic, and although these events are limited and victims often survive, they are becoming more frequent and more deadly in nature. In fact, the attacks are telling of the bigotry that has plunged so deep into the hearts of Russia's criminals; a reflection of the vile and cruel state our once great nation has sunk into."

 KOM_coups.23.d: "Marching in the eastern frontiers of our Republic, the Red Army's steps crunched in the snow. Their strides were orderly, making their way to the nearest village from an encampment. Our men were tired and bitter from the cold, the only thing keeping them going was the thought of food and warmth as they approached civilization.\n\nSuddenly a piercing ring shot through the valley and our men were fired upon from battlements hidden in the wilderness' icy hills. The zip and crackle of gunfire caught many soldiers off-guard and sliced through their limbs; some of our men were chewed up completely by the opening spray of machine-gun fire. Fortunately, however, our men regrouped and engaged in this defensive skirmish with the invisible enemy, and eventually pushed on the offensive.\n\nBandit gunmen, it seemed, had surprised our brave soldiers in the hopes of stealing arms and munitions to supply their own pathetic caches scattered across the wintry forests of northern Russia. Their dead had been identified as rightist paramilitary forces; insurgents who had taken up arms in a feeble resistance against the communist government. Their 'noble' resistance took the form of these pitiful clashes, only resulting in violence and misery. Once the skirmish was over and blood had spilled red into the winter's snow, the Red Army men counted the lifeless bodies in the snow - now aware of political violence proliferating in our frontiers."

Due to the internal nature of this, no one realized that the trucks were broken until a soldier tried to start them this morning. After panicking, the soldiers realized that every truck in the fleet was sabotaged.\n\nAs this is where a solid amount of our trucks are located, this deals a heavy blow to our ability to move around troops. While an investigation has started to figure out who did this, it will certainly be difficult to find any evidence, as it seems likely that this sabotage occurred at least a few days ago."

If you think about it, they do most of the actual, practical work, and are the ones who manage and run much of the smaller parts of the country, like gears in a large machine. However, deep down, they are all workers. Workers who must be awarded by the socialist system that works for their benefit. Thus, we need to show them how beneficial the new state can be. If we make them promises of increased pay, better work conditions, and everything else we stride for, then surely they will show their support for our side, and stabilizing our control will be much easier.\"\n\nInitially, many of Ponomaryov's allies were skeptical about the idea, as in their minds the bureaucracy was a remnant of the bourgeoisie that had to go away with it. However, it was an intriguing option to secure their rule. With some more convincing, the project was given the green light."

With most organizations and institutions throughout Komi under the influence of the government, we can use them to further our goals and expand our influence. Additionally, we have secured the support of another fraction of the population by delivering on our original promises to help the working people of the country.

Finding a deal that satisfies both sides has been incredibly difficult, and things were only further complicated yesterday, when the bureaucrats simply walked out of the negotiations, and refuse to cooperate with the authorities.\n\nNow, chaos and confusion dominates Syktyvkar and all levels of government in the country, as no one is quite sure what to do. We are desperately trying to salvage the situation as best as we can, but any success is unlikely. At the same time, many high-profile office-holders have resigned from their positions in reaction to these recent developments, and others are simply ignoring our authority.

 KOM_left_coups.9.d: "The capital of Komi was in complete lockdown ever since the first tanks left their positions to take control of the city in the name of the Left. No one could get in, and no one could get out. It was that simple, but the arrival of a small wave of refugees would complicate the situation. It was not just one large caravan, but many different ones, each coming from elsewhere. Some were coming from the north, some from the south, and some from Moskowien. Initially, they met the loyal garrisons of the Left, situated in the periphery of Syktyvkar to guard it from any possible incursions or threats. Of course, being in the middle of a coup, they were denied access. But some have resorted to more extreme means.\n\nWith only the key points around the city guarded, there have been \"holes\" in the security of the lockdown, and the refugees have used this to their advantage. Sneaking under forest cover or jumping over fences and barriers, many have entered the capital, desperately seeking to find shelter. The military does not seem to have this under control.

Several reports from the city outskirts have shown that, in the end, these were not innocent civilians. Apparently, many of them are affiliated with Centrist and Rightist paramilitaries and insurgency groups, and have begun to aid them in the effort to overthrow the recently established socialist government.\n\nWe had believed that our forces had managed to secure the capital, by defeating the vast majority of the enemy troops in battle or disarming them. However, some holdouts continue their operations, and these refugees have immediately moved to help them in their mission. This has evolved into a major crisis, as we are currently in risk of completely losing control to the resurging militias. The socialist government is considering the options it has right now."

Of course, not one of them was loyal to the Center or the Right.\n\nThe speech, ignoring the socialist rhetoric and vague promises for progress and reform made, focused on one thing: all loyal units, regular and irregular, would be united under one command, and create the Red Army of the Komi Republic. Closely modelled after all such formations in the history of communist nations, its purpose would be to defend the Republic from any threats that appear, internal or external. At the end of his speech, Ponomaryov received thundering applause, and was cheered by all his allies.\n\nHowever, despite the idealistic remarks made by the General Secretary, the Red Army's goal right now is one, and it is simple: restore order to this chaotic state and ensure the proper establishment of the new regime. The question now is who to focus on eliminating first from the two major movements operating in Komi: the democratic Center, or the Passionariyy right?"

Though much of our messages to the public are loud and threatening, it is necessary to instill courage and toughness into anyone willing to take up a rifle.\n\nUnfortunately, the broadcast of such propaganda may also deter citizens from their faith in the Communist system.

They may rat him out for being too much of an idealist, with no realism to back his cause.\n\nWhat hangs in the balance is the decision: should he eliminate these \"allies\" now, nipping the problem in the bud, or should he let them live and keep his support within the party?"

Furthermore, it was clear that she needed to stabilize quickly, or else she'd likely be overthrown by some other faction. The Republic itself had a fair amount of resources, and proper application of said resources would probably be enough to stabilize Komi, given time. Time that she may not have.\n\nBukharina paused her musings and drank from her cup of tea. It was sweet, but not sweet enough, leaving a bitter aftertaste in her mouth. Of course, she did not have to stand alone against her enemies. There was always the option of allying herself with major figures in the Party like Suslov or his rivals. Their extralegal help would alleviate a lot of the strain from stabilization, and it would allow her to focus more resources on other necessary functions. Of course, there was the obvious consequence that whoever she accepted aid from would gain influence in the party, which could prove dangerous. Was it worth obtaining aid if it'd lead to her being stabbed in the back later on? Would her not leaning on the Party for help lead to her government being overthrown by someone else? Neither option was completely ideal, but hopefully she'd be able to handle the consequences of either one."

While he supposed it was natural for him to be nervous, seeing as how Bukharina herself assigned them this mission, it wouldn't be good to be openly anxious. Dimitri took a deep breath.\n\n\"Alright comrades, Bukharina herself has assigned us to conduct a raid. I'm sure you've all heard that one anti-communist radio station at some point, the one with the hosts who drink a lot?\" Dimitri looked around, seeing nods from everyone present. \"Good. It's my job to conduct a raid on that radio station and end its blaring of propaganda. Now, seeing as the situation in Komi is not exactly the most stable, we can't afford to quickly muster up troops, as such a diversion could lead to a counter-coup. Of course, if we take a long time slowly pulling troops, the Republican Guard could catch wind of it.\" Dimitri paused, but was left unable to continue as another officer interjected with his own idea, spiralling into an hour long discussion. At the end of the discussion, Dimitri was left with a choice: devote a fair amount of resources to the raid, or deeply plan it out, allowing for more forces to be mustered?"

Bukharina smiled at him.\n\n\"It is slightly disappointing that the operator got away, but I'm happy you and your men were able to end their slanderous broadcasts without issue. Is your report finished?\" Bukharina asked. Dimitri nodded. \"Good. You're free to go. Enjoy the rest of your day.\"\n\nDimitri left Bukharina's office, happy.

She looked at the messenger, taking a deep breath and unclenching her fist.\n\n\"Please leave, you can finish later,\" Bukharina said. The messenger left. Bukharina slammed her hand on her desk, ignoring the pain. She'd known that the fascists were absolute scum, but to steal supplies meant for innocents? Did they have no sense of care for the people at all? Civilian casualties may be acceptable losses for the fascists, but they weren't to Bukharina. She'd have to try to pull supplies from somewhere else, or counter-raid the fascist caches to make up the loss. It would be hard, but she could do it. After all, she'd come this far, right?"

The potential of the worker, of Russia, is boundless, and what keeps us apart is not only petty grievances but our insistence on repeating the same mistakes.\n\nSimply put, this cycle of repetition and damnation is something that cannot stand, if we wish to guide Russia to a glorious future.\n\nAs it stands, you're at a crossroad, which is why this letter comes to you. Right now, Suslov and his pawns plan behind closed curtains, to tread Komi back to the same failing tune that led us to disgrace, and he and his yolk must be stamped into nothing but the annals of the shameful past of Russia.

Of course, that also means many amongst them aren't really truthful to his ideology, but simply desiring to save their own skin; opportunistics will be dealt with time, once their biggest, common threat is done with.

He would always come home to a hearty meal, and a clean house.\n\nWhich made his disappearance, in her mind quite odd.\n\nAs she stared at the wooden seat, the steaming bowl of radish soup sitting in front of her, she pondered what could be so important happening right now. Syktyvkar has always been turbulent, but he always assured her that they would be fine. He even recently hired a bodyguard recently!

As trucks enter the city limits and shots are fired, we are currently in limbo as Serov's loyalists attempt to extend their authority throughout the city - with no Syktyvkar, there is no control throughout the rest of the Republic, and if not handled carefully, everything could come crashing down.\n\nThe protestors that are staring down the barrels of our guns are just as adamant about removing Serov as Serov is about removing them. However - now that the National Army is prioritizing securing the streets of Syktyvkar and cauterizing the city, the commanders of the armed forces are of two minds in how to proceed with dispersing the protestors.\n\nThe first proposal, the more obvious one, is to use the might of the Komi National Army to break the protestors, disperse them with violence and street combat. This will ensure, of course, that the army demonstrates who is in control, but it will also likely cause unnecessary death in an army already stretched for manpower.\n\nThe second option proposes that Serov and the army send civilian infiltrators, associated with the military or Serov's supporters, into the protestors and ingratiate themselves with those who organized the protests.

If there was ever a time to strike and usurp the Republic in the name of the rightful Emperor of Russia, it was now.\n\nHe instructed his Court and commanders to grab the guns, the bombs, and the gas. No punches would be pulled in this crucial hour. The only question remaining for the Regent to answer was how to deploy these weapons. Taboritsky could target that cursed Bolshevik traitor Suslov, who has been directing the communists from the shadows. No doubt killing Suslov would be a wise decision, and he was most likely planning some foul operation to corrupt Syktyvkar even further. Alternatively, Taboritsky could target the centrists' 'emergency headquarters,' considering that Taboritsky's informants have located the building. Such a strike could decapitate the often irritating republican forces. Taboritsky was quite tempted to put the final nail in the Republic's coffin.\n\nWhile both factions would have to be purged so that Taboritsky could prepare Russia for the return of its rightful Emperor, there could be only one first strike. Once Taboritsky chose who to strike, the other would most likely prepare for such an attack, making the Regent's position less certain.

Suslov's men threw their weight against the door, but it wouldn't budge from its position.\n\nThe stormtrooper on the other side of the door stood at attention, rifle raised. His makeshift barricade was working, and now all that was left to do was confirm the kills. Slowly, the shouting and coughing grew quieter, and the loud thuds grew weaker and weaker.

Her days of wearing white her behind her now that bands of stormtroopers roamed the streets, it would make her too recognizable. She was escorted by a bodyguard in plain clothing, bearing an AK in case anything happened. As the building appeared before her, Stalina began to quicken her pace. Then Stalina heard gunfire, although she couldn't locate where it was coming from. A stormtrooper burst out of an alley nearby, but her bodyguard opened fire, shattering the man's gas mask. Stalina and her bodyguard took cover behind a nearby burnt-out car, what destroyed it, she had no idea.\n\nSuddenly, a truck burst out of the safe-house's garage, with nobody in the driver's seat. There must have been a brick on the accelerator, as it took off down the street and plowed into a nearby store-front, and the short silence afterwards was ended by an enormous explosion.\n\nStalina stared at the smoke and flames, before she heard a voice from behind, the voice of Ivan Morozov. He was wearing a cheap beige suit, standing next to Ivan Korolkov, who had a few more men behind him. Morozov was beckoning Stalina into the alley. Stalina stepped over the stromtrooper's corpse, and she was gone."

 KOM_right_coups.10.d: "グミリョフは椅子に座り、手紙の査読をした。この手紙は、右派の少数勢力であるロシア帝国復古協会の指導者セルゲイ・タボリツキーに宛てたものである。教会には、その規模に似つかわしくない優秀な突撃部隊や、指導者や大義のためには命すら投げ捨てるだろう狂信者が集まっている。タボリツキー自身もまた、ボリシェヴィキの処刑を免れたという皇帝アレクセイ2世に対しての狂信の態度を見せている。彼は結果として、グミリョフの抱える問題の端緒となっている。まず、アレクセイ2世と言う人間はほぼ確実にこの世にはいない。この点で、タボリツキーの精神構造を疑わざるを得ない。彼の主張は基本的に信頼できるものではないからだ。そして、グミリョフは王党派ではないしツァーリには興味がない。そして正直に言ってしまえば、タボリツキーには好感が持てないのだ。\n\n手紙の中で、グミリョフはタボリツキーのロシア帝国の最盛期の国境の再現という欲求に訴えかけ、その違いを乗り越えようとした。その中で、モスクワ、ウクライナ、カザフスタンやその他の地域の回復という、自然な提案がなされた。グミリョフはさらに飛躍して、アラスカ併合についても暗に示している。グミリョフは馬鹿馬鹿しいと思わざるを得なかったが、タボリツキーならこれくらいは普通のことだろう、とも考えた。\n\nさて、これは強力に見合うだけの利益を生み出すのだろうか？タボリツキーの私兵は確かに優秀だが、共和国の転覆を行うのに本当に必要なのだろうか？タボリツキーは強力な雄弁家で、支持基盤もそれなりに整っている。グミリョフのクーデターに君主主義者を巻き込めば、彼らの監視を怠った時に権力を奪おうと企んでくるのは予想のつくことだ。グミリョフは手紙を持ったまま悩んだ。部下にこれを燃やすよう頼み、タボリツキーを除け者にすることはできる。また、このふざけた手紙を送り、彼が提案を呑むのを待つこともできるだろう。"

 KOM_coups.284.t: "Further Escalation?"
 KOM_coups.284.d: "It was calm. Fighting had been low-intensity, at best, and major raids had been nonexistent over the past few days. Bukharina was aware that no one was finished, and that such a calm period was merely all sides reconsolidating their forces. She leaned back in her chair, drinking a cup of water. While it would be easy to wait for the other factions to make a move and respond from there, now was the perfect chance to make a move of her own.\n\nBukharina saw herself with two major options. First, she could move to lock down the streets, sweeping them clean of the opposition. Such a move would strengthen the internal security of Komi, and help stabilize the regime. Of course, this move would also move her to a more defensive stance as she consolidated her power in the territory she had.\n\nThe other major move she could make was to go after the leaders of the opposition. By cutting off the head of the snake, the opposition would be left prone, allowing her to solidly beat them. However, if the assassination attempts were to fail, the fighting would escalate dramatically, leading to more bloody and risky battles. There was a third option, where she locked down the streets and went after the leaders, but such a move could easily leave her overextended and prone to a countercoup. Bukharina gently rubbed her temples as she mulled over her options."
 KOM_coups.284.a: "Lock down the streets, we need internal security."

He gently rubbed his temples in an attempt to stave off his headache, to no avail. Did he have any meetings scheduled today? He tried to think through the pain in his head, the sporadic gunfire interrupting his attempts. Damn it, he couldn't remember. Maybe some water would help?\n\nMorozov greedily drank a cup of water, finding that he was parched. It tasted... off, to say the least, but it had tasted that way for a while. It was of no issue to him. He began walking back to his desk, accidentally bumping into the wall. Shit, how out of it was he? Maybe he should just try to sleep? Morozov stumbled to his room, finding that his center of balance was off. He fumbled with the doorknob, straining his eyes to focus on it.\n\nMorozov all but fell into bed, only just remembering to take his shoes off before pulling up the covers. Yes. A nice, long nap would be good, he thought, as he closed his eyes. He would never open them again."

Voznesensky has managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with Voznesensky's frankly astounding escape story, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown!

 KOM_coups.288.t: "The Assassination of Nikolai Voznesensky"
 KOM_coups.288.d: "Voznesensky awoke to a gun pointed at his face. Fuck. The soldier holding the gun gestured for him to get up. He reluctantly did, seeing that he had no other option. The soldier escorted him outside, to a truck. Voznesensky noted that some of his guards laid on the ground, dead. Damn it. He'd grown too used to the sounds of gunfire, and ignored it at a critical time. The soldier escorted him into the back of the truck, and it began to move.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Voznesensky realized something. There was only one guard. Maybe it wasn't the end yet. The soldiers hadn't tied his hands, confident that they could stop him. He just needed a distraction, and then he could make an escape. Voznesensky waited, knowing that something would come. This was Komi, after all. An thunderous boom suddenly echoed, leaving Voznesensky's ears ringing. Now was his chance! He leaped forward, punching the guard. The guard's head slammed into the side of the truck. Voznesensky turned and leapt from the back of the truck, tumbling on the ground. He shakily stood up, brushing himself off.\n\nThe truck had driven off, but he had to get away from here. Voznesensky turned down the first street he could, only to see a communist tank.. He tried to step back, hoping that he hadn't been noticed. The tank moved until the barrel of the gun was pointed at him. Voznesensky closed his eyes, knowing death was at hand. At least it would be quick."

Her guards were able to intervene before she was taken away by our soldiers, and she is now in a hidden location. Somehow, Stalina has managed to obtain access to a radio station, and has broadcasted all across Komi about our assassination attempt. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the democrats decrying our underhanded methods, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown!

 KOM_coups.290.d: "Stalina stepped outside, only to be met by communist militiamen. They pointed her guns at her, not even allowing her a chance to say a word before they grabbed her and put her in the back of an army truck. Shit. This was very bad. Was there any way for her to get out of this? Where had her guards gone? Stalina tried to figure out something, anything, but to no avail. After an hour, the truck stopped.\n\nStalina was escorted outside, into what appeared to be a small patch of forest, fairly distant from any life. Suddenly, it all became clear to Stalina what was going on. She was walking to her execution. Was there any way she could possibly escape? Stalina looked around, desperate. No. It seemed her death was inevitable. She took a deep breath.\n\nIf anything, Stalina would face her demise with dignity. After all, what else could she do? The soldiers stopped her. One of them offered a flask, filled with alcohol. She drank much more of it than she expected. It felt comforting, as much as liquor could possibly be. Stalina closed her eyes as the soldiers pointed their guns at her. She thought of her father, of the war, of everything she had done in Komi. Maybe in the end, it would be worth it. Maybe someone would rise to bring a better world to this mess of a planet. Maybe-\n\nStalina's thoughts ended, as the soldiers fired upon her."

The bomb meant to ignite when his getaway car started ended up failing to activate, and he managed to escape the soldiers raiding his compound, later finding the bomb. We can't conduct a follow up raid, as Gumilyov is now hidden somewhere in Komi. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the fascists decrying our underhanded methods as hypocritical as it may seem, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown!

He sprung from his bed, rubbing his eyes in an effort to wake himself up. He stumbled out of his bedroom, becoming more and more aware of the nearby gunfire. Shit. His guards escorted him towards the back, checking each room and hallway for a communist. The gunfire intensified, as they approached the outside. There would be hell to pay, Gumilyov swore to himself. No communist bastard would attack him and get away with it.\n\nAs Gumilyov stepped outside, he was struck by the utter pandemonium. The gunfire was constant, and although his destination was only a few steps away, it took nearly 5 minutes before he could successfully enter his backup truck. Unmarked, it was perfect for a getaway. One of his guards tried to start the engine. It sputtered and failed. Gumilyov felt a sharp pang of fear as the guard tried again, the engine again failing to start. He could feel his heart beat faster and faster. The guard tried one more time, finally getting the engine to start. Gumilyov didn't have time to feel relieved, for he was overwhelmed by a bright flash, tearing him and the entire truck to shreds."

Even so, his face as he stares at the Military Oversight Committee has to be seen to be believed. He looks like he has just seen the Devil in bed with his wife and with his wallet in hand.\n\nIt is fortunate that the General cannot escape this particular meeting through making foul faces - fortunate for the Republic, that is. A list of staffers and senior military advisors is thrown at his desk. An unsmiling Committee Deputy demands more names, training times, a full inventory of equipment. Gluchenkov growls that this is an unprecedented intrusion into Army business on the part of a few jumpstart apparatchiks. The Deputy, the iron showing in his face, points out that if the General does not hop to and give him names, the latter will soon have no business with the Army, or in Komi, or in the world of the living.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of such snarling, the General relents. He knows he's been dealt a losing hand.

 komi_democratic_smuta.3.d: "Even in our most turbulent and uncertain times, it is unlikely that someone could imagine that Syktyvkar, a mid-sized city at the entrance to the rear of Russia, could become a centre of the Russian Republican statehood and a small, if shining, gleam in the devastated country. Surviving its troubled transition to democracy and the attacks from radicals of all sides, Syktyvkar provided itself a special spot in the Russian history.\n\nAs some political workers of the Republic developed sentimentality towards the city with which they went through the hardest challenges in their lives, it is time to admit, however, that in the light of our current strategy, Syktyvkar no longer fits as a centre of the democratic Russian advancement. It is too far from the core of communications in West Russia, and too close to hostile forces.\n\nThe government has therefore taken up an initiative to move the capital to Vyatka, the former residence of the short-lived rule of the self-proclaimed Emperor, in order to address these issues. Whilst many officials express melancholy at needing to move, and there are widespread fears that the now-overshadowed city of Syktyvkar will be left neglected, general consensus is that the relocation represents the maturation of the Republic to a state capable of contesting all of Russia."

There would be no half-measures. Their democracy was too important to just let their enemies assassinate it in broad daylight. No, of course not. To protect their beautiful democracy, they needed to go after the people who would destroy it if given only the tiniest sliver of opportunity.\n\nThis really was the ideal position for her.

Sokolov never answered questions directly and never revealed who his clients were. For that matter, no one had seen the inside of his office either.

From a quick scan of the individuals present, more than half of his party had apparently disappeared overnight, seemingly without any trace.\n\nHe knew that the actual explanation was unlikely to be pleasant. Despite this, Lev's face remained fixed in a neutral expression, looking forward intently, so as not to betray any reaction. Now wasn't the time to show weakness to the other parties, not when the party's position is so frail. But inside he was both nonplussed and furious. Questions ran through his head at a rapid tempo. How were they so quick? What had happened?\n\nThe rest of the day was spent finding the answers. From snatches of rumors, speaking to his contacts, and making a few calls, he discovered the truth, which was largely what he had expected. His missing friends and comrades had been forced to resign, and those who hadn't complied were arrested.\n\nThis was, without question, a large setback for the Passionariyy - but their mission wouldnt be stopped.

Opposite them, Roman, the tallest of them, and from the city.\n\nIt was pleasant enough, chatting about simple things like that. But naturally, being the first day on the job for all of them, the conversation eventually shifted to matters of much higher relevance - namely, why they had decided to join the engineering corps of the Komi Republican Army.\n\n\"Simple enough.\" Vanya said with a shrug. \"I need the money. I heard they pay well, so all of this will be worth it.\" A hint of dourness appeared on his face. \" I hope they actually pay us on time.\"\n\n\"Its not just about that,\" Aleksei replied. \"Training is important, too. If you want to get a good job out of the army, youre going to need all the certificates and what-have-you - and theyre offering to pay for it. Its a good deal.\"\n\nRoman wondered why the other two boys were so cynical, but he supposed there wasn't anything particularly wrong with what they thought. Nevertheless, he took the opportunity to push back on their mere material motivations. \"Theres more to life than just money, you know.

He was here, in this damp classroom, of his own free will, for little financial gain, because he believed in them.\n\nBorisov learnt more from them than they could ever from him. The dimensions laid out in front of him, the colors of imagination dimmed by poor opportunities fascinated as much as they saddened. Whenever he thought with confidence on matters other than what he taught, they, in the unbridled variation of youth, would offer different perspectives. That intellectual invigoration was all he had in such impoverished times.\n\nThen, the world, in its unknowable movements, reared its head unexpectedly. No, something even more strange and random to Borisov: Government. Running to the door, he was met with a strange uniformed man with a stranger request, dressed in typical formalities. At the heart of it, however, was salvation. A formal request to contribute to writing a textbook in the relatively obscure field he taught in, and for a not inconsiderable sum of money.

Naturally, he needed the support of the Assembly, and so a bill was drafted for that exact purpose.\n\nWith the SMR's victory in the previous elections, it went without saying that the bill was going to be passed - and even if they didn't have a majority, few who would disagree with the need to unite Russia. Nevertheless, with the paper resting in front of him, it felt like he was standing at a critical moment in history. The full weight of this task, this duty, was upon him at that minute, at that second.\n\nSoon he, Ivan Morozov, would be leading the reclamation of Russia.\n\nIt was a daunting task, to be certain - but this didn't scare him. Ivan had lived long enough to know not to be scared of the future. He was the man in charge, and was more than prepared for the road ahead.\n\nIvan's mind - and then his eyes - turned to the pen on his desk. He picked it up, signed the bill to the applause of his guests and the clicking of cameras, then flashed a wry smirk to the crowd as he spoke:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen...\"\n\nHe let the silence hang in the air a bit, letting the anticipation build."

When we see explosives, do we picture a harsh, bitter, and permanent end? Or something to revel in, each detonation, under the scrutiny of hindsight, allowing for improvement? Is such growth, change, and evolution natural? Their trepidations waning somewhat, they find their new work somewhat more bearable.\n\nThe Smuta approaches, and all must do their part. The chemistry students are the new architects of war, taught how to fashion their understanding of the periodic table into explosive devices. All these young minds are funneled towards war.

The first was to immediately provide an accounting of all party spending, which they had to know was an unreasonable demand. Even if this wasn't clearly a thinly-veiled excuse for the government to find some irregularity and crack down, Matvey was uncertain if that information could even be provided. Which was to conveniently ignore that the leadership was simply not going to want to comply with that.\n\nYet the second demand was somehow worse - a demand to immediately divest from any businesses they had invested in, with an openly stated threat that non-compliance would result in state-seizure of said businesses. He'd done a few brief calculations - and while it wouldn't kill the party outright, it would practically ensure they couldn't grow. A slow death, where they'd wither in impotency.\n\nHe didn't know how he was going to share this with the party. What they could even do. Refuse? Grit their teeth and comply?

Now that you mention it...\" Roksana mused, pausing briefly, her features adopting a puzzled expression, as if coming to a realization. \"Yeah. It's weird.\"\n\n\"Think the communists did something?\" Alexei asked, kicking a stone in his path. The district they lived in, and walked everyday, was known to be a stronghold of the KPK. It was the communists that ran things here, so it would make sense if they'd been behind this. \"I've not heard anything.\"\n\n\"Not sure, but I don't think it's just here,\" Lev said. \"Talked with a few people in class, and they've all noticed the same thing. Not complaining, but I am curious.\"\n\nRoksana shrugged her shoulders. \"I guess. I'm just glad they figured something out.

An unopened, unmarked envelope rested on the coffee table in front of him. He didn't intend on opening it; he knew what it contained. He'd received no fewer than three such letters throughout the day of the same event - though he'd heard rumors of something like this being planned before today.\n\nHe'd wondered if they would do it. Now he had his answer. Valentin Varrenikov and Svetlana Bukharina, arrested on charges of terrorism. He personally could not help but find it darkly amusing that anyone could consider Bukharina a hardened terrorist. Please. The very idea was absurd. It was a pretext so thin it was to be transparent. Anyone could see this for what it was.\n\nBut of course, it wasn't about anything resembling 'plausible.' The charges were a fabrication; a front; a mechanism for delivering a message to certain people. In particular, people like him who represented one of the anti-electoralist parties. Historically, the government had accepted their presence, despite their hostility.\n\nIt seemed policy had changed. They were a liability now. Today it was Varrenikov and Bukharina, tomorrow it might not be him, but he would have to be blind to not see where this was leading. One by one, they would be picked off as the government purged the political spectrum of those who threatened their power.\n\nHypocrites, but hypocrisy was an expected virtue among the capitalist class. Not worth becoming offended over, it was their nature, just as natural to them as breathing. Nonetheless, this presented an issue for him.

While the law in front of him was not particularly revolutionary, what it signified was frightening.\n\nWith a few flicks of the wrist, he scrawled his name on the piece of paper. The action lasted only a moment and with it, the deed was done. As he watched the ink dry, his mind began to race with thoughts of the consequences. Soon new chaos would befall Russia, including the state which he was elected to lead. Destruction was not an impossibility, but neither was unification and victory.\n\nA sigh escaped the President. \"So it has been done.

The sun was out, but not blinding. The wind was refreshing, but not overpowering. The temperature was noticeable, but in a pleasant way. It of course meant nothing - but it almost felt like a sign of a newer, better era. Even though she knew what would have to come next.\n\nThe Republic's problems were far from over. Extremism and violence still bubbled under the surface, and would need to be dealt with. Which was to say nothing of the surrounding statelets who were eyeing them closely, as rumors of war circulated. It was not a surprise - all saw the unification of the Motherland as the greatest mission - herself no exception. Today was the first step in a new era for the Republic - and for Russia.\n\nAdorned in attire befitting a head of state, Stalina walked out onto the Presidential Palace Balcony, to the cheers of the people.

Stalina did not want to implement immediate martial law, as she believed - and other civilian officials concurred on - that the sooner civilian rule was established, the better.\n\nThe Act was intended to facilitate that by allowing Republican Army Officers to appoint civilian officials to government positions, in addition to expanding access to the government as they pertained to military intelligence. Reports, overviews, and analysis concerning the war, from the front lines, would be available to them, and subsequently allow them to be informed as to the state of the war.\n\nIt was the kind of useful, pragmatic legislation she expected of the legislature. Some were doubtless going to argue that giving the military powers to appoint civilian officials wasn't a good solution to the problem - however, it would be sufficient for what they needed. Besides, the people would be grateful that military rule was not being enforced.\n\nStalina signed her name on the document to the polite applause of the attendees, and to the snap and flash of cameras.

 komi_KPK.14.d: "Komi's President sat behind his desk staring down at a piece of paper of tremendous importance. The KPK leader surrounded himself with their closest advisors, all of whom had worked valiantly to see their party united and ready up until now.\n\nIn front of the President was the National Reclamation Act, perhaps one of the most impactful laws to ever be passed in the short republic's history. It was not difficult to pass, but the traitorous resistance from the opposition was still palpable over ideological differences. Regardless, with it, the unification of Russia would be one step closer, and the dreams of the KPK closer to realization.\n\nThe signing itself lasted only a few seconds. With a stroke of the hand, a signature was placed neatly onto the paper. The deed finally done, a huge wave of relief rushed over the President as they were quickly engulfed in congratulations by their surrounding ministers.\n\nSeeing it as an opportune moment, the President decided to provide some encouragement to their advisors. \"Well, it has been done. The reclamation of the USSR is now underway, it's only a matter of time now. This, however, is not the end of our work. Wars are still to be fought, and a revolution to be continued.\"\n\nAll mumbled in agreement, and soon the President had them pushed out to begin such work. Alone, the President looked at the paper one last time, letting the implications reappear as the relief vanished from their body. He then called in an aide and had it documented."

 komi_KPK.15.d: "Just above the streets of Komi, a single window was illuminated in the headquarters of the KPK. Inside, two party members in exhaustion poured over file after file about bureaucrats. The two men, Alexander Shepilov and Arvids Pelshe were of the old guard, now in their late 50s and early 60s, and still serving the party they were loyal to.\n\nThe current President had ordered the creation of a new state planning bureau, built from the ground up. In it, the two men were promised all the resources they would ever need, something that excited Shepilov and Pelshe. Unfortunately for them, the short notice required a new set of bureaucrats, which they were now stuck finding before their presentation deadline.\n\nPelshe let out a long sigh. \"I can't wait to finally have our own department. It will be just like the good old days before the Nazis invaded and ruined everything.\" He thought back to his life in Latvia. \"Perhaps our work can be used to liberate eastern Europe.\"\n\nShepilov stopped his work and looked at his older colleague. \"Perhaps someday, but that day will never come if we don't get this agency off the ground. If we want that dream we'll have to work for it together.\" A file was handed to Pelshe. \"Now how about we look at economists.\" Pelshe nodded in agreement, with a newfound commitment to his work.\n\nFinally, just before 2 AM, the pair had their list. Full of seasoned, trustworthy, and reliable bureaucrats that would be perfect for the department. With a big stretch, both men got out of their chairs and left home to get what little sleep they could salvage. Pelshe before exiting, turned off the lights, well aware they would be on when they came back in a few hours to report."

However, it was the calm before the storm, as the clouds that had previously surrounded the republic had finally crossed the border.\n\nOne of the Republic's army captains, a man named Kazimir, walked nervously to a new man in his unit. This new man was young and fresh out of school. He held a sense of idealism and optimism that had long vanished from the rest of the unit. However, despite his inexperience, he was equal to Kazimir himself, for he was the unit's new political commissar.\n\nKazmir cleared his throat and extended his hand. \"Nice to meet you! My name is Kazmir and I'm the captain of this little detachment. I hope your stay here is pleasant.\"\n\nThe young man looked at the Republican captain with suspicion but softened shortly after. He extended his arm to shake. \"I'm Iakov. This is quite the energetic group of comrades you have here. I hope they are well versed in party ideology?\"\n\nA nervous chuckle escaped Kazmir. \"Well, they could probably use some help, which I assume you'll be happy to provide, perhaps over a game of hockey? Sometimes the men like to play out a game on their breaks.\" Iakov had latched on to the talk, and Kazmir soon found himself in a bit of debate over technique with his new colleague.\n\nBoth men continued their discussion before Kazmir said something out of the blue. \"Things sure have been getting crazy recently, haven't they? I'm hoping we can come to some agreement working together with the upcoming war?\" Iakov looked at the man again, slowly nodding. The next few months would not be easy, Iakov thought, and any camaraderie he could make would be of great value."

 komi_dynamic_DSNP.1.d: "\"Thank you for meeting, gentlemen,\" Voznesensky greeted, taking a seat opposite the two men - Defense Minister Ligachev and Marshal Grigorenko respectively. \"I trust you've prepared for our discussion?\" The discussion in question surrounded the reclamation of Russia - the first step of which was securing the region west of the Urals. Once that was completed, they would continue sweeping east.\n\n\"As requested, Mr. President,\" Grigorenko nodded. \"We both have some proposals for you concerning the reclamation operations. One matter that we are at an impasse on is the management of local governments.\"\n\nVoznesensky nodded, unsurprised. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Barring a few exceptions, the governments in question are going to be hostile to us,\" Grigorenko continued. \"They are going to need to be replaced. Minister Ligachev is of the opinion that continuity of civilian government is essential. I've posited that until the war is concluded, we maintain military control.\"\n\n\"My counter to this is simple,\" Ligachev rested his clasped hands on the table. \"We are to win hearts and minds, not just land. While I have no doubt our soldiers could manage well enough, the optics are not ideal. We are a democratic nation - not a dictatorship or junta. Even if the government is hostile to us, I am certain we could find sympathetic people, who are respected in their communities. Mr. President, your opinion?\"\n\nAnd this was why he'd made Ligachev his Defense Minister. Grigorenko meant well, but he was a soldier. Komi was a republic, led by civilians, and Voznesensky believed that should be given priority. He was glad to see his choice had been vindicated."

Some were bored like a donkey, others piercing him like a vulture, others more with the naive innocence of a rabbit. However, all returned to the President, as he prepared for the uncomfortable process before him.\n\n\"I'm just going to cut straight to the chase. As we near the end of this Smuta, we are facing the problem of what to do with future elections. After all, the Republic is no longer just Komi, and our election times are no longer in sync. Changes are not a question of if, but what.\"\n\nVoznesensky turned his body to Chairman Rodionov next to him, giving his friend the floor to speak. \"Thank you, Mr. President. I propose a soft reboot to the election timings once things settle down more. It would be a good time to convene and reexamine the constitution while we're at it too.\"\n\nMurmurs filled the room at the thought of replacing the constitution, mostly from rogue RNP and KPK deputies. Accusations of revisionism carried across the room in anger. Voznesensky watched as deputy Stalina just rolled her eyes at the whining around her. Still, the SMR and PSD seemed fairly receptive, which was important.\n\nThe whining had mostly subsided, but not completely. Seeing an opportunity, Voznesensky decided to end the meeting. \"I think that's enough for today. This room needs to be cleared for a meeting with the generals anyway. We'll reconvene to discuss this constitution idea, with everyone that was here today.\" As people left, a huge sigh escaped the President. The hard part had been done. After all, he did not need everyone to agree with him."

The process was something he had grown familiar with over the years as President, and one he was none too fond of as a result. Yet this meeting seemed less toxic than previous meetings, both in language and procedure.\n\nHe watched as Chairman Rodionov guided the assembly along bill after bill. Procedures were not without arguments, but they passed all the same. Bill after bill meant for the war went through, the entire assembly united in the face of its destruction. From Voznesensky's position, he could swear he saw Rodionov enjoying himself for once.\n\nEven the RNP was supportive for once in their miserable existence, the ever annoying pricks, thought the President. His long bitter enemies now cooperating was something the President could scarcely think of a few years ago. Voznesensky began stroking his beard as a smile appeared on his face.\n\nConsidering the involvement of the KPK though, he stopped. It might not have been the old days with Zhandov, but he still expected more of them than this. Casting no votes made the party look suspicious. Voznesensky returned to stroking his beard, now in contemplation. He would need to poke them harder, maybe threaten his old friend with the threat of Stalina or the RNP.\n\nEventually, the session did end. Before he left, he walked up to his colleague to express his observations. \"That was a well-run session, Rodionov. Masterfully in fact. I could only dream of something like this during the early days of the republic.\" The Chairman only smiled before replying to his friend in earnest."

Every day he watched the clock, keeping track of the time so the steel factory did not overwork them. It was his job as the head of the local union. Now he was stuck watching it again in anticipation of their mysterious visitor.\n\nThis whole situation had weird written all over it. A few days ago he had received a telegram from the government requesting his union's presence with representatives of the company. Now the two of them were staring at each other in the cramped board room, looking as though they were in a stand-off ready to gun the other down.\n\nAt last, their mysterious arranger finally arrived. As he walked through the door, Onisim could barely believe his eyes. Before him was the Minister of finance Leonid Kantarovich. Now Onisim was confused even more with the whole ordeal. After all, what could a man like Kantarovich do meeting with a small local like his?\n\nThe finance minister cleared his throat. \"Good afternoon gentlemen. I apologize for my tardiness. I'm sure you are all curious why I have called you here today. Well, as part of new legislation by the National Assembly the government is in demand of some large quantities of steel. As a result, I have a government contract for the factory.\" Kantarovich reached into his jacket and plopped a stack of papers onto the table.\n\nEveryone in the room scrambled to grab a copy. As Onisim got a hold of one, what he saw was fairly generous. High worker compensation, representation on the factory labor board, reasonable pay, and safety conditions, it was amazing. He looked at his fellow union representatives to get their opinion. Overall everyone seemed similarly pleased. Before their corporate counterparts could beat them, Onisim got up and exclaimed to the Minister."

Some of the Republic's brightest and most dedicated individuals had been gathered in the room and now waited eagerly for him. At the front sat a lectern with a single long piece of parchment, the culmination of much discussion and hard work.\n\nVoznesensky's heart raced as he approached the front of the room. \"Good day, everyone. It is with much pride and excitement that we are gathered here today. For years this Republic has been plagued with uncertainty and distress. Now, in light of the triumph over the troubles of war, we have achieved something amazing. We finally have a new constitution to call our own.\"\n\nTurning away from the crowd, the President walked up to the lectern, grabbed a pen, and scribbled his name on the parchment. Like so many documents before, his signature carried its familiar smudges as his hands shook. However, instead of a fear of the future, Voznesensky's hand shook with excitement.\n\nFinishing, Voznesensky stepped aside to allow the others in the room to sign. Soon, signatures filled the bottom as excitement compounded from each following delegate. As the President stood back to watch the sight, a smile filled his face, pleased to find something truly hopeful in a country he had so often in the past watched tear itself apart.\n\nSoon, the room became enraptured in discussing their recent actions, and the President found himself conversing with Rodionov over their accomplishment. However, from the corner of his vision, the President was distracted by a strange man being the last to sign the parchment. He was nearly bald with bushy eyebrows and a thin mustache. He slipped out of his conversation to investigate the man's identity. Reaching the constitution, he discovered a most unfamiliar name written at the very bottom."

The rest of the General Staff similarly stood at attention as the President entered. Morozov nodded to them in return, motioning them to be at ease, and keeping his expression controlled as he took his seat.\n\nIt wasn't as though he was completely uncomfortable being here - Morozov was fairly confident that these men knew what they were doing, but he did not know them. Not in the ways that mattered, at least. All the same, this was an unfamiliar air here; one of strategy and scheming. Maps with battle plans were drawn up, and on the table; plans optimizing the methods of killing and war.\n\nThe uniformed General Staff only added to the militarized atmosphere. At heart, Morozov wasn't a military man, and being the only such person in the room that wasn't made him wary. Paranoid, perhaps, but he couldn't help it. \"The objective of this meeting is simple,\" Grigorenko stated. \"The coming reclamation of Russia. We've begun planning for this campaign. Korolkov, please continue.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" General Ivan Korolkov cleared his throat. \"If I could have your attention, President Morozov, we have a number of plans and initiatives that require your input. We do not have the manpower or resources to do all of them, and some executive decisions will need to be made.\"\n\nMorozov nodded, his mind transitioning to the conversation.

It was time for business to commence.\n\nMorozov looked toward Liberman before nodding to him. The Chairman began to speak. \"Good day everyone. We have called you here today to discuss, changes to the Republic. We're looking at rotating election dates for different seats, and staggering the voting process now that the Smuta is over. However, one of the ways we might achieve this is through a new constitution...\"\n\nWhile most seemed satisfied with the arrangement, not everyone was pleased. Notably, what was left of the RNP and KPK were particularly upset at the suggested arrangement. For once the two were united in screeching out their complaints. There it was, the President thought to himself as he watched the scene.\n\nDeputy Stalina was not having any of it though. Standing up, she slammed her fist into the table. \"Enough from all of you!\" She cleared her throat. \"I think the plan sounds ideal. The previous system has caused us many headaches in the past, benefitting the types of scoundrels we just won wars against. Now that nothing stands in our way, now would be the best time to do something, unless any other scoundrels would like to join their compatriots.\"\n\nThe speech did its job and the opposition had become particularly cagey. Pleased by the consensus, Morozov clapped his hands. \"Alright then, I don't believe we have anything left to discuss. You are all dismissed.\" As people left the room, Morozov stayed, watching the window. What was difficult was done, soon a new Republic, in his image, would be made."

No shouting, no bickering, no sudden threats of violence or assassination. Just a cooperative group of people working a bill through like a sane group of individuals.\n\nThe sight was baffling to Morozov, if not borderline suspicious. Yet he watched as Liberman steered the assembly along passing an emergency bill extending the funding of bridges across the Vytalka. In the past, there would have been cockamamy accusations of monarchism and betrayal. Now, Liberman calmly answered questions before the bill passing the bill with an overwhelming majority.\n\nAs the session drew to an end, Morozov could only stare bewildered from his seat. He had worked to reform the state into something proper, but he expected something to go wrong as it often did in Komi. Especially during a war, there should be at least some chaos!\n\nWaking from his confused daze, he called up Liberman to ask him what he had just seen before his colleague could leave. \"That was an awfully smooth session there Liberman, how did you do it? Bribes, blackmail, threats? Or did I die from some shell while visiting troops last week?\"\n\nLiberman let out a hearty laugh before looking at his boss and answering his question. \"Well Morozov, that is how a good democracy works, not the hair-brained system we had before.

Even his face was drab, defined with those jowls and folds that seemed to grip every bureaucrat by middle age. Nothing about him seemed to deserve a second thought - yet Yogush couldn't help but pay attention regardless.\n\nThe man continued. \"I was recently given a requisition form for a series of river barges. After a short review, a shortlist of possible companies was found, and upon close inspection by a small team of close associates, it was clear your company was best. As this order is of such a great scale, I felt it best to deliver it in person.\"\n\nA little confused, Yogush began to open the envelope. The contract unfurled below him. Some hundred ships were being ordered, several to exact specifications. No private enterprise could afford this much. The only one who could was...\n\nYogush's eyes turned to the man sitting across from him. \"You're here from Syktyvkar?\"\n\nA hint of surprise flashed upon the man's face. \"Oh!

Behind him, on a lectern, a single piece of paper laid the center of attention of the entire occasion.\n\nHe tapped the microphone before speaking. \"Good day ladies and gentlemen. Today we are gathered for what has been one of the greatest accomplishments in our nation's history. For years Komi's constitution has been riddled with holes, leaving the state in political chaos. Now, we stand here today prepared to sign a new constitution.

After the dead had been done he quickly stepped aside to make way for its next signor, Chairman Liberman. Soon a stream of deputies and ministers flowed to the parchment as names were added.\n\nStepping back, the President took a moment and watched the sight. What had been achieved was truly impressive. The members in the room had made for a truly diverse set of minds. In one corner he could see the socialist provisional governor of Arkhangelsk talking with a particularly curious conservative from across the Vytalka.\n\nIt was funny, the President thought. For so long the two men would have been at each other's throats in the past. Now the two Alexanders before him were discussing like rational individuals, even if they did not always agree.

I am confident that a majority of these plans can be converted into proper offensive campaigns.\"\n\nShe nodded sharply. \"Grigorenko, Pokus, Korolkov, is this feasible? More importantly, will it be effective?\"\n\nGeneral Yakov Pokus spoke for the men she'd called out. \"I believe it is, for the most part, Madam President,\" he said. \"Obviously, there isn't a clear conversion, but given the limited time, this will allow us to prepare our forces for a campaign, with minimal disruption.\"\n\n\"We have to distribute this to our subordinates,\" General Korolkov added. \"While completely new plans would be optimal, without preparation, it could cause confusion instead of clarity.

If we don't unify the Urals within four years, we hold new elections. Although, codifying such a thing might require some changes, such as a new constitution.\" Stalina looked around the room to find it surprisingly calm with the new suggestion.\n\nIn fact, the room found itself in complete agreement with the Chairwoman's suggestion. Not a single complaint was raised, including from the two-party heads. Knowing the two, they probably saw it as an opportunity to take her spot, Stalina thought. However, that would not happen, she would make sure of it.\n\nThe rest of the meeting dragged on, settling the finer details of things. However, the framework was set.

No fascists attempting to rebuild the state in the image that destroyed it. Just honest democrats doing the work that should have been done in the first place.

There was no yelling among the parties, no threats, and no risk of assassination. All Stalina heard was music, the music of rational debate of sane individuals, free of moronic ramblings. It was even without the threat of those no-good extremists, at that! Indeed, the finely crafted ballet was a magnificent sight to the President, she would have to come back again sometime.\n\nAt last, the play had to come to an end.

It would help in securing your trucks.\"\n\nGrigorenko scratched his chin for a bit before reaching out his hand again. \"Fair enough, you've got yourself a deal.\" Kantorovich smiled knowing he could come through for his boss. As he left the General's tent though, a slight unease followed him. His task was not yet done, and he now had to convince his prospective company with little more than a hefty IOU."

 komi_dynamic_PSD.5.t: "The Start of Something Powerful"
 komi_dynamic_PSD.5.d: "Power was something Stalina had craved throughout her life. She had grown familiar with it through her father, but never truly tasted it until she arrived in Syktyvkar. Now, standing before an assembly of delegates from across West Russia, she could no longer deny her label as anything less than strong, as she prepared to change the face of Russian and world politics forever.\n\nStalina spoke into the mic in front of her. \"Thank you to everyone here today. For years this Republic has been plagued with the instability of a weak government wrought upon us by the weak constitution of our forebears. However, now, with the hard work put in by everyone here, we can finally claim the powerful unifying government Russia has always deserved.\"\n\nThe President turned around and walked to the lectern. Grabbing a pen, she stopped before signing. \"With my signature, this constitution will carry us into a new age, one of a someday unified Russia!\" In an instant, Stalina signed her name and turned around to be greeted by applause.\n\nGetting out of the way, a line of people soon developed in her place. First was Chairwoman Bonner, followed swiftly by several ministers and delegates. Standing back, Stalina watched as the group before her dutifully signed off on her greatest accomplishment. A smile appeared at the wonderful sight, knowing that all her hard work had paid off.\n\nEventually, the line dwindled, and its previous occupants began talking in the euphoria of the event. President Stalina was no different, finding her way to particular members to network. In particular, were the three Alexanders, new provisional deputies whose influence grew fast in a short time. Solzhenitsyn, Yakovlev, and Kazembek were all curious men, Stalina thought, but she would find ways to work with them in all due time."

 KOM_stal_smuta_to_embolden_the_nation_desc: "The people of Russia are tired of war. Trapped in an eternal battle, they feel lorded over by armies, foreign forces who pillage their lands and give little in return. Decades of poor rule by poor rulers have drained the morale from the people of Russia.\n\nYet this is no reason to give up the fight. Instead, we must bridge the gap between our military and our people. Through recruitment campaigns, we can bring the people closer to their army. Through military reconstruction and service, we can show the people how their soldiers can come to their aid. Through improved training, we can be certain our army is loyal and just. In time, the people will come to see just how good their army truly is."
 komi_SMR.9.t: "Exploiting the Spoils"
 komi_SMR.9.d: "Factories, farms, mines, weapons, and many, many workers. Every day there were new reports that detailed the numerous economic resources acquired as Komi soldiers swept across West Russia. The volume of what was being recovered initially seemed overwhelming, and the task enormous - but they needed to focus.\n\nThe only thing worse than no resources was failing to employ what they gained.\n\nThere had been numerous meetings over the past few days discussing this exact situation - and assess how, exactly, to capitalize on all of these new resources that they were acquiring, be they materials, men, or weapons.\n\nThere were factories to repair and staff, mines to open and extract, and logistical networks to establish across all of the reclaimed territory. Which was to say nothing or hiring and organizing people to fill all of these new positions. In some cases the original workers would be around, but there were plenty that weren't.\n\nSo long as the Smuta continued onward, they needed to exploit every possible advantage they possessed, for their enemies certainly were. Even if they were not, something such as this could not be left to chance. Long into the night Morozov and his cabinet worked, hashing out the details while aides ensured they were written down and distributed.\n\nIt would be the first night of many more, but they weren't deterred. Morozov knew they would just work another. They would keep working until West Russia was under their control. Then, and only then, would he allow himself to rest."

 komi_SMR.10.t: "Present and Future Pragmatism"
 komi_SMR.10.d: "The room applauded and cameras flashed as President Morozov signed the legislation in front of him, lifting it up and letting the cameras capture the moment. A wide smile was on his face, one that was echoed by everyone else who was present, especially his cabinet, his colleagues, and businessmen who stood behind him.\n\nThe Technical Development Act was a testament to the ability of the legislature to efficiently work during wartime, as well as recognizing the future challenges they would face. Reclaiming Russia was only the first step - for everyone knew that one day, Germany would be on the horizon, and Russia would be avenged.\n\nBut Germany was also far more advanced and powerful. they possessed technologies and weapons that they couldn't match right now. They were richer, better resourced, and their empire spanned continents.\n\nRussia would need to even the playing field, and the Act would allocate generous amounts of funding to begin that process. The dividends might not pay off for years, but when they did, it would place the Republic in a good place. If it would be enough remained a question, but such could be adjusted as time went on.\n\nIn the short-term, it would serve another purpose. Dispensing with the previously complicated process of private acquisition, a new streamlined process had been created, which would allow private sector investment and purchasing of industry and infrastructure that had been reclaimed.\n\nIt wasn't to say that all the red tape was gone - but the more egregious parts were, and now these industries could be put back to use as soon as possible. Morozov stood and shook hands with a few businessmen who would be making the first purchases, as a new phase in both the war and Republic began."

 komi_DSNP.12.d: "Free time was a luxury these days.\n\nEver since the Smuta had begun in earnest, Voznesensky had found that there was barely even a few minutes where he was free. Be it continuous reports from the frontlines, meetings, strategy discussions, and the other responsibility of leading a nation, there was almost no time for himself. Not anymore, and he didn't think it would change until the war was over.\n\nThough at least for now, there was a slight reprieve.\n\nVoznesensky figured it was only a matter of time before this changed. And still, even with this reprieve, work dominated his thoughts; one issue in particular had grown in concern over the past few days. Morale on the homefront could be fickle, and there were signs that it was wavering, and subsequently, needed to be addressed.\n\nHis advisors were aware of this, but he feared that if it wasn't pressing like a hundred other things, it would fall to the wayside until it was too late. As such, their ideas proposed had been...lacking.\n\nHe didn't want to rely solely on propaganda, overreliance on that was a bad thing, in his experience. When it came to messaging, people needed to believe in the messenger, just as much as the message. A personal touch, perhaps; authenticity was one of the most potent elements in any successful messaging campaign. The President needed to be seen, to meet with the newly liberated peoples, and rally the troops.\n\nIf the people at home saw their leader personally doing the work, they would believe in him. In war, belief was something that was valuable. Yes, there was something here. On a scrap of paper, he wrote down a few notes to save for later. His advisors would be able to refine this further."

 komi_DSNP.13.t: "Spoils to the Liberated"
 komi_DSNP.13.d: "Voznesensky smiled as the press filed into the auditorium, speaking on the sidelines as he waited for everyone to move into their positions. After a few minutes, it was time and he took a seat at the table, with the legislation resting in front of him. Behind him stood members of the party, several military officials, and a few workers from newly liberated territories.\n\nThe Industrial Distribution Act. A piece of legislation that he was fairly confident wouldn't have been able to be passed in peacetime - at least not without controversy and a lot more debate. Now, with a stroke of a pen, the workers of the newly reclaimed territories would be given full collective ownership of their workplaces - with a few conditions.\n\nThere would need to be at least fifty workers for this to take effect, though in practice Voznesensky expected there'd be some exceptions for factories near that threshold. It remained to be seen, but it had been received quite positively by the workers, even if some of the more conservative politicians grumbled at the so-called 'communist' legislation.\n\nIn truth, the move was just as pragmatic, as it was ideological. They were taking territories with significantly different economic models, and there was no faster way to break the economic norms than democratizing as much of the economy as soon as possible. Voznesensky didn't really consider it deceptive - as far as he was concerned, everyone got what they wanted.\n\nWhen the pen was put to paper, the Act was signed into law, to the applause of those present. With a wide smile on his face, he shook the hands of the workers for the cameras, and departed only a few minutes later. An important step had been taken, but there remained more work to do."

 KOM_unstable_victory.233.d: "Ivan Morozov stares unenthusiastically at the meeting table. It is not the nice warm bed with a glass of warm water he was hoping for, especially after the chaos of the evening. The dossier on his desk covers an expected topic, blanketed on the cover like an obscene joke - RADICALISM IN KOMI. He flicks through the pages, his frown intensifying at the red names and cancellations on some of the pages - evidently taken from the Democratic Coalition's own census rolls.\n\nThere are quite a lot of cancellations.\n\nVoznesensky has the smile drip off his face, and he faces the assemblymen with little more than a ghost of a facial tic. He has at least the courage to be honest, even if what he is saying will make their jobs far harder than before.\n\n\"Morozov spoke to me this evening, after the end of debate. He says some of his men have lost confidence in the Coalition. They're writing the letters as we speak, and after tomorrow we will lose about 30 men. These men are - were - our majority in the Parliament. We will move to formalize relations with the Communists and the Passionariyy Party in tomorrow's session.\"\n\n\"There are still options. We are, after all, the incumbent - and our policies, while leaning on majority rule, are not entirely dependent on it. And after that-\"\n\nHe stops, but the meaning in his silence is clear. It is unthinkable, the democrats of Komi plotting the arrests of their opposition. And yet - perhaps it is the necessary option.\n\nMorozov rides the tide of opinion. He clears his throat."

All of us were once novices in politics, thrust into the Assembly by fate and desperate need. This was an unexpected Republic, and we were unexpected Republicans.\"\n\nStalina pauses, surveys the crowd. Old instincts kick in - her left flank's a little cold. Time to amp it up a little.\n\n\"And who among us does not remember the old years? The arguments we used to have, before Vosenevsky brought us into Coalition and Opposition, about how this Republic would be. Who would stay in Parliament when a thousand dreams clashed at once? How would we solve the problems of the citizen when our castles in the sky waited to be built?\"\n\nA little laughter, rueful almost. It's working. Stalina turns back to the main topic. Easy does it - like riding a horse.\n\n\"My point is this: it was not because of the beauty of our dreams that we have kept our Republic, as the Union fractured and the old world died around us. It was not ideals that kept us fed, or clothed, or safe. Many assemblymen deny it even now - but it was the common belief we are sworn to uphold, the dream of a Congress for and of all, working not towards paradise, but upwards from the present.\"\n\n\"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat.

The gunshots continue, at irregular intervals, until they are silenced, and from the east of the auditorium muffled cries and the sound of fistfights echo.\n\nThen another burst of fire, this one rapid and shallower, from the top of the tripartite stage above her. Screams, and the distinct thud of flesh hitting lead. Stalina's world tunnels in on itself, to the narrow web of cover that leads to the exit. Grunting slowly from the bruise in her side, she moves forward, ever forward, at what feels like the pace of a snail.\n\nAs the auditorium roars with gunfire behind her, Stalina keeps her face set, only allowing herself the pleasure of a single thought."

It is as if the speech had been given over a dead mike - the crowd certainly doesn't seem to have heard anything.\n\nAs the audience disperses, Grigorenko winces and prepares to leave.

The other strategy is to grab as many files as we can, sort out the contents, and act upon whatever useful information we happen to come across.

We've also arrested or killed some of the more experienced paramilitary commanders, crippling their forces' ability to organize. It seems the radicals had been expecting an attack, but our forces must have prepared faster than they had predicted, considering how unprepared the enemy was.

At the very least, our raids mean they can't rise up immediately, and we have likely significantly delayed their plans.\n\nThe time we've bought with these raids is precious. We must use them to further secure our position, further prepare ourselves for possible coup attempts, and further consolidate our rule by other means. While these raids are successful, raids alone can't save our Republic. The radicals will also learn from this raid, and will likely better secure their intel and weapon stockpiles. They have been wounded, but their wounds are certainly not fatal. We need to invest in propaganda, we need to introduce reforms, and we need to win over the Komi's citizens. If we can get the civilians to feel safe and support us, the radicals will lack enough support to strike against our government. That is how democracy survives."
 KOM_unstable_victory.251.a: "This is merely the end of the beginning."
 KOM_centre_coups.293.t: "Expelling the Radicals"
 KOM_centre_coups.293.d: "As stability returns to the Republic, it is the government's responsibility to ensure the maintenance of order. The political radicalism that brought Syktyvkar to the brink of civil war cannot continue if Komi is to be the successor of the Russian nation. The democratic coalition needs to be able to identify and deal with extremists, and to do that it needs to delve deep into the government.\n\nThe radicals would never have gotten as far as they did if it had not been for a large network of sympathizers that penetrated wide segments of society, up to and including the government. Bureaucrats on the left and the right provided covert aid and deflected blame for their crimes. For a liberal republic to function, it cannot trust ideological opponents of democracy to run it.\n\nThe age-old question of liberty or security presents itself once again. The first option is to conduct limited sweeps, retaining especially experienced, trustworthy, or repentant officials. The second is to fire even all of those who were merely associated with the extremists, if only to be sure."
 KOM_centre_coups.293.a: "Only a dictator would persecute so many political opponents."
 KOM_centre_coups.293.b: "Fire them all. It's the only way to be sure."
 KOM_centre_coups.294.t: "A Compromise Candidate"
 KOM_centre_coups.294.d: "Within the large democratic coalition formed in the aftermath of the coup and counter-coup, there are already tensions. The SMR, PSD, and DSNP are parties with great and substantial differences that are difficult to reconcile even with the necessity of a united front against radicalism. If they are allowed to simmer, these divisions may lead to the splintering of the coalition, a death sentence for Komi's fragile political order.\n\nEven symbolic overtures have value in these trying circumstances. To show good faith, the ruling party will replace the Chairman of the National Assembly with a representative of another party in order to emphasize the unity of the governing bloc in its respect for democratic values. As there are two subordinate parties, and obviously only one Chairman, the government will need to make a choice. Whose support is most necessary to ensure stability? Which party will have the President's ear, and which can safely be sidelined?"
 KOM_centre_coups.294.a: "Komi needs the PSD's strong hand. Choose Stalina."
 KOM_centre_coups.294.b: "Only the DSNP can placate the masses. Choose Kantorovich."
 KOM_centre_coups.294.c: "The SMR knows what must change. Choose Morozov."
 KOM_centre_coups.295.t: "Locking Down the Government"
 KOM_centre_coups.295.d: "While radicals don't believe in democracy, they will certainly take advantage of it. Either by entering the legislature or infiltrating the bureaucracy, they undermine the government from within to foment dissatisfaction among the people. Despite the ruling coalition's hard work, all it would take is a wave of radical candidates capitalizing on a disgruntled public to bring Komi crashing back down into chaos. Until the situation is under control, they must be frozen out by any means necessary.\n\nWhile not ideal, delaying elections and suspending appointments is a must for the short term. Blocking communists and fascists from the government will, over the long term, weaken them by denying them the platform they crave, and it will allow the democratic parties the time they need to stabilize the political situation. By carefully screening candidates, the government can ensure that officials seek to serve the people over their ideologies.\n\nThe state can see far, but it can't screen everyone. Perhaps it would be a better idea to focus on shutting down just the strongest organization's attempts to infiltrate the political system, rather than needlessly diluting its power. As both the left and right rebuild in silence, it may not be so easy to tell which one is the closest to striking again."
 KOM_centre_coups.295.a: "Take down the Reds."
 KOM_centre_coups.295.b: "Don't let a single fascist in."
 KOM_centre_coups.296.t: "Outside Assistance?"
 KOM_centre_coups.296.d: "The political violence that shook Komi until recently has significantly depleted the supply of reliable soldiers. Large numbers of fighting-age men joined radical organizations and were consequently deemed unreliable for recruitment into the military. Outside of Komi, however, there is no shortage of men with many guns and few principles.\n\nVologda, with its supply of weapons and lack of severe politicization, has great potential as a source of soldiers, and a delegation of mercenaries from there has in fact already contacted the government, expressing willingness to fill the gaps in our security in exchange for generous compensation. They claim to be veterans of the West Russian War with a significant amount of experience and seemingly have no loyalties besides the pecuniary.\n\nWith anti-state sentiment as widespread as it is, mercenaries may be the most loyal force Komi can find on short notice. More importantly, the state is hardly in a position to turn them down. Nevertheless, some in the government argue that those who don't believe in its ideals cannot be trusted to protect democracy."
 KOM_centre_coups.296.a: "Komi needs every man it can get."
 KOM_centre_coups.296.b: "Our safety isn't for sale."
 KOM_centre_coups.297.t: "Traitors Among Us!"
 KOM_centre_coups.297.d: "There were those in the government who raised hell over the decision to hire mercenaries, calling it a close-minded, foolish move that would only endanger Komi in the long run. Recent events have more than earned them an apology.\n\nThe mercenaries hired from Vologda deserted only weeks after they arrived, citing low pay and unfair restrictions put on them by the state. To \"compensate\" themselves for their trouble, they carried off a treasure trove of loot from several of Syktyvkar's banks in the process. Their loyalty to the Republic was clearly illusory, but their military experience was very real, as they brutally demonstrated to a patrol sent out to stop them. Now, with fifteen casualties and a gaping hole in the front lines, the military situation is worse than before they were invited in.\n\nThe government will have its hands full trying to manage the public relations disaster in the coming weeks, but an even greater issue looms overhead: with too few soldiers and a clearly unreliable mercenary base, how will it defend the people of Komi?"
 KOM_centre_coups.297.a: "A military fiasco."
 KOM_centre_coups.298.t: "The Curfew"
 KOM_centre_coups.298.d: "The city of Syktyvkar has recently enacted a 9:0 PM curfew, for the sake of security and curbing radical activities. The reaction of the citizenry has been mixed to say the least. Komi's people have always had an uneasy relationship with their government, and while some dutifully obey the restrictions, others flout them en masse.\n\nThose working late shifts or making midnight shopping trips have no intention of going along with the new rules. This puts the government in an uneasy position. The curfew needs to be enforced if it is to have any effect on security, but asking already struggling people to neglect their livelihoods is obviously unfeasible. Is there a middle ground? How many restrictions are reasonable when the average person has only a small chance of coming into danger?\n\nThe opinions of the government are divided. The more liberally minded believe the current measures to be unreasonable and possibly counterproductive. Others believe them to be too lenient, and a third faction has tried to stake out a compromise, with armed escorts returning violators harmlessly to their homes."
 KOM_centre_coups.298.a: "Excessive policing will only harm public morale."
 KOM_centre_coups.298.b: "Armed escorts are both secure and flexible."
 KOM_centre_coups.298.c: "There's no such thing as too many night patrols."
 KOM_centre_coups.299.t: "Night Raids"
 KOM_centre_coups.299.d: "By this point, Komi's democratic hardliners must feel like Cassandra of Troy. Their warnings against a premature relaxation of the curfew were ignored by the government at its own peril, and they appear to have been proven right.\n\nThe decrease in policing following the lessening of restrictions caused an almost immediate uptick in violent crime and terrorism. Over twice as many incidents occur at night when compared to the period of extensive enforcement, and multiple government installations have fallen under attack by unseen elements. While concerns over the impact of heavy enforcement on civilians were understandable, they sorely underestimated the extent to which chaos still reigns on the streets of Syktyvkar. Now, as weeks of carefully earned progress start to unravel, the politicians who advocated for such measures have only themselves to blame.\n\nThe sole silver lining of this situation is a broader consensus that the government needs to take a firmer stance. If the hardliners' counsel falls on more receptive ears, future crises may be resolved with the appropriate amount of force."

Replacements will be determined by the leader of the coalition. As the leading representatives of their respective parties, party leaders who reject the coalition or publicly undermine its authority will be expelled and prosecuted for treason.\n\nAll legally recognized parties which refuse to join the coalition will be considered threats to the stability of the Republic and consequently outlawed.\"\n\nThe Directive complete, Stalina leaned back from the typewriter. Perhaps it could be more formal, but what was formality in these times? It certainly wasn't of any use at the moment, with the Assembly in total chaos and more than a few members dead or missing. Still, at least a semblance had to be maintained if the Republic's legitimacy was to be salvaged - for that, the PSD would need a respectable partner.\n\nA burst of gunfire in a distant street sounded through her office's sole window - a reminder of the urgency of her endeavour. A decision had to be made, lest such violence draw any closer."

The extant structure of the Komi Police Force shall be maintained, pending...\"\n\nThe typewriter's clacking ceased as Stalina's fingers stopped in midair. She hadn't really considered reorganization when first formulating the idea of militarizing the police. It seemed logical - why put them under military command but maintain their same ineffectual structure? She leaned onto her desk, steepling fingers in thought. Subordinating the notoriously weak-willed police commanders to reliable military officers would probably provide better results, but the success of that move could not be guaranteed; the police were ferociously independent, after all. Perhaps a slower, more... organic approach might work? Of course, that would mean leaving the police and military to sort it out themselves. There was no guarantee that would work, either. Maybe taking charge herself would be wiser after all."

 KOM_stalina_coups.302.d: "Predictably, the Komi Police have proven as useless as ever. Their 'organic' reorganization has been completed, but not without days-long arguments, multiple resignations and more than a few arrests of problematic elements. The effectiveness of the police has been severely hampered by these setbacks and radical civilian elements are running rampant with the army pre-occupied dealing with the paramilitaries.\n\nThe police chiefs are back to work and have set their men to putting out the fires, but our government's image has taken a severe hit from its failure to reorganize law enforcement. It will be weeks before the police are able to quell the consequent unrest."

 KOM_stalina_coups.303.d: "Grigorenko reports that he and the police chiefs have successfully hashed out a blueprint for a smooth, rational reorganization of the Komi Police Force into an arm of the military. Small concessions have been made to appease the understandably nervous police, but we have gained far more than we've ceded from this effort.\n\nPolice detachments are now learning to work effectively in tandem with army units and friendly paramilitaries. Civilian unrest is being rapidly quelled with the police no longer having to worry about attack by well-armed radical groups, providing a tremendous boost to morale."
 KOM_stalina_coups.303.a: "Blue and green, working in harmony."
 KOM_stalina_coups.304.t: "A Successful Reorganization"
 KOM_stalina_coups.304.d: "Grigorenko reports that the Komi Police, having accepted President Stalina's orders without quarrel, have been successfully subordinated to his officers without too much trouble. There has been some grumbling at the sudden militarization of police ranks and conduct, but they understand their duty to the Republic.\n\nBoth civilian and paramilitary radicals are being pushed back throughout the Republic, with police and soldiers working together well. There remains much for them to do, but President Stalina's reorganization has made our security forces far more effective than they used to be."

However, her elation was short-lived as, once again, the sound of a large mob assembling outside reached her ears. Doubtless some radical sympathizer in the Assembly had caught wind of her intention to crack down on protests and spread it to the public. As of the moment she finished typing it, however, it had become law - one word to the head of security downstairs, and the rowdy plebs outside would be dispersed or otherwise dealt with.

Our informant's tip-off was correct - the Communist Party's headquarters was not in fact abandoned. A bunker beneath the building, probably dating back to the first German invasion, was serving as their base of operations. The main entrance, hidden in the building's archives room, was sealed. Our troops were forced to resort to explosives to breach it.\n\nFortunately, the communists had not been alerted to our discovery of the bunker. They were caught completely unaware by the assault team, who met minimal armed resistance and suffered no casualties. Some of the traitors were able to escape into tunnels exiting elsewhere in the city, but Suslov himself was still in his office when our troops found him. He had to be bloodied a little before being cuffed, but is in good health and awaiting your judgement.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

When the assault team breached the bunker, all they found were empty rooms. The armory, archives and offices were all stripped bare, leaving only things like furniture behind.\n\nThere were a dozen tunnels leading out of the bunker, exiting all over the city, so there's no indication of where Suslov might have fled to. Knowing him, he probably has several bolt-holes in every district. We've no idea where to begin searching. Awaiting further orders."

 KOM_stalina_coups.309.t: "The Execution of Mikhail Suslov"
 KOM_stalina_coups.309.d: "Frigid Ural winds drew moisture from Suslov's eyes as the bag was finally ripped from his head. Blinking and looking around, he saw his guards arrayed in a circle around him, faces stony and eyes filled with contempt. Beyond them was... trees? No, a forest. That must have been why they disembarked from the truck hours ago and continued on foot to wherever Stalina had ordered them. They had travelled by road for at least six hours, so they were clearly some distance from Syktyvkar. Yet, the President herself had not accompanied them. Perhaps the cause was not yet lost...\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he began. \"Please, consider for a moment what you have been-\"He got no further. Something hard cracked against his skull, causing him to stagger forward and bump against a guard, who shoved him back. \"Shut up,\" spat the sergeant, who stepped forward and produced a small scrap of paper from his pocket. \"Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, you have been accused of operating an illegal paramilitary, theft of state secrets, 71 counts of blackmail, 342 counts of conspiracy to murder, one count of murder-\"\n\nSuslov sputtered, words finally failing him. \"Tha... this is preposter-\"\n\nThe sergeant paused for a moment as someone else slugged Suslov in the side. \"Thanks, Ilya. You are also accused of acting as a hostile agent and carrying out acts of espionage for a foreign power in attempts to subvert the laws and constitution of the Komi Republic. The court finds you guilty, and sentences you to be shot.\"\n\nSuslov blanched, a ghost in the fading light trickling through the canopy overhead. He opened his mouth to speak - then heard the distinct sound of an AK being cocked. \"What do you think you're...\" The rifle cracked, but there was no sudden crunch of Suslov's skull shattering. Instead, he toppled to the ground with a gasp as the bullet punched through his tattered shirt and deep into his gut.\n\nHis world faded into a blur of browns and greens as someone kicked his glasses away and crushed them underfoot. Then the pain hit - a sudden, unbearable rising of blood and bile from the core of his body. Suslov screamed as he felt the lump of hot lead lodged somewhere beneath his stomach. \"You fucking bastards! Just... god- FUCK!\" The blurs of grey standing above him began to move out of sight, their footsteps muffled on the layer of moss and fallen leaves. \"NO! No, don't... don't just leave me here! What-?\"\n\n\"That's all you get, you rat,\" someone called back to him as they moved further away. \"Let's see you slip out of this one.\""

As you suspected, he was still in the city itself, probably to coordinate the rightist paramilitaries. He was running his operations out of a district post office previously thought secure. Recon informed us that the building was heavily defended by concealed machine gun positions, so a stealthy approach was out of the question. We rolled up a BT-76, which drew their fire and kept them suppressed as our assault teams moved in.\n\nHeavy fighting followed the breach. Assault teams reported final tallies as five of ours wounded and two killed, with all twenty-four enemy combatants neutralized. Gumilov was cornered in the postmaster's office, but took us all by surprise when he threw himself through the window rather than be taken by our men. It wasn't much of a fall, but he was bleeding quite badly. The medics patched him up just fine - at least, once our boys had stopped kicking him for giving them the runaround.

We only expected to face machine gun nests and a platoon or two, but they'd turned that place into a damn fortress. We brought in a PT-76 to take out the MGs, but they had enough RPGs to turn it into burning scrap in the space of thirty seconds.\n\nWe suffered too much attrition, got too frustrated. The assault teams got reckless and tried to advance without cover - got torn to pieces. We didn't have the numbers to keep fighting when the rightists staged a breakthrough in a couple of trucks and sped off to another district.

No longer appearing a carefully-groomed intellectual in a tailored suit, Gumilyov had clearly taken his brief stint in prison hard. His suit was already little more than black and white rags after the fall through his office window and the subsequent beating at the hands of Stalina's men. Did that bitch expect him to stand trial looking like this?\n\nEvery pair of eyes he passed turned to Gumilyov as he was half-dragged down the cold, dim concrete hallway. Rightist militiamen crowded into cells stood in silence, while their leftist neighbours jeered and shouted obscenities at the ragged man who had once been their most dangerous foe. \"Popular, aren't you?\" quipped the man holding Gumilyov's right arm. \"Sorry you aren't going to have an audience for the next event. We're keeping this a low-key affair. Probably more suitable for a man of your standing, don't you think?\"\n\nGumilyov didn't make a sound. Even without the gag wound tightly around his head, he wouldn't have dignified their chatter with a response. He just stared ahead into the gloom, closing off his ears to the din of the prisoners and guards all around him. Individual voices faded into an indistinct cacophony as he rounded a corner.\n\nAfter that moment, nobody ever saw Lev Gumilyov again - save for the guards who slit his throat, threw him into a shallow grave and riddled his prone form with bullets until their guns clicked empty."

The Republic NEEDS me - NEEDS the Party! Stalina will-\"\n\n\"Pipe down, dickhead,\" muttered one of his guards - which, Zhdanov couldn't tell. \"Now, uh...\" There was a sound of crinkling paper and a throat being cleared. \"Andrei... fuck, can't read this handwriting for shit.

In a corner, out of sight and out of mind, a truck was parked with a single wooden coffin in the flatbed. Everything else had been cleared away save for the post to which the traitor would be tied. The firing squad was silent, standing at ease yet visibly uncomfortable; they'd never shot a woman before.\n\nBukharina was led out of the cell block precisely on schedule, five minutes after the firing squad had arrived and been given time to prepare. It was best, the President had decided, for this particular operation to be carried out as quickly and cleanly as possible, given its nature. What made it distinct had not been elucidated to the warden, but he was an old servant of the law and was not given to questioning his orders.\n\nThe firing squad was brought to attention the moment Bukharina appeared. This, the warden understood the necessity of. Best not to let them be in an unprofessional mindset when the time came, unlike with the previous executions. This could be an unusually difficult task for them, given the woman's relative distance from the most extreme elements of her party.\n\nBukharina kept her eyes cast downwards as she was marched to the post and tied firmly in position. No prayer escaped her lips, and no unsurmountable terror set her to quivering.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" she murmured with a grim expression as the warden produced a blindfold from his pocket. Stowing the strip of soft fabric, he hesitated for a moment before producing a small silver flask and unscrewing the cap. He offered it to her with an expectant look, no malice in his eyes. Bukharina smiled sadly and nodded. The warden brought it to her lips, allowing her to enjoy a deep quaff - one last taste of home before the end.\n\nThe warden replaced his flask and stepped away. The first rays of sunlight crept over the prison walls. \"Firing squad!\" he shouted clearly in the cold morning air. \"Ready!\"\n\nThe men snapped to with drilled precision. The warden's voice echoed around the yard, bouncing off the stone walls. Bukharina inhaled, deeply and slowly.\n\n\"Take aim!\" She exhaled, feeling the weight of years flow out of her with her last breath. Uncertainty, fear and doubt left her mind. Only clarity remained - and the sense that she had always tried to do the right thing. Others would carry her torch. That was enough for her.\n\n\"Fire!\""

The compass is no help, either - half the damn compasses in Headquarters barely work anymore, and this one has given up the ghost ahead of schedule.\n\n\"Damn this stupid impromptu exercise,\" Sergeant Kuzmin snarls. Always a loyal follower, but never quite afraid to let his superiors know what he thinks. Leontiy doesn't reply, staring only at the mist. There are some boundaries it would be thoroughly inappropriate to cross. The sanctity of Command is one of them.\n\nAs he glares into the mist, something clicks. Those faint figures aren't trees - they must be the nearby hills. And if he can make out the hills, then - He scrabbles at his map, checking the faint contour lines. If he's lucky, he can get the shape of two landmarks down, like that one shaped a little like a loaf of bread, and the elongated ridge -\n\nLeontiy is a grown man of 37 years, and he's been in and out of barracks for his entire adult life. It takes all he has to keep himself from sobbing. He knows, for the first time in 8 hours, where he is going. His salary, and Kuzmin's, are safe.\n\nLeontiy and Kuzmin stumble into the finishing grounds five hours after that misty hill. They are among the three thousand commanders - of a total count of seven thousand and two hundred - who will survive without ejection from the Republican Army of Komi. But as the Army retools and rebuilds itself, it begins to look less like a rabble and more like a fighting force.

On all sides Ust-Sysolsk is embattled, and the armies grow ever closer in the black night, like a sheet, over the borders.\n\nIt grasps the hearts of senior citizens who watch the false-cheerfulness of the news and look into long-darkened closets, wondering if the old firearms are still working and if their aim is as sharp in their old age as it was at the first. So too the hearts of soldiers and generals, stifling their cheer and dulling the gleam of their boots. No one is willing to say what they really think, but all are looking to their old homes, and to reprieve in gentle obscurity. There is a time coming when they will no longer have the luxury of the former.\n\nThere is a cold silence, too, in the leadership. The options of the Republic have run dry. There is no one coming to save them, and what good is a government if it cannot look its people in the eye and tell them that things will, in due course, get better? The staffers, of course, are forbidden from even discussing such things. It scarcely matters. Just as ravens sense the coming of a storm, so too can the public sense the inexorable approach of a problem Komi can no longer deal with.\n\nIn a village to the south of Syktyvkar, children play the timeless games of all children everywhere: they run, aiming mock pistols and bows at each other, giggling as they hide behind walls and bushes. A mother, watching them, fingers the pistol in her own handbag.

They were her backup plan, her shadow government where the Assembly failed, and in that capacity they would serve an invaluable role.\n\nThe Friends Without. Old Grigachev here, a fighter for 20-odd years for his Miners' Syndicate against near odds, against the Government and against her own faction at times. A grizzled unionist, and one who had never had the benefit of despair. Invaluable. Police Commissioner Lvovich, a literal walking contradiction: he'd fought the Mayor of his city tooth and nail over expanded police budgets and unlimited civil emergency statutes, a committed man of peace in a Republic that found the latter increasingly outmoded.\n\nAnd there were the Enemies Within: her old contender Korolkov, the Leftist Without A Cause. She hadn't gone a month without some kind of sparring between his allies in the military and her own faction of the PSD, especially since the man was, by all accounts, incorruptible as he was stubborn. And who could forget the devil from her own party, the Loyal Oppositionist, Mizayov? She'd been one of the most terrifying debaters in the Party before Stalina had managed to integrate their ideals into a united force, in the early days - even now she was facing dogged resistance in the Legislative Branch for a controversial stance on the latest welfare bills, and coming out all the stronger for it.\n\nAs they stared in mutual confusion at the empty room, Stalina cleared her throat and rose to speak. The room fell silent before her. Men and women who'd fought harder than her for their ideals, and they would get the chance to fight for them one last time, against even herself.

Stalina kneaded her eyes, clutched at a useless coffee mug, and gazed at the dense script. Something in her felt deeply unbalanced, like a child playing on an endless swing whose hinges grew ever looser. Any moment she would fall off, and the game would be lost, and the long work would be lost with it. No, this was not the time for some idle nonsense! Only an objective examination of the facts would do. Rousing within herself the old strength she relied on, she stared at the current Bill.\n\nThe present draft would pass muster as it stood, she was sure. Increases in public security budgets and extraordinary provisions for law enforcement, investigations into public journalism outlets with suspicious sources, a crackdown on radical unionism: that was surely uncontroversial. And yet she wondered if she should make it lighter - perhaps only an investigation of formal socialist parties instead of a blanket attack on the unions? Yes, it seemed better to adopt a gentle touch.\n\nAnd yet it seemed woefully incomplete, almost vulnerable, in the space of an eye's blink. No, better to be harsh and stable than to regret leniency! Yes, a forced destruction of independent outlets here - and here - surely that would bring the Republic's radicals to its knees. Surely this would be enough.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet...

It wasn't like he didn't have the time, anyway - Voznesensky had sent him here, on this 'fact-finding mission', to scout out something he could present the Republic with shiny fetters and trimmed ribbons on the sides.\n\nHe shrugged. It was time to take his imagination for a walk.\n\nThe name of the factory had long been lost, and what appeared to have been a bomb-blast had sharded most of the walls in the east wing. Even so, there was plenty of evidence remaining to suggest that this place had once been a hive of activity: here and there the familiar white-scrabble of concrete and steel loomed in the building's innards, surrounded by brilliant rust-red rings of dust. Streaks of rust and scraped-off concrete indicated the presence of what must have been lights, equipment, presses and hydraulic wires.\n\nHow long had it been since the walls had hummed with activity, as they no doubt once had? When had the lights gone out, and how many had whiled away their youth playing soldier amidst the ruins? Rodionov thought to the interviews he'd held with the townsfolk in the little village to the left. So few of them left, and so many empty houses. Gone with the money, or its lack, and the hope leached from their faces like a blanket sodden too long in bleach. The years had been bleak to old Russia, and the wind harsh - and who could tell if it would continue?\n\nHis feet crunched on something, and he raised his boot away, squinting.

Even so, once the letter made it to Voznesensky there was little to do but apologise. It was an intrusion, after all, and no doubt the President would simply laugh it off or spend another afternoon on the phone, fulminating to Zhdanov or whoever had caught the man's eye these days.\n\nThe staffer unfortunate enough to chance upon Voznesensky later in the afternoon caught him at his worst: passionate, fiery, with a trace of the old vigor - dangerous in the way a lit match threatens the hand. Voznesensky seized the staffer by the arms, calling at once a staff meeting to address the miners' deplorable safety conditions and their degraded working hours. The meeting lasted five hours, and their response-plan five more: the rays of dawn heralded the end of the latter.\n\nThe President, however, was bound by no such petty rules as the need to sleep. By dawn he had chauffeured a handy staff-car, dragging his aides along to 'speak' directly with the management of that little mine southwest of Syktyvkar, and whatever he told the Company men, it worked. The headlines blared the President's name and a handy little picture of a smiling Voznesensky held aloft by exultant sweaty men for a week straight, declaring him a MAN OF THE PEOPLE and a PROGRESSIVE ICON.\n\nTo the exhausted Staffers planning his celebratory campaign, half-dead from overwork and on unpaid overtime, it almost seemed worth the trouble."

From factories and workshops, Russian and foreign the goods flowed, to city shops, town squares and village markets and a public eager to purchase them. And from citizen to citizen, to the benefit of all, was provided the basic needs of life. The country could only be great if it was good for all, only strong if it protected the weak.\n\nThere is much still left to do, and the road will be long and hard, but what we have suffered to come here will drive us onward. Our achievements will spur us to reach new heights. We will continue our march, together!"

Exhaustive in nature, they have been instantiated at every level of governmental administration, and reforms range from examinations of school density distributions, to the development of standardized testing measures, and more besides.\n\nHowever, perhaps the greatest achievement of the state in this regard has been the general agreement by all concerned parties that the quality of available education has sharply increased. Strenuous qualification standards, the focused attraction and repatriation of exiled and expatriate academics, and the provision of proper funding and equipment for scientific purposes, have all contributed to this.\n\nAlthough the level of the Republic's available academic offerings does not yet begin to approach that of more established localses, such as the Reich, the Sphere, or the United States, the gap is quickly closing. This is being recognized.\n\nAnd also, quite rightly, being attributed to the SMR."

Valery promised himself that once this was all over, he would take some time out of his schedule to speak some very deliberate words to the visual designer.\n\nWell, it wasn't like the logo was important. Taking his placard, Valery began the twenty-minute trek to his appointed District. He had at least gotten lucky with the placing: he'd heard some volunteers would have to stay overnight thanks to the travel time back and forth. As he arrived in the little park-square, he set up his placard next to a couple of chairs with a sign hung between lamp-lights: A CONVERSATION ABOUT DEMOCRACY! ALL WELCOME!\n\nThe first to approach the improvised booth he'd set up was a pensioner, a lady in her sixties clutching a handbag. Valery helped her into the seat opposite his as she snarled at him. \"Get out of my district, reactionary. This place isn't for your type and it never will be.\"\n\nValery simply smiled, drawing his secret weapon from his bag: a flask of tea, chilled and thoroughly stirred. \"Reactionary? That's an interesting word to use, madam. I'd like to hear more about what you have to say about us - and if I'm not wrong, you stay on Petrov Street, don't you? Our representatives have never been to the area...\"\n\nThe afternoon wore on, clouds scudding and fading across the patterned bands of the horizon. Valery danced with words, taking the lady on a tour of democratic ideals, PSD's manifesto and policymaking, and the agenda of Unionism. By the time the lady left, her head was full of strange new thoughts and something even stranger. A sympathy to democracy.\n\nAs Valery made a satisfied note on his log, he wrote the lady's name in red, with a star next to it."

Either way, we believe the many agencies we've collaborated with deserve rich praise for their conduct during this campaign, and the near 60-percent increase in voting registrations rests in no small part on their many shoulders. Special thanks go to the Mitvol family, whose invaluable help in setting up our conversational tea-booths boosted our public image immensely.

Always a hot topic, that one.\n\nEither way, even if the years had not been kind to his little band, he was loathe to hand it over to any upstart from the nearest yokel-establishment of a political coalition coming his way. Yes, he'd had his differences with Ivana, and yes, he'd come to blows with the Neo-Stolypinists in his ranks more times than he had fingers, but he'd kept the Party together even as so many had lost faith in his direction - if he stopped now, what would it mean for his life's work?\n\nThat was what Yahontov told Stalina, over a cup of hot tea at one of the less run-down cafes in this part of the Capital. Staring at her piercing eyes, Yahontov sensed a hunter, and his instinctive urge to back away grew in his throat.

He was an entertaining spectacle to be sure, but for the rest of the young people in Syktyvkar, nothing more.\n\n\"I just think that old fool needs some help is all.

Russia, they rightly argued, was neither wholly European or Asian. Beneath her shattered banner lived many races; Buryats, Kazakhs, Tatars, Bashkirs. Each had unique customs, and a distinct identity. Trying to force them all into some unitary \"Russian\" identity, as their forebears had done, would only lead to resentment, and in the case of uniting Russia, popular resistance was an untenable prospect.\n\nOn the right were her comrades of sort, advocating the exact opposite. The task before Russia was grand; uniting a broken and disparate people against a teutonic invader. There would be no room for bickering in the unification struggle to come. The peoples of Russia had for centuries shared an identity, regardless of ethnicity, and could only restore themselves behind such a common name.\n\nUltimately, she did not feel strongly either way. This was a theoretical issue, something to be resolved when they had the luxury to do so. Much more pressing was rebuilding an economy, guarding against foreign threats, establishing control over newly acquired territories.\n\nYet still, she knew the inflammatory debate that had conspired to bring this proposal to her desk. It was the right wing that held most sway, and it was the right wing that kept her in power. In the interest of the Free Russian Republic to come, many compromises would have to be made.\n\nBegrudgingly, she signed off on the right wing's proposal, authorising their blatant attempt to shape the Russian future in their image.

One leftist proposed the opening address to be towards \"Those who reside within our controlled area of Russia\". That contrasted with one man on the right who declared that she should address her speech to \"The most loyal Russians of the Empire\". It went on like that, paragraphs and pages on what some thought her first words should be. That didn't even brush upon the rest of the \"critique\" she was given. Some believed, on both sides, that how deep her voice was held the utmost importance. One concerned educator wrote in frantic pace about how speaking deep-voice would seem \"Imperialistic\". A miner who had learned their letters just to write to her pleaded in scrawled Russian that she acted \"as a man\".\n\nStalina, having wasted her night, tossed the pile to the waste basket.

Stalina would have dismissed them as any other Soviet warlord, except that these communists idolized Joseph Stalin, Stalina's father.\n\nAccording to Kaganovich, \"Stalinism\" consisted of an exceptionally hardline interpretation of communist ideology, with highly-centralized power and a focus on mass-industrialization.

And he had a job to do.\n\nHis fingers trembled as he struggled to write everything down: the two animated figures certainly didn't seem terribly concerned about their scribe, talking in a constant, uninterrupted flow of dialogue. Damn this job! He knew the two were friends - the way they were at ease with each other, it was hard not to see them as the two nerdy children in every schoolroom - but did they really have to speak this much on official business?\n\nStalina paused, her face momentarily darkening, and Brukhonekov murmured a silent prayer as he finished the last notes on their conversation. A discussion on democratic reversion, the usual talk of military loyalty - nothing beyond the ordinary. But if he knew Stalina, her pause meant she was moving to the real meat of the conversation.\n\n\"Petro, you are of course aware of why I am here. My apologies for being indirect - you know I hate being curt with friends - \" Stalina took a sip of her tea. \"Officers like you, they don't come freely these days. I want to know if your men can stomach my next orders, because if they can't, well, our State will never be brought to proper health.\" Another sip, like a pause in a music-sheet. \"Can I have that confidence?\"\n\nGeneral Grigorenko, the acting head of the Army, looked for a moment like his proper age - and then the smile was back, barely even dimmed. \"I have nothing but trust in my men. Even if they do not agree with your orders, Svetlana - Ms President - they will follow mine. And that means they will follow you.\" If there was doubt in his voice, he hid it very, very well."

 komi_recgov_regional.4.t: "A Recruitment Talk"
 komi_recgov_regional.4.d: "The Army came into the little town with sound and fury: on the backs of khaki-painted lorries men and women shouted into microphones, yelling at the befuddled residents and heaving pamphlets in the air. They crossed each street once or twice, leaving a trail of paper behind them, and then they left for the town centre. Noises and the echo of audiovisual equipment could be heard through noon, as residents hid in their beds and snapped obscenities at the menace. For the men and women who bothered looking at the leaflets, not much awaited them - four words, SCREENING AT TOWN CENTRE, were the only words of substance on the thin little paper-rolls.\n\nTowards noon the gathering began. Soldiers walked door to door, escorting smiling men in suits who styled themselves 'recruiters' - they sought the young men first, those who looked capable of military service but with no occupation. Then they asked for the old men, then the working-women: it appeared no part of the town was safe from their ungentle queries. Men and women were herded towards the town-square, the gaze of the soldiers around them a prod for their movements, and into an involuntary movie-theater.\n\nAs the patriotic movie was broadcast on the side of a residential building, recruiters moved amongst the ranks, reminding the gathered of their responsibilities. Their faith, their God, their families - all needed defending. All needed to be preserved. And who would go, they whispered, if not them? All that was needed would be a signature, only a signature, to help keep the Rodina safe.\n\nIf there was any doubt in the minds of those with different convictions, it was dispelled as soldiers formed barriers between the audience and the outside world. Here, in this small town, the Army would take everything - and there would be no resistance."

 komi_recgov_regional.5.t: "The National Sovereignty Act"
 komi_recgov_regional.5.d: "President Stalina looked down once more at the bill which lay on her desk, the lines on its cover sheet unmarred and blank. Its title was unassuming - a bureaucratic euphemism, typical of laws passed by the National Assembly, in the age of the newly unified Western Russia. The National Sovereignty Act - the culmination of weeks of research, drafting, and committee votes, and the greatest stride yet towards achieving the Sovereign Democratic Party's agenda of a strong, independent Russia.\n\nWithin it was everything that she had advocated for, on the campaign trail, regarding the threat of foreign imperialism and dependency. Limits on trade performed without defensive obligations, limits on debt, an increased import duty... all of it would serve towards the ultimate cause, the cause of a Russia free from threat both external and internal. A Russia which would be seen by the world as an equal power in its own right, a Russia which one day could stand alongside the United States itself as a bastion of democracy and stability.\n\nShe looked up, once more, nodding to the cameras which clustered around her desk, littered with papers. Her silver pen glided across the paper, leaving her signature on the line marked \"APPROVED\". The reporters clapped politely, but her focus was elsewhere, out the window. Far away, she imagined, in every city and town of Russia, every mansion, apartment, or rural hut, the people of the Republic now lived in a world that had just become a little bit safer for Russia."

 komi_recgov_regional.6.d: "The last independent legislators of the Republic kept at their business like sheepdogs, running loyally in circles even as the herd grew ever sparser and the night descended overhead. Sheepdogs, Stalina mouthed at them as they spoke. Blind little men who were too damn headstrong to know which way the wind was blowing. How had she worked with them for so long without tiring of the effort?\n\nPresently they were speaking regarding the latest Political Reservation measures, measures she'd put in place to ensure the safety of the State. These idiots were playing the audience like a fiddle, speaking of the dangers of \"overreach\" - they didn't have the good sense to see the threats only the President could ever see. Was this how that fool Voznesensky had felt?\n\nGod, she couldn't believe the nerve of these people. At least her Party men had the good sense to remain silent. Well, this latest bill would shut up the yapping once and for all. Hiding her growing irritance she waved for the Speaker to admit her name to the list.\n\nSavouring the looks on the legislators' faces as she did so, Stalina spoke in what seemed almost like glee: \"Under the auspices of the Executive Directive Act, I declare the Political Reservation Measures under discussion today a matter of National Security. Discussion of this topic is hereby curtailed; now, if I could invite the audience to examine page 63 of our latest Economic Budget...\"\n\nWatching the sheepdogs storm out of the Chamber, Stalina felt something churn in her stomach. Something primal stirred within her, deep and angry and wanting to break things, and she felt the bars of her mind clanging with the thing's attempts to break free."

President Stalina was smiling at him, as were her Advisors - and were those generals hanging to her flanks? There was a letter on her desk, neatly folded and pressed with the stamp of the Republic's highest office.\n\nYahontov had the sudden urge to run. Something very bad was about to happen, and he could feel it creating upon him with no way of pushing back.\n\nStalina gestured in a grand, flowing movement. \"Yahontov, please! Have a seat. It's a pleasure to meet you after all this time.\" Nikolai sat gingerly at the table, not daring even to look at the proffered teacup. \"Do you know why you are here, Nikolai?\"\n\n\"My - my party, Madame President. The Russian Democratic All-Union League. Please, Madame - we have never insulted anyone of importance, not after Morozov, anyway.\"\n\n\"At ease, Yahontov. We are here to congratulate you for your service to the Republic, and your honest conviction in bettering its people.\" Yahontov could scarcely blush before Stalina struck a final blow. \"And we are here to commemorate the end of that service. From today, the noble burdens of struggle will be lifted from your party, and you will be allowed to celebrate in the perfect Republic we have created. It will be dissolved, as are all unnecessary instruments.\"\n\nYahontov stared, the life seeping from his eyes, as Stalina raised her cup, raw triumph shining from her own. \"Please, Nikolai. Have a cup - this drink is very expensive. Wouldn't want it to go to waste.\""

 komi_recgov_regional.8.t: "A Controlled Schism"
 komi_recgov_regional.8.d: "Morozov's little clique had dwindled with the recent shifts in the Republic's political atmosphere. Everyone could tell that the merger - well, the devouring, to put it truthfully - of the SMR had negated its political value entirely, and no one expected the Party of Steel to yield to a bunch of refugees on any policy of substance. Even so, there remained the tiny, dubious hope of being allowed to speak freely on intra-party policy. It was a mere sliver of political concessions, but that was all that could be afforded.\n\nMost had simply lost hope, in part yielding to the new circumstances, in part simply tiring of it all. Morozov lost friends, one by one, in the trickle back to the provinces and villages. One last act of protest. Morozov was left to wonder if anything would survive of Morozov's brainchild - in theory or practice - when the reign of the PSD came to an end. Assuming, of course, it came to an end at all.\n\nMorozov preferred not to think along those lines. Perhaps the residual unease was why receiving the news of the new Democratisation Order gave him such a wild joy - the President had been explicit in her orders, and he looked forward to retrieving his old membership rolls. A new beginning was here for his movement.\n\nAs he looked on, however, darkness once again clouded his vision: for it appeared that someone had gone through his membership records with a sharp eye and a sharper knife. Members, here and there, had been lost - the Party's best and brightest - and Stalina had been very, very explicit about not seeking out members beyond the records. It appeared that Morozov's free party was in fact free only to form a party: everything else was up for debate."

 komi_recgov_regional.9.d: "Excerpt from National Assembly Speech, \"On The Necessity of Political Centralism\", 19XX-XX-XX\n\n\"Friends. We have spoken much in the previous session regarding the present freedoms of our political system. I know many of you are privately questioning the meaning of my words: how can it be, you say, that while the PSD holds a ironclad majority here other parties can be free to act? Is this not the definition of a soft autocracy? Let me correct these misguided beliefs.\"\n\n\"These parties are not constrained by their small size - indeed, by preventing overspill of dedicated Opposition candidates whose only purpose is to cause trouble for us, they will be free to act as policy guidance bodies for the body politic: we are similarly free to follow their advice when it is best for the country, as befits our status as the dominant political entity. We are to act as older brothers, too: always nurturing to our lessers and juniors, while retaining the endless patience necessary to teach them to be better.\"\n\n\"But when it comes down to it - when it is time to really get this country going - the elder brother must take the steering wheel, and he cannot afford any distractions. This is the real freedom of the dominance of the PSD: that while the SMR and the DSNP will be free to speak, they will never suffer the burdens of actual leadership. Only the PSD can bear this burden, and we will do so without question, until Russia is safe, and our long battle will end.\""

 komi_recgov_regional.14.t: "One Last Look Back"
 komi_recgov_regional.14.d: "Stalina watched the sun set over her little corner of the Republic. The streets glowed, a neon shimmer washing over the shopfronts. Couples paced, giggling as they did so, down the broadwalks of the city centre, and to their flanks the city came to cautious life. Here and there a busker played their repertoire to all who would listen, drawing in curious crowds and the occasional tourist. If there were signs of protest, they were certainly well hidden (although the recent Public Security Act was very comprehensive, it was not supernatural).\n\nShe felt tired, hollowed out, even. The preceding months had taken their toll on her sleep schedule, and she'd been through so many arguments with her closest staff that she sometimes felt ashamed to greet them in the morning. It felt like a vast abyss separated her from the old Stalina, the committed Democrat, the speech-writer and rabble-rouser. Would her past self even like the person she had become?\n\nStalina sighed. Perhaps this was how her father had felt in the last years of his life. Withdrawn and burnt out by the endless contention for power - it was no wonder the old Steel had rusted and broken, and with what to show for it? A footnote in the history books, and a milquetoast reference to extremism. Well, she'd done her best to follow in his best impression - and she'd succeeded. Her work in the Republic was safe for the time being, from enemies without and within.\n\nPerhaps this was another story she would tell herself as age descended, and perhaps she would stop believing in it altogether one day. For now, what she had built would suffice. She reached to the telephone to call Morozov. Even if the Republic disdained her, her friends - and her brandy - would not."
 komi_recgov_regional.14.a: "Perhaps it was for the best."
 komi_recgov_regional.15.t: "No More Easy Bargains"
 komi_recgov_regional.15.d: "Stalina growled at her advisors fairly often - it was all to be expected from one who took pride in her name as the Lady of Steel. Usually this took the form of mild snarls and accusations of incompetence, which was comparatively mild for the Republic's politics. It was of little consequence to the advisors, and after she calmed down she was usually more amenable to discussion, even if she remained reluctant to change her views on anything. Anger was common, and easy to deal with.\n\nThis preternatural calm, however, was not. Stalina looked at the senior staff of the Economic Bureau, calm, unsmiling and totally implacable. \"No, I will not. That is the end of the matter. I will not reconsider the signing of the Sovereignty Act under any circumstances.\" She flipped open a dossier, looking through its contents as if her staff were simply not there.\n\nOne of the advisors, a mid-level bureaucrat, made the mistake of speaking his thoughts. \"President Stalina, with all due respect, the Act will cripple our economic will and devour our private industry. I have been on the phone with worried corporate clients all week.\"\n\nInstantly her gaze, as scorching as the sun and far less measured in its touch, was upon him. \"With all due respect, I care not a whit for you or the corporate suits. My job and my heart lie with this country, and if we are to sell its treasure to those who cannot be trusted with it we may as well disband the Army and lower our banners tomorrow.\"\n\nShe turned to her papers with a rare vehemence. \"You are forgiven the little transgression of your ignorance. Speak against me again and I will ensure even that privilege is stripped from you. Now leave.\""

 RUS_niki.1.d: "Captain Nikita Preobrazhensky frowned slightly as he looked at the position of the cat in the tree, and then back to the woman who had ambushed him during his time off. The creature had wedged itself firmly in a fork between the trunk and a thick branch, partially hidden by some leaves. It was a large, fluffy cat, barely tamed, staring down at both of them with the arrogant superiority that only a honed stealth predator could muster.\n\n\"Vanya?\", the woman cried out once more, prompting precisely no reaction except for another retreat on the animal's part.\n\nNikita placed a gloved hand on the bark. He couldn't help but think that this was hardly an emergency - certainly nothing to pull him from his morning route for - but it was a diversion from his morning raspberry vatrushka routine. With a small sound of exertion, he scaled the first three branches, nimbly flattening himself against the trunk to keep himself steady.\n\nHe heard a voice from behind him. \"You're close - just one up!\"\n\nHe turned his head over his shoulder to respond. \"I see, yes... just a moment, comrade.\"\n\nHe reached out to the cat, letting it sniff at his glove. His bag hung open over his shoulder. He wrapped an arm around the trunk before hauling himself up again, level with the cat, and presented the bag. It looked at him suspiciously, and let out the precursor of a hiss. A branch tickled Nikita's cheek as he tried to look inviting.\n\n\"...shhhh,\" he said to the cat. \"You will get hungry eventually, and best to do that where there is food, yes?\"\n\nIf the cat understood him, it left no indication, simply continuing to stare with yellow eyes. Nikita let out a resigned sound and placed the bag's handle in his mouth. With his now-free hand, he reached around the cat and shoved it, causing the startled creature to flop right into his pack. Ignoring the terrifying sounds coming from within and the emergent toothache, he hurriedly slung the bag back over his shoulder and descended. He did his best to look carefully stoic as he placed the pack on the ground and the cat leapt out.\n\n\"Vanya!\" she said, as the cat weaved between her legs. \"Thank you- would you like some water, Captain?\" she offered, \"It must be difficult work.\" Her eyes flicked to the door of the nearby apartment building. Nikita couldn't help but give a wry smile back, before responding."

 KOM.366.d: "Even in our most turbulent and uncertain times, it is unlikely that someone could imagine that Syktyvkar, a mid-sized city at the entrance to the rear of Russia, could become a centre of the Russian Republican statehood and a small, if shining, gleam in the devastated country. Surviving its troubled transition to democracy and the attacks from radicals of all sides, Syktyvkar provided itself a special spot in the Russian history.\n\nAs some political workers of the Republic developed sentimentality towards the city with which they went through the hardest challenges in their lives, it is time to admit, however, that in the light of our current strategy, Syktyvkar no longer fits as a centre of the democratic Russian advancement. It is too far from the core of communications in West Russia, and too close to hostile forces.\n\nIt has therefore been proposed to move the capital to Vyatka, the former residence of the short-lived rule of the self-proclaimed Emperor, in order to address these issues. However, many within the government hold that the capital should, despite all of the known problems, remain in Syktyvkar. This is both for reasons of administrative continuity as well as to honor its new history, and to further cement the unique identity of our nation.\n\nBoth options have merit. It is however, in the end, the President's decision whether to move the seat of government or not."
