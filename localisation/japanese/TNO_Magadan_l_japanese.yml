 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_DESC: "あらゆる点で、ミハイル・アレクセーエヴィチ・マトコフスキーのロシア・ファシズムは、ロザエフスキーのそれとは対照的である。ロザエフスキーは教条主義的である一方、彼は実用主義的であり、ロザエフスキーが巧みで激烈な演説家である一方、彼は交渉人なのであって、機転と政治的洞察力をもって、思慮深く敵対者を揺さぶることに優れている。ロザエフスキーが反ユダヤ主義を黒シャツ隊を率いて煽動する一方、マトコフスキーはそのような行為を軽蔑した。だがある時点において、彼らの目標は一致した。この協働によりロシア・ファシスト党の党員数はピークに達し、ロシア系亡命者にとってファシズムは魅力あるものになっていった。\n\n大祖国戦争が勃発すると、ドイツ人がロシア人を絶滅させるために戦いを起こしたことについて、両者の違いは明確になった。ヒトラーの破壊や計画的虐殺行為にもかかわらず、ロザエフスキーはボリシェヴィズムからロシアを救われんことを夢見て、ヒトラーの支持を求めたのである。マトコフスキーはそんな幻想を抱いてはいなかった。ドイツのソビエト連邦への宣戦は、ロシアに対する宣戦であり、ロシア人への人種的憎悪をむき出しにしたものにすぎないのである。ロシア・ファシスト党は懸命にアピールしたものの、結局のところナチスはロシアの独立など微塵も考えはしなかった。とはいえ、マトコフスキーの機転により、彼と彼の派閥は静かに時を待ち、着実に勢力を得ていった。\n\nそしてその時が来た。彼らはロザエフスキーからマガダンを奪い、体制支持者を追い出し党の分断を公式としたのである。領地を得たことにより、マトコフスキーはロシアを荒廃から救う道を今こそ追い求める事ができる。そのための手段は日本を飛び越えた大海の先－－アメリカにある。だが、マトコフスキーがどれほど熟達した交渉人といえども、外国人を説得することは困難な仕事だが……彼は自らの能力を信じ続けるであろう。"
 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_PETLIN_DESC: "ロシアファシスト党の他の幹部とは異なり、ニコライ・ニコラエヴィチ・ペトリンは、移民ではなくハルビンの出身だった。この違いは、最初は表面的なものに過ぎなかったようだ。ハルビンで劇作家、作曲家、作家として活躍していたペトリンは、ロシア・ファシスト党に入党し、政治的組織人としての才能を発揮した。やがて、ファシストの青年組織の指導者となり、最終的にはコンスタンティン・ロザエフスキーのロシア・ファシスト最高評議会の一員となったが、マトコフスキーやロザエフスキーという個性的な人物に囲まれて臆病になっていた。\n\nドイツ軍がロシアに侵攻した時、ペトリンはロザエフスキーがナチスの侵攻を支持したことを非難し、抗議して辞職した。以後、ペトリンはファシスト党のマトコフスキー派に移り、彼の個人秘書を務めることになった。この関係は、マトコフスキーが党内のロザエフスキー派を分離するまで続いた。ペトリンは再び出世し、前ロシア人ヴォシチは分裂の際に彼を副官に任命した。ペトリンの下で、ファシスト党は改革を約束してアメリカに働きかけるという課題を追求したが、マトコフスキーはこの約束を何度も覆した。\n\nロシア・ファシスト党がロシア民族労働党になったとき、ペトリンはその場にいた。彼らがシベリアを征服し、イルクーツクやヤクーツクの街を行進した時もそこにいた。ダルストロイの罪でマトコフスキーが辞任し、逮捕された時も、彼はその場にいた。今度こそロシアに民主主義が戻ってきたときには、移民たちの指導のもと、その場に立ち会うとペトリンは誓う。彼の運命は、ハルビンの救済である。"

 MAG_gateway_into_russia: "ロシアの玄関"
 MAG_gateway_into_russia_desc: "成り行きに任せたわけではない。ヴォシチが闘争を開始するためにマガダンを選んだことは深慮に基づいていたことだったのである。この凍てつく太平洋の港は多くの神の恵みをもたらす。カムチャッカやアラスカなどからの密輸船は常に多大な恩恵をこの街に伝えてくれるというわけだ。ヴォシチの政府はこの富を活かし、我らの正統性を高めていくであろう。"

 MAG_building_the_wastes: "荒野での建設"
 MAG_building_the_wastes_desc: "恐怖のニュースが西から流れてくる。ドイツ軍の爆撃テロ、盗賊の襲撃、ロシア人によるロシア人への戦争……ロシア極東の端に位置するマガダンは、祖国の他の地域を悩ます問題から守られた遠隔地である。しかし、その遠さゆえに、マガダンは大したことがない。人口、資源ともにロシアで最も少ない地域であり、最終的なロシアの解放と再統一のために役立つものはあまりない。\n\nマトコフスキーはそれを変えるだろう。彼の党の幹部は、マガダンの通りや郊外を回って、彼の聖戦に参加してくれる労働者を探す。彼らは道路や電柱、小さな作業場や工場を建設する。赤軍の失敗とドイツ軍の犯罪で闇に覆われたロシアの体に解放の日が訪れたとき、彼らはその義務と献身によって豊かに報われるだろう。"
 MAG_siberian_factories: "シベリアの工場"
 MAG_siberian_factories_desc: "マガダンは、これまで述べてきたように、ロシアの他の地域から離れて孤立している。マガダンの港町自体、存在する産業は小さく、特に軍需品の生産に適したものではない。幸いなことに、極東では、赤軍の時代に開発された工業の中心地ウラジオストクが日本軍や満洲軍に奪われているように、このような産業の不足はどこでも続いている。簡潔に言えば、我々が東洋で戦う相手は皆、同じ土俵に立っている。\n\nしかしマトコフスキーはチャンスを逃さない。シベリアの荒れ地から、子供たちの小さな争いをするためではなく、戦争をするための、明確な目的を持った工場を作る。党は、マガダンの兵士を、崇高な理想を持つ山賊としてではなく、兵士として武装させ、訓練する。また、党の翼の下に保護されている国民は、貧困や欠乏を知ることはない。これを模範とし、来るべきロシアの将来としよう。"
 MAG_siberian_farms: "シベリアの農場"
 MAG_siberian_farms_desc: "中国の有名な戦略家がかつて言ったように、「軍隊は足で動くのではなく、胃で動く」のだ。呪われた連邦と帝国の時代、常にマガダンの港町は食料需要を支えるために外部からの輸入に頼ってきた。祖国の他の地域とのつながりが奪われてしまった間、住民の多くは沿岸漁業で生計を立ててきた。彼らの胸には、飢えから生まれた「ロシアに救われたい」という密かな願いが広がっていた。\n\n党は、そしてマトコフスキーは、その呼びかけに応じなければならない。役人は志願兵や徴兵兵を集め、シベリアの畑で働かせるだろう。極東は肥沃ではない、だが、誠実なロシア人の努力で奇跡が起きるだろう。倉から溢れるほどの食料は必要ない。シベリアの厳しい気候を生き抜けて、民衆を養うだけの量があればよいのだ。ロシアが再び立ち上がるとき、これらの苦難は風に舞う灰のように忘れ去られることだろう。"
 MAG_try_something_else: "何か他のことを試す"
 MAG_try_something_else_desc: "シベリア工場や農場の設立により、マガダンの党は行動と改革ができる有能な勢力ということが実証された。残念ながら、これらの行為は今のところ限られた成功しか収めていない。マトコフスキーとその政治派閥にとっては認めがたいことではあるが、これらの努力が有効であったかどうかは時間が経たないと分からないので、今は待つしかない。一方、党の武力の問題がある。有能で武装も比較的充実しているとはいえ、我が党の兵士は極北での戦闘には向いていないし、慣れてもいない。\n\nそろそろ別のことをやってみるべきだ。マトコフスキーもかつて軍人であった。将官や士官たちが、シベリアの荒れた天候の中でも戦えるよう鍛え抜かれた経験豊かな兵士たちによる新しい軍隊を作り上げるのをマトコフスキーは見守るだろう。訓練は、厳しい環境であろうと晴天であろうと定期的に行われる。マガダンの兵士は皆、マトコフスキーの聖戦の先鋒となるのだ。"
 MAG_acquire_advisors: "助言者を得る"

 MAG_radical_techniques: "急進的手法"
 MAG_radical_techniques_desc: "極東は荒涼とした大地である。連邦、帝国時代にも人がまばらに住んでいたが、ロシアの東方拡大を支える文明がないため、生活は困難で容赦のないものになっている。シベリアの森とツンドラでは、戦争は西側のような性格を帯びることはない。北方には大したインフラもなく、戦争は極東の支配をめぐる小国同士の小競り合い程度で終わっている。シベリアで勝つということは、ヨーロッパで教えられているような戦争の一般的な教訓を捨てるということだ。\n\n大義のために、我々の知っていることはすべて捨て去らなければならない。つまり戦争の方法は時代に合わせて変化するのだ。我らが軍の兵士は、シベリアの原住民から学んだ教訓に基づき、急進的で新しい訓練方式を受けることになる。やがてシベリアの森やツンドラも、我々にとっては西ロシアの平野のようになり、敵がロザエフスキーであれ、ツァーリ派であれ、赤軍であれ、我々を攻撃することを止める障害はなくなるだろう。"

 MAG_winterized_gear: "防寒装備"

 MAG_smuggling_routes_desc: "ツァーリ・ミハイルの国家と互恵関係に到達するための最大の課題は、どうやって彼らの土地の到達するのかという問題に対する答えを見つけることだったが、我々はその解決策を編み出した。\n\nここ極東では、集落やその間の繋がりが少なくまばらであることはよく知られた事実である。つまり、注意深く経路やスケジュールを精査すれば、実は秘密の手段でチタと繋がることが可能なルート、あるいはそのいくつものを作ることが可能なのである。これらのルートは我々の最高の兵士によって守られ、武器や資源が行き交うことができ、さらには我々の国家間の使者の輸送も可能になる。チタとの間に何でも密輸できるようになれば、地理的な問題を克服し、外交関係を確立するための良い第一歩となる。"

 MAG_call_the_party_congress_desc: "我が国が成長し進化するにつれ、その政治制度や統治手段も成長し進化していかなければならない。党大会が召集され、新たに創設されたロシア国民労働党（旧ロシア・ファシスト党）は、我が国の政治体制にどのような改革と変革が必要であるかを決定することになるのである。\n\nヴォシチはより安定的で機能的な国家を確保するために自らの理想に近づける意向を示している。このことを考慮に入れて、政府を改善するよう努めなければならない。"

 MAG_a_federalist_model_desc: "ロシアのような広大な国土をどのように統治するかを議論するとき、連邦制モデルを考慮しないのは注意力に欠けていると言えよう。連邦制の利点は数多くある。例えば、個々の州や地域が連邦政府からある程度の自治権や独立性を持つことで、それぞれの地域に応じた政策が可能になる。\n\n加えて、このシステムは国民の政治参加を促し、国政全般における負担を軽減することができる。ヴォシチの力は弱まるかもしれないが、その分、ヴォシチの統治を安定させることができるかもしれない。"

 MAG_reform_the_blackshirts: "黒シャツ隊の改革"
 MAG_reform_the_blackshirts_desc: "黒シャツ隊は全国的に凶悪な暴力集団として広く非難を集め、その廃止を求める声も少なくない。ヴォシチはそのような急進的措置に決して同意はしないだろう。しかし、黒シャツ隊を別の組織に作り変えることなら賛成してくれるかもしれない。彼らは多くの人的資源を有し、暴力の執行と取り扱いの経験があり、まともな採用基準を持ち、全国に事務所と拠点を構えている。\n\nその答えは明確だ。黒シャツ隊を警察組織に改編すればいいのだ。指導部と活動基準を少し調整すれば、数週間以内に合法的で有能な警察部隊による国家の警備を始められるだろう。"
 MAG_expand_on_the_bill: "章典を拡大"
 MAG_expand_on_the_bill_desc: "数年前、ペトリンはアメリカの援助を訴えるために、「シベリア権利章典」を書き上げた。マトコフスキーは我が国と政党の指導者であることから、この章典を自分の手柄にし、ヴォシチの政権に大きな影響を与えないようにできるだけ多くの調整を加えることにこだわった。\n\n我がヴォシチは国家のため、非常に多くのことをやってくれているが、ペトリンの政治工作で章典を改善させ、抜け穴をなくすのが一番いいのかもしれない。マトコフスキーの知らないことが彼を苦しめることはない。"

 MAG_subsidize_radio_free_magadan_desc: "数年前、マガダン自由放送は全国民のためにライブショーやニュース速報を放送していた。しかし、時代が厳しくなるにつれて政府はそのサービスを維持することができなくなった。政府資金を消耗するだけでなく、当時のマガダンではほとんどの人がラジオを所有していなかったため、実用性が乏しいと判断されたのだ。\n\n今は時代が変わった。そしてマガダンは昔よりさらに豊かになった。ラジオを持つ人も増え、政府にもお金が入るようになった。放送サービスを再開することは我々にとって有益なことかもしれない、より厳密な政府の管理下に置いた状態の下で、という条件付きだが。"

 MAG_the_all_russian_council_of_corporations_desc: "全ロシア企業評議会という新しい産業界の評議会が設立される予定だ。この協議会は政府の政策に助言し、意見を述べ、経済全体に利益をもたらすような方向へ政策を導く手助けをする。これら団体の評議員は特定の産業に従事する企業や法人の連合体から選出されることになっている。\n\n例えば、鉱業にはその代表者を持っており、製造業や通信業もそれに同じだ。願わくば、このような組織が国家の富を向上させ、ロシアを再び繁栄への道へと導くためにのみ役立たんことを。"

 MAG_form_the_recovery_commission_desc: "近年、農業生産と貿易港の確保により我らの経済は異例と言っていいほど好調だが、近年の激しい戦闘によるダメージはまだ大きく残っている。\n\n復興支援のため、新たに「復興委員会」を設置した。この委員会は現在進行中の全地方および国家の復興プロジェクトを監督し、政府資源の流れの調整を開始する予定だ。この調整により、復旧にかかる時間が短縮され、必要な物資がより効率的に割り当てられることを期待される。"
 MAG_import_machinery: "機械類を輸入"
 MAG_import_machinery_desc: "ロシアの国家産業はかなり貧弱である。旧ソ連時代の産業プロジェクトの残骸であり、内訳は何十年も前のものがほとんどであるだけでなく、長年使っているうちにほとんどボロボロになってしまっている。それだけでなく、古くて効率の悪い設備が製品の価格を高くさせ、競争力を低下させているのだ。\n\nロシアの製造業を活性化し、輸出品をより魅力的なものにするためには我々の機材を世界の標準に近づけることが必要だ。アメリカには適切な価格で一流の機材を提供することをとても望んでいるいくつかの取引先がおり、彼らは我々に接触を図ってきている。"
 MAG_the_laborers_due: "労働者の権利"
 MAG_the_laborers_due_desc: "我が国の工場は日夜、強欲な資本家や企業家のために材料や商品を供給している。我らの国民労働者は日々、膨大な仕事量に押しつぶされながら毎日働いている。それでも、長い一日の仕事と短い夜の休みの後、彼らが手にするのは企業が出す最低限の給与、時には1ドル数セントにも満たない時給である。\n\n少ない給料で一生懸命働くのは腹立たしいことであり、下層階級はそう思っているようだ。気をつけないとカリスマ的なポピュリストや共産主義者の喧伝するそのイデオロギーに救いを求め、その影響下に置かれる可能性すらある。それを防ぐと同時に国の安定を図るには労働者の生活環境を改善すること、まず給料から改善すべきだろう。"
 MAG_free_enterprise: "自由競争"
 MAG_free_enterprise_desc: "極東の軍閥時代、マガダンの貿易政策はかなり制限され、限定されたものだった。これは産業保護というより、国家の安全保障が理由だった。商人や貿易商になりすませば諜報員などが簡単に国境を越えて行き来できるようになるからだ。国境を越えて人や物を移動させることがいかに簡単であるかということが伝わると、国民は行動を起こすことを要求した。党はこれに同意し一連の制限的な貿易法と国境規制を打ち出した。\n\nしかし、今は時代が違う。もし、資本主義と自由市場の力を経済に解放したいのであれば関連する諸法律を廃止しなければならないだろう。"

 MAG_establish_the_transbaikal_state_university_desc: "トランスバイカル国立大学は我が国最大の大学の一つになる可能性を持っている。もともとソ連が崩壊前の建設ラッシュ時の計画で建設したもので鉱業学部、法学部、経済学部、建設・環境学部などいくつか学部を持つ予定だった。規模も大きく、建物も比較的よく保存されているので職員を配置し、新しい学校として我が国の高等教育制度に組み込むことはさほど難しいことではないだろう。"
 MAG_research_and_development_facilities: "研究開発施設"
 MAG_research_and_development_facilities_desc: "ロシアが何度も学んできたように、現代では最新の技術を取り入れることが極めて重要なのだ。近代的な軍事技術に長けていることが重要であり、学ばなければ近代的な近隣諸国との戦争で潰されてしまう。それに経済的な意味でも技術は重要なのだ。\n\n新しい生産技術やテクノロジーは常に革新されており、我々の製品が世界市場でより競争力を持つようになるには技術を革新し、取り入れることが必須である。そのため、新たな研究開発施設への投資は、政府資金の投入先として理にかなっている。"

 MAG_a_sibplan_of_our_own_desc: "ブハーリンのシベリア計画は、ドイツに対抗するためソ連を前線のはるか後方で工業化しようという積極的かつ野心的な苦肉の策であった。この計画はブハーリンが政権から追われるまでの短期間に大きく進展し、現在でもシベリア経済の基盤となっている。\n\n我々はこの成功を見習うべきだろう。この計画はソビエト連邦では秘密でもなんでもなかった。なぜなら膨大な人員と資源を要するからである。ゆえに旧ソ連の工場長や管理者は今でもこの計画について知っており、我々の管理局でさえも何年もずっと隠され続けていた文書や設計図を見つけている。これら計画や設計図は我ら独自のシベリア計画に利用することができる。極東計画、になるかもしれない。"

 MAG_the_industrial_recovery_act: "産業復興法"
 MAG_the_industrial_recovery_act_desc: "自由市場はいち地方に素早く産業化し、富をもたらすには最適なのだが、そのような投資が本当に行われるようになるには、通常インフラが整備される必要がある。そのため、産業復興法は数百万ドルを投じて古い工場を改善させ、新しい工場を建設することで外国企業がシベリア国民共和国に根を下ろす動機付けにすることを目的としている。\n\n建設資材や原材料、交通インフラをすべて提供し、安く簡単に工場を立ち上げることができれば、投資家はやってきて、投資するだろう。"
 MAG_the_homestead_act: "ホームステッド法"
 MAG_the_homestead_act_desc: "各地域では現代の技術によって農業や建築がかなり多くされるようになったにもかかわらず、土地の多くは人口がまばらである。ホームステッド法は人々が都市を捨てて北部の自然あふれる自由な土地で生活することを奨励することによって問題を緩和することを目的としている。国有地を無償で提供するだけでなく、さらに農民やホームステッド農業者のために建設資材を中心とした政府の余剰物資を大幅に割引された値段で提供することで支援する。うまくいけば、これまで生産性の低かった土地がさらに活用され、人口増加に拍車がかかることだろう。"

Luckily, they barely keep even tentative control over the area, and have allowed the Russian Liberation Front to continue to operate through what only could be ineptness on their part.

While we're still planning on pushing westwards to reunify the entirety of Russia, there is also much to deal with domestically. The former Vozhd, tyrant and dictator, Mikhail Matkovsky once promised sweeping reform to placate the people and to create the illusion of cooperation to attract the investment of the Americans.

Our administration has worked too hard to marginalize Matkovsky's supporters and too much has been risked to allow a simmering of military support to boil over into a coup. We must investigate those who have ties with the Laborists - or any political wing.

That is, all federal, state, and local governments should work together, cooperatively and collectively, in order to solve problems shared among them.

He spent his time working hard to create and preserve a nucleus of support - one that still, regrettably, exists despite his removal from power.\n\nThe shadow of the Vozhd still hangs over our administration, and his supporters, hiding in said shadow, prevent us from achieving what needs to be done. They need to be rooted out, exposed for who they are.

In return, these corporations would be granted preferential treatment in a quid pro quo scenario.\n\nThese corporations have, of course, become accustomed to this sort of a deal, and now that we're in power, are in what is essentially open revolt due to our refusal to honor the prior deal.

Because of the origin of the party there, many in the international scene, let alone in Russia, know it as the center of what was once the organization that systematically terrorized those that it believed to be its ideological opponents.\n\nBut Harbin is so much more than that. A center of Russian émigré culture, a home to many, including our dear leader. A place where cultural roads crossed with one another.

Justice was not objective - it was served and dispensed virtually directly from Matkovsky himself via parrot judges and puppet juries, who manipulated outcomes and rid the Vozhd of his opponents.\n\nThis has long been one of the darkest stains on the legacy of our party and has until this point held up our development of the future. We must ensure that a comprehensive reform of our justice system takes place to root out those that have done Matkovsky's bidding - the corrupt, the ideological, and the cowardly; these are the people who have no business judging whether the Russian citizen is guilty or not."

It's time for a constitution. In fact, it's well past the time for a constitution. But now we have a chance to right Matkovsky's wrongs.

Matkovsky tapped his feet. He has no time for that now.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, Matkovsky found himself adjusting his glasses, his fingers rapping the table in sequence. A thousand questions swarmed his mind. What if the Tsarists reject the treaty? What if they find the terms unacceptable? He shuddered to think of what would happen if both sides did not cooperate against Rodzaevsky. Someone knocked on the door. Rather than answering, Matkovsky's index finger mimicked the rhythm on his table.\n\nStanding from his seat, he said aloud, \"The letter is not ready yet. Go away.\" The knockings stopped.

This incident is hardly isolated. The intensifying raids coming from both sides of the border, as well as the destruction of valuable remnants of Soviet roads and rail, have become more and more frequent. Our forces are stretched thin, barely enough to cover one side of the front. When the Tsarists attack, the traitors join them, forcing us to expend our resources in two directions. We inevitably lose some in the process: whether it is men, weapons, or plain loot.\n\nRodzaevsky sits in his office, pondering what to do next. This pact has marked a turning point in the relationship between the three components of the Anti-Bolshevik Front. One can only wonder what fate awaits them next.

A typewriter, surrounded by rolls and rolls of ink, practically a luxury. Petlin could not imagine writing those letters and appeals by hand. He had spent long hours in this office, and his fingers twitched as he prepared himself to type again. His assistants could only do so much; none spoke English, and to ask Matkovsky for aid would overstep propriety.\n\nHe sighed. He remembered the words Matkovsky told him. \"Convince the man in the White House,\" his master had said, staring into Petlin's eyes without flinching, \"That is all.\" Matkovsky did not like being taken lightly. At the best of times, Petlin could see the old Harbin spirit in him, a spirit of hope, of kindling, of a prayer for a new home. The winter had extracted its toll upon the man, and the gaunt, flushed cheeks were but symptoms of the payment.\n\nHe looked beneath his desk. Stacks upon stacks of paper, numbering almost in the thousands. Soon, upon the completion of his task, these would be sent to America, finding themselves in the mailboxes of Senators, Representatives, Russian émigrés, and other assorted people who were receptive to Matkovsky's project. On top of the furthest stack, lay a folder, bound in manilla yellow. Plastered to the front of it was a label that read: \"The Siberian Bill of Rights.\" The document contained Petlin's personal ideas to solicit more aid, or at least sympathy from Americans. He wondered if Matkovsky knew what his real sympathies were.\n\nHe shook his head. Now was not the time for the mind to wander. He laid his fingers upon the keys of the typewriter, and the clacking began."

Anastasy Vonsiatsky, also known as the Count of Russian Fascism, had set foot on the port of Magadan. He strode forward, his steps eager and his gait quick, impatient to meet his so-called equal in the old world. Covering his nose once he discovered the smell of the docks, he looked small, pathetic against the backdrop of wooden fishing ships about to depart into the morning light.\n\nMatkovsky furrowed his eyebrows. No one in this world currently has the right to address him in such a way. Giving an awkward, pained smile towards Vonsiatsky, he and his bodyguards walked forward to meet this Count. Extending his hand, a gesture of hospitality, Matkovsky said, \"Zdrastvuyte. How has America treated you?\"\n\nVonsiatsky wasted no breath in clasping Matkovsky's open palms. \"Great, brother.\" He leaned forward, planning to catch Matkovsky in a hug. Matkovsky relented. America must have changed Vonsiatsky. The intimate gestures, the overenthusiastic, unreserved spirit, and that greeting: it was all a bit much, coming from a fellow Russian. Still drunk in that spirit, Vonsiatsky said aloud, \"It is the land of the free. All this,\" he gestured with his hand, \"Is too small for us.\"\n\n\"You seem to forget the reason you are here, brother.\" Matkovsky said, a hint of coldness in his voice.\n\n\"No, no.\" He dipped his hands in his pocket. \"This man is a gift from me to you.\" He showed Matkovsky a black and white photograph of an American in a beret."

Amid the piers, rows upon rows of wooden fishing ships lay steady, their hulls quivering in the fierce wind, shallow rain, and restive waves. There was one vessel that stood out among the others, a metal deck, with rust coating its bows. The tumultuous air did not even seem to flinch it.\n\nMatkovsky, followed by an aide bearing an umbrella to shield him from the downpour, walked forward to this strange vessel. If Vonsiatsky had been speaking the truth, then there was no question to the owner of this ship. Mitchell WerBell, legendary mercenary, the veteran of a thousand wars worldwide, an infamous soldier of fortune, the Wizard of Whispering Death. Matkovsky steeled himself to meet this legend of a man, before seeing a figure stumbling out of the ship, staggering towards him.\n\nMatkovsky blinked. There was no mistaking it. The figure was WerBell, looking more green than in the photographs Matkovsky had seen of him, a beret hanging precariously on his scalp. Matkovsky tightened his pace, striding forward at such a pace that his aide had difficulty in following him. When he came face to face with WerBell, the man tried to give a clumsy smile, only for it to be mistaken for contempt.\n\n\"Welcome,\" Matkovsky said, in English, \"We have been expecting you, Mr. WerBell.\"\n\n\"Privet,\" WerBell said, \"My tovarisch.\" He continued in Russian, mixing it with English words when he had no clue which words to use. Matkovsky, for his part, tried to dissuade him from bastardizing the Russian language, and occasionally a word or two made it through WerBell's manners, but he was inconsolable. What little correct Russian he spoke was sprinkled with generous helpings of \"fucking\" and \"shit.\" Blushing furiously in anger and embarrassment, Matkovsky finally extended his hand.\n\n\"Here's,\" Matkovsky said, trying to keep his smile in place, \"to the start of a beautiful friendship.\" WerBell clasped his hand with neither doubt nor comprehension."

There was no danger here, and the Siberian woods were quiet, the wind whistling between the trees and the air cold as ever.\n\n\"You think the Vozhd will let us back?\" Boris asked Ivan, who was squatting beside him, watching the surroundings while smoking a flimsy cigarette.

It could be the air, could be genuine anxiety and terror in the face of war.\n\nA figure passed ahead, in the dirt trails they were watching: a mercenary. It was apparent from the gear they carried. Proper camouflage, an assault rifle, a belt chock-full of grenades as well as other miscellaneous tools of warfare, and, most importantly, the attitude. The man walked forward without any concern or worry, his footsteps lighter than the bravest man in the RFP. However, he had no reason to be here. The front lines were where he belonged, not here.\n\n\"Halt!\" Boris said, unslinging in his rifle and pointing it at the mercenary, who did likewise. Ivan followed suit. \"Turn back.

They went up and down the document, examining its fine print, looking for chinks in the deal that the Tsarists - or the RFP, for that matter - could exploit. No word on it seemed to raise any reaction from Matkovsky beyond an occasional rise of the eyebrows and a nod.\n\nPutting the document aside, Matkovsky turned to address his foreign minister. \"Petlin,\" he said, chilling every bone in the minister's body.

In front of him were remnants of a campfire, and the results from the hunt last night: two foxes and a rabbit. Waking up to greet the new day, he lifted his sidearm and looked over it, balancing it in his hands as he did so. Apart from some dirt stains, it was clean. He pressed the magazine release, and then pulled the slide back. A cartridge flew into the air with a faint ping. All the bullets were there.\n\nSo far, Oleg did not have to use his gun on anything. No bear nor leopard even came close to him, although he did see them in the wild. The foxes, rabbits, and other assorted animals he hunted were the results of his traps. Using the gun on them would ruin their flavor and make them possibly unsafe to eat. To survive, Oleg learned, one must be ready to not only exercise force, but also restraint.\n\nHe picked up the stray bullet and shoved it back into its magazine. Time for his daily ritual. Setting himself down, Oleg began taking apart his gun. Setting the parts down on dried rabbit fur, he took out his canteen, and started cleaning the parts delicately. After each piece was free of grime and dust, he rubbed them on the fur, making sure they were dry. With icy fingers, he assembled the gun. To see if anything was wrong, he slid the magazine back and cocked the action. A snap. Oleg smiled. Today was a good day too.\n\nThe Siberian Rangers would come back for him, any day now."

 MAG.14.desc: "Rodzaevsky stepped out into the harsh morning air, dressed in rags. Two RFP guards trailed him, rifles trained on his heart and head should he try and make a run for it. They shouldn't have bothered. On his face, the fire that had burned bright during the darkest moments of the RFP in Harbin was naught but cold embers. His hands and legs chained, he hobbled forward, dragging his feet and maintaining a precarious balance and momentum.\n\nAt their front was a makeshift gallows, constructed with the sole intent of executing the former chief leader of the RFP. The Bandit King of Amur, as he was known, now walked like the poorest beggar in the Far East, towards his impending death. Three men patrolled the site on Matkovsky's orders, making sure the execution was as private as possible. For all he had done, Rodzaevsky was still a former member of the RFP, a party that takes care of its own.\n\n\"Stop right there,\" a guard said, right beneath the stairs to his doom, \"I have something to ask.\" Rodzaevsky suppressed the urge to giggle at this man; what can a dying man say in the face of his fate? He nodded. \"What did the Vozhd say to you last night?\" All eyes were now on Rodzaevsky, every ear tuned to hear what he had to say.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" Rodzaevsky said, sotto voce, \"can we get this over already?\" He intended to carry what Matkovsky said to his grave. The guards brought him to the rope, then placed it around his neck. They made him stand on a stool, before aiming their rifles at him again, prepared for a last, desperate escape attempt.\n\nThere was no need. In a few moments, a guard kicked the stool from beneath him."

Boris was probably safe; the mercenary tagged him in his shoulders. So far, using vodka, scraps of clothing, and the bandages he found on the merc's body, Ivan had managed to staunch the bleeding, the blood gathering in dark red clots beneath the bandage's white veneer. Boris moaned every time they went up and down crossing the rough Siberian terrain, but his ragged breathing and delirious groans meant that one thing was clear: he was alive.\n\nAll the way, from the lines back to the camp, Ivan screamed until his throat was sore, \"Medic! MEDIC!\" Yet, the grounds were silent, and the trees and bushes did not accept nor condemn his call for help. Boris was growing heavier by the minute, his weight settling into Ivan's shoulders like a cross. His breath became shorter and shorter, as the woods refuse to part way and yield to the camp.\n\nNot far now, Ivan thought, for every step he took. Not far. Every rock, fallen branch, and mound of soil endeared themselves to his eyes and feet, as he slowed down. He was close to fainting. He took his knife out and tried to prick his thumb lightly; his touch was less than gentle, and in his panic, he slashed his hand. The wound was not deep, just enough to keep him awake. He bandaged his hands, taking a slower and measured pace.\n\nIn half an hour, he reached the camp, finding it empty and deserted. Night had descended. The medical staff had fled, along with most of the troops. Had he been faster, had he been quicker, he could have saved Boris. He laid his friend down on the ground, and held his hand, as Boris's breath faded, fainter and fainter. He tried. He really did. Fate had not given leave for Boris to survive.\n\nLuck did, however. A truck horn sounded, and in their headlights was Ivan, holding his friend's hand and his tears at bay. He could not believe it. Gathering his will, he said, in a shaken and torn voice, \"Friend or foe? Russian or mercenary?\"\n\n\"Friend,\" came the reply, \"Russian. You are safe now. The Vozhd awaits in Magadan.

Their equipment was in a similarly poor state, with most \"soldiers\" equipped with creaking, almost non-functional rifles like old Arisaka models and Mosin-Nagants dating back to the days of the Great War. A good fit for an army of wax models in a museum, perhaps, but not enough for a host with the intent to fight, as the Vozhd (Russian leader) humbly put it, \"a total crusade to save Russia.\"\n\nWe commenced training as soon as we pinned down the RFP's situation. That is where we encountered another problem: the nepotism ingrained within the \"officer corps\" of the RFP was so prevalent that men who could barely hold the weight of a rifle bore such high ranks as Lieutenant, Captain, or even Major. Pressed on the issue, the Vozhd agreed to fire these people immediately, much to his credit. He also approved the building of several officer schools to whip up the higher ranks of his army into shape.\n\nThe reports we have received from the frontlines indicate good results. The border clashes against their neighbors have indicated a good increase in performance, regardless of victory and defeat. We will continue to monitor the situation and issue reports whenever possible. Mason out."

In Magadan, they walked around town, their expensive gear strapped to their bodies, flirting with the girls and ladies they saw along the way. They seemed not to have a care for Russia; it was just another playground for them, a vacation, a holiday in a desolate land where they got to shoot the natives. Smith (no given last name), in particular, came from South Africa, his hands itching for the trigger of the gun, his ears for the thrill of gunfire, his head and brain for the conduct and raw barbarity of combat.\n\nWerBell wasn't lying when he said that his gear was going to be good. His M16, strapped to his back, was the meanest piece of lead spitter this side of Russia. The RFP militias did not have them, only given old US M1 Garands instead, for they were not Smith. The fields, savannahs, plains, and jungles of Africa made themselves known through his copper, sun-burnt skin. He had all the reason in the world to be cocky. When his folks back home ask him why he had gone into the business, \"To find a lady,\" came the answer. All who truly understood Smith knew that he wasn't in it for love, but the thrill of war and money.\n\nHe could see the Russians eyeing his gear with envy in their eyes. He smirked at them and winked. Every time he smoked, they would marvel at his tidy, clean, well-rolled cigarettes. Once in a while, he even offered them one. Warfare was a trade, and business was good. Leaning back against a wall in a random part of the podunk town, he took one of his fabulous cigarettes out and lit one.\n\nFor a backwater and deserted place, Magadan was pretty good. Not on the level of Bloemfontein, but pleasant enough. However, his heart was never there. Out west, closer to lines of the tsarists and Rodzaevsky's loyalists, beneath the blazing gunfire and artillery bombardments, was where he belonged. With a puff of smoke, he threw the cigarette down and stepped on it. It was time for action."

He had never taken the Bandit King of the Far East to be such a meticulous and attentive person. He looked around the room. Alcohol, drugs, coffee, every substance of comfort crowded the lone desk perched on the far end of the room, in front of the open windows. The afternoon sun's faint light filtered into the room, and the glasses of Rodzaevsky's excess glimmered like gems against the backdrop of the steel-gray sky.\n\nCovering his nose through the rank smell, he reached a drawer and pulled a file out. M section, Matkovsky, Mikhail. His photo, young and handsome, graced the file. Its pages were surprisingly clean, tidily typed. At first glance, it could pass for a well-written letter. The contents and notes of it stood in contrast to its exterior. Long, run-on sentences cursed Matkovsky, and a phrase drew his eye: \"Kosher Fascist.\" Matkovsky smiled. Never change, old friend, never change.\n\nAll that remained, then, was to compile a list. Though most of the RFP were Russians, Matkovsky's wing of the party could not accept Rodzaevsky's without some adjustments. Some would follow the fate of their master. Some would be free to find their fortunes in the wastes of Siberia. Some would be the RFP's prodigious children, wayward sons of Russia who lost their way. All would serve Matkovsky.

Petlin, the man he considered to be almost a brother to himself, his own foreign minister! He stared into Petlin's eyes, finding fear and obedience settling their weight into his psyche. Maybe this was not intentional after all.\n\n\"Sir, if I may explain myself,\" Petlin said, freezing his hand before it could correct his tie, \"The Americans are different from us. We need to-\"\n\n\"I get your point, Petlin, it's just,\" Matkovsky said, waving off Petlin, \"This is not what I - not we - stand for. When I read your document I found phrases like the 'right to assembly', 'right to free speech.' These are all dangerous ideas, not fit for Russia. Their rebellious intent practically jumps off the pages.\" Matkovsky sighed, \"Just what the hell were you thinking, brother?\"\n\nPetlin gathered himself and stood straighter. \"Sir, if I may insist, my ideas can still be useful. Not only in convincing the Americans but the Russians as well.\" He cracked his knuckles in anxiety. \"I have faith in the strength of our ideals and conviction, sir, I do. I beg you not to mistake my incompetence as rebelliousness.\"\n\nMatkovsky felt a rare moment of generosity, stretching his arms wide. \"Petlin, Petlin,\" he said, tapping his foreign minister on the shoulders, \"I would never. You have been with us since the beginning, closer to me than even my chancellor.\" He whispered to Petlin, \"Now help me with all these, I am afraid that your brother lacks the skill necessary to convince the Americans.\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" Petlin said, his voice trembling, \"I will do as you say.\"\n\n\"Good.

There was an irony to it all: despite having been schooled and educated in one of the most renowned countries on Earth, Mason was as out of his depth as the illiterate Russian fascists standing before him. The cold, chilly air of the early morning gave his percussive heartbeat a tinge of anxiety and excitement in his veins. The training fields were empty save for a few animals scurrying underfoot.\n\nAn officer prefaced him. \"From the honorable nation of America,\" he goes, \"Mason has come...\" A bunch of feel-good bromides and legalese, but he guessed that the soldiers needed to respect him first before they would be willing to listen to him. He caught a few of them eyeing the equipment he brought here. Mason didn't think it was all that impressive, considering the things he had seen while working in the agency, but, again, cultural and technological differences.\n\nAfter a few hour-long and anxiety-ridden minutes, it was finally his turn to speak. He drew back his tongue and lashed it out, throwing the dust off the language he seldom used. \"Hello,\" he said, \"as the officer has said, my name is Mason.\" He grabbed an M1 Garand and held it against his shoulders. \"This is the Garand. You.\" He pointed to a random soldier in the crowd. \"Fire your weapon, see how fast you can do it.\" He pointed to a target in the distance. The soldier had to eject his casings every time he fired. Sometimes, he resorted to hitting his rifle with his wrist before it worked.\n\n\"Now watch this,\" He aimed the Garand and fired eight shots in succession, his streak stopped by the ping of the gun.

The chilly morning air seemed not to have any effect on the Vozhd, who was in full military dress, as he and his high command approached the troops in formation. All of the soldiers were dressed as he was and sported their weapons of war, but even before he approached them, Matkovsky could tell what poor soldiers they would make. His generals exchanged nervous glances with one another.\n\nOne soldier was too fat, the other malnourished. The third was too short and the fourth didn't have his uniform's buttons done up right. They all had the full uniform, but it seemed as if they had simply borrowed bits and pieces from their peers, as a lot of them didn't fit. All of them, not just these four, were equipped with weapons that looked like they had been outdated by the time the Germans were ravaging the west of Russia. This sorry state of affairs made it blatantly obvious to Matkovsky that on one of the most important days of their lives, these troops could barely muster together even the smallest shred of professionalism. The inspection ended, Matkovsky politely walking along the columns of the Magadan garrison, taking mental notes. Scruffy beards, outdated weapons, ill discipline. Matkovsky knew that it wasn't their fault, for the most part. He had a chronic shortage of bodies, weapons, and officers, all of which were necessary for raising and maintaining a professional army.\n\nAfter the inspection, he had called a meeting of his high command, where a rare flare of anger shone through his usual professional behavior. \"What is going on? These are the best troops that you have to offer me?\" he asked his generals. A number of cursory excuses were offered, but Matkovsky put his hand up to demand their silence. \"I don't want to hear it. If those are the men who guard the capital, what do those on the front lines look like? How do you think we will overcome Rodzaevsky, let alone retake the entirety of Russia? I don't care what the solution is, I want you to find it. And I want to be briefed on it this time tomorrow.\""

Matkovksy's generals and administration had taken upon themselves to figure out some way to improve the true RFP's fighting ability. \"The answer was simple,\" mused one senior officer. \"When we realized we couldn't use conscripts, we bought soldiers from abroad instead.\" Indeed, mercenaries and military advisors, state-sponsored or otherwise, have been slowly but surely streaming into the frozen port of Magadan to not only pad Matkovsky's army of ill-suited conscripts, but to train them as well, to crack the whip and bring them, kicking and screaming, into the world of professionalism. The fat ones were now skinny, the malnourished ones healthy. All of them had a semblance of fighting spirit for the first time ever, and the guns, while still archaic, were at least cleaned and maintained properly. Training, as barebones as it was, actually began to prepare the conscripts and their mercenary counterparts for the realities of modern warfare in the frigid forests and marshes of Siberia. All this of course was tacked on to a very long and expensive bill that Matkovsky had to pass off to his administration. He was confident that there would be something for them to pay the mercenaries with.\n\nAfter Matkovsky's second inspection of the troops, which like the first, was kept as a surprise, he once again called a meeting with his general staff. As they filed in, worried that the new inspection was not enough of an improvement from the original, many nervously fiddled with pens, or reports, while others looked anywhere but where Matkovsky stood. As they all assembled, the Vozhd spoke. \"After this second inspection,\" he said, in his normal, reserved manner, \"I want to say good job, to all of you.\" Many were surprised. \"I know that the task I assigned to you was not an easy one, and while we're far from perfect, I am pleased with the progress that we're making. The path to seek out mercenaries and foreign support was not one that I would have expected, but it's clearly working, and I will be meeting with some top advisors about how to increase the numbers and effectiveness of these foreigners.\" And then, finally, the rare \"Thank you.

American coffee, cigarettes, and even radio were available, and quite common even. They were cheaper than native-Magadan goods, although they were often sold out by the end of the day. Nikita bought a pack of cigarettes and a can of powdered coffee. Smiling at his newest gains, he strolled to the edge of the town, returning to his home in the northern reaches of Siberia."

 MAG.34.desc: "It all started with a game of cards in a bar, Alexei's joint, just down the street from the port of Magadan. There, a couple of locals, their names blurring on the party report sheet, were playing blackjack. The gamble was over a couple of drinks and several hundred rubles, nothing big, but nothing small. They expected the night to go on as smoothly as it always did, a cruise into the moonlight as the games continued, pockets emptying and men filing into the street with the grace of drunken feet.\n\nThree listless men entered into the bar, new arrivals in Magadan. They were WerBell's men, heavily armed and heartily paid: professional soldiers that hailed from all corners of the world. They had too much free time. At first they and the locals got along quite nicely, which is to say they did not interact much at all. Only silent nods and scarce eye contact bridged the difference between the group.\n\nThe uneasy truce did not last long. The listless men flirted with the girls behind the counter, and the locals did not like it. Standing up, they shouted profanities at the mercenaries in a language they did not understand. It did not take long for the soldiers to unholster their pistols and threaten the locals. It only took a minute before one of the mercenaries accidentally fired a shot, resulting in a dead civilian who was only found hours later after the rioting that ensued.\n\nThe locals, instead of being driven back by gunshots, charged the armed men, using broken bottles and chairs to attack the new arrivals. WerBell's mercenaries, dispatched as a backup for the new arrivals, got involved shortly. The party's police, who intervened to stop more bloodshed, were met with a rain of bullets and jagged glass.\n\nAfter a dozen dead civilians, and two dozen more wounded, the riots were finally put down by force. The three mercenaries were immediately tried and sentenced. The party's police, for their part, did their job - after two hours."

It wasn't the first time she noticed that her father tended to linger outside for a bit before entering their house. Now, as the sun was setting, its orange light aged his features beyond the man's already formidable years. He had joined the party since its first days in Harbin, and was a veteran of the Anti-Bolshevik Front.\n\nPeople from inside the party, further up in the hierarchy call her father Vlad the Tall, in mockery of his height. Outside the party, they called him a thug, a criminal, a robber vested with a RFP uniform. Sometimes he could see his reputation manifest itself when he met his neighbors. Small business owners, shopkeepers, and the fishermen of the port looked at him with a mix of fear, reprehension, and disgust. Any time any of them dared to cross Vlad's path, however, they scurried away almost immediately when he drew his gun, a trusty Nambu he had kept by his side for years, again, since the days of Harbin.\n\nIn Katerina's eyes, however, she did not find a monster in the figure of her father, standing as a single silhouette against the dying day. He felt his mask lapse and vanish every time he spoke a word to her. The icy and reserved, aloof, harsh, and cold attitude melted, revealing beneath them, if not a decent man, a husk of one.\n\nShe ran out the door, and caught her father's hand, surprising him. \"It's dinner time,\" she said, a smile across her face and words, \"Get in!\""

 MAG.36.t: "A Note from Russia"
 MAG.36.desc: "Presidential Briefing on the Free State of Magadan\n\nContents:\n\nThe nation of Russia has been a great unknown since the end of the Second World War. Following Barbarossa and the Soviet Union's collapse, the CIA could scarcely glean any information from that vast country. Except for the West Russian War of the 50s, the Russia of our imagination had become a cesspool of violent infighting, with the German bombings preventing any attempts of regional warlords to consolidate power.\n\nAt least, this seems to be the case in West Russia and Siberia. With a land area that stretched from the Baltic to the Pacific, there are some stretches of territory untouched by the banditry and chaos that plagues the areas adjacent to the German Reich. From Central Siberia, the primary recipient of the Bukharin-era Siberian Plan, we have heard that a Republic had risen and collapsed there between the Second World War and the West Russian War.\n\nThen there is the Russian Far East - a region that the CIA has been observing for quite some time. In brief, the legitimate government of the Soviet Union (under the provisional leadership of Genrikh Yagoda) retreated there after their defeat; subsequently, the Anti-Bolshevik Front sprang out from Manchuria and Harbin, making significant gains before shattering into three parts based on Chita, Magadan, and Amur.\n\nIn particular interest of this briefing is the Free State of Magadan, led by Mikhail Matkovsky - a local fascist of some repute. He and his foreign minister, Nikolay Petlin, has promised reforms and democracy should the U.S. support their bid for the - as the Matkovsky insisted - \"great crusade for Russia,\" as well as intelligence and information.\n\nThe Agency notes that the decision is the President's alone to make. However, it cautions the President in supporting any fascist bid for Russia. Moreover, the aforementioned minister, Petlin, seems to be a more malleable candidate for leadership. Whatever the President decides, the Agency shall carry out."

 magexp.1.desc: "\"Is the meal to your liking,\" Matkovsky said, as his hands cut another piece of beef, \"Mr. Romanov?\" Sitting across from him was the alleged Tsar, Mikhail. Candlelight illuminated those eyes that a few days ago had seen the muzzle-fire of rifles as the RFP stormed the \"palace\" where Mikhail ruled. The truth was, despite the regal garb and silverware elegant enough to act as a mirror, Mikhail was no more than a puppet for the old-style White Army types. While he waited for the response from this \"Tsar,\" Matkovsky put his fork to his mouth, tasting the ragged, almost-done taste of the steak. Not good, not terrible.\n\nMikhail chewed, swallowed, and set down his utensils. Before he spoke, he wiped his mouth with a napkin. Taking up a glass of wine, he turned to regard Matkovsky, his gaze crisp and calm. \"It was,\" Mikhail said, straightening to deliver his verdict, \"an adequate dinner.\" Matkovsky smiled at him. From what he heard about the reluctant Tsar, Mikhail was never one to hold back his honesty. For all the legitimacy he lacked, Mikhail had one thing many in the Front did not have, from the monarchists to the fascists: a spine. He took a sip. Putting his glass down with a silent thud, Mikhail said, \"Mr. Matkovsky, perhaps you will entertain a question from this humble prisoner.\"\n\n\"Speak your mind,\" Matkovsky said, the dinner practically over at this point, \"your 'Majesty'.\"\n\n\"I realize that my position in Russia has grown rather... tenuous.\" Mikhail gave himself a chuckle. \"Not that it has been well in the first place, but there you go.\" Leaning back, an act of defiance against royal etiquette, he drew a deep, heavy sigh. \"So, what'll happen to me now?\"\n\nMatkovsky stared at him, deliberating. This \"Tsar\" was a potential danger. Mikhail could be a dangerous contender for power. On the other hand, the monarchist strain in the RFP was wearing away and fast. Soon, no one would take Mikhail's claim seriously, and letting him go into exile, far away from Russia, might be the prudent - and decent - decision. Matkovsky opened his mouth to speak."

In one quick gasp, he expelled all of it out, letting his lungs bask in the warmth of the fumes and smoke. It had been an excellent day. As the Vozhd, he recognized that his work would never cease, but the heights! Oh, the heights that he had reached. From the underling of a madman into the head of the new Anti-Bolshevik Front. He snorted. Life was absurd; life was good.\n\nIn front of him was no alcohol, no whiskey, no vodka. He was drunk from another substance that had addicted him since the beginning of his career. Photo albums, in black and white, as well as in color, filled the surface of his desk. From the times of the old RFP in Harbin to the first incursion to Siberia, he had it all. Here he was, standing next to Rodzaevsky and Semyonov. There he was, inspecting the troops in the name of his old master, their black uniforms standing in contrast against a frozen background. He was young then. A true believer. A wry and sorrowful smile rose on his lips. If only men did not change. His mind wandered over the photographs, searching in vain for that turn in destiny that would perhaps have preserved their brotherhood. He found none.\n\nHe drew on his cigar again. His eyes wandered to the dusty, untouched gramophone in the corner of the room. Matkovsky stood up from his seat, and the Vozhd left the room."

He could see his breath stirring in front of him, in white, flaky pieces of air. The port had smelled the same, bearing an odor of brine and rotten fish, with a subtle tang of salt above it all. Petlin and Pavlov went up and down the piers, their silhouettes dark against the pale, weak morning light.\n\nA random thought struck him. They had not found WerBell's body. Try as he might, with his men spread out across the tundras and forests of Siberia, he could not find him. He sighed and breathed the scent of the sea. Wherever the mercenary was, he did not care. Dead or alive, WerBell was out of his way. He stepped forward and strode onto the docks.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSomewhere in the world, a soft rock tune played in the background of a tropical cafe, overlooking a beach. A gruff, balding man sat in the corner, reading a newspaper, his cup of coffee untouched. He had to settle for cigarettes. He had fun in some exotic locale recently, and it was a crying shame that it ended. Fucking fascists. First they wouldn't pay, and now they kicked him out. What had the world come down to? He shook his head. No more honest employers these days, it seemed.\n\nHe put the papers down. For the first time since the morning, he tasted the coffee. Mud. It was time to look for new places, new horizons. He left some money on the table, accounting for tips, and left the cafe, cigarette in mouth."

Surplus arms from the U.S. arsenals distributed among the soldiers have had an incredible effect, and the officer training has borne fruit. I can say without hesitation that the Vozhd's army is the most advanced in the Far Eastern territories; praise only checked by the old, military adage: they still have room to grow. The prospects of the Vozhd's \"Crusade\", - a term he insists on to no end - seems bright.\n\nContinuing from the last report, the RFP in Magadan has defeated their counterparts in Amur. Along with this development, they quickly broke the truce they had with the Tsarists in Chita and toppled the Tsar there. In one fell swoop, Matkovsky has succeeded in reunifying the old Anti-Bolshevik Front, albeit by force. Barring other emergent factions in the area, we are confident in saying that the Vozhd currently possesses the strongest forces in the East in terms of personnel and industrial capacity.\n\nHowever, we feel the need to qualify this series of rapid progress. There remains another significant force in the Far East: the Reds and the hardline RFP. The only main concern that the RFP and U.S. personnel note are the rumors from the Northern Siberia, of a religious leader amassing power among the tribes there. Though the probability of the RFP's victory remains high, we recommend further and closer inspection of regional developments. Mason out."

For now, there were only two significant contenders, with the communists marked in red and new, rejuvenated Russian Fascist Party in blotches of black and brown. He laid his fingers on the lines that demarked the boundaries between the two mortal enemies. In the dark cold of his office, he could feel the heat rise to his touch, as decades of hatred and enmity burned in the frontlines.\n\nA thud. Petlin didn't mind it. It was probably an aide stumbling their way through the dark. He looked outside the windows of his little room. The night was bright, with momentary gaps of darkness, as the clouds conspired to keep the light of the full moon for themselves. In the coming days - he did not know when, maybe in a week or a month - would be the days of another confrontation. He sighed. If only there were another way. A knock on the door woke him up from his reverie.\n\n\"Coffee, sir?\" an aide said, bringing a tray full of the hot black liquid, steam rising from the cups, \"I thought you wanted some, as I made some for the men.\"\n\n\"Put it on my desk,\" he said, breathing a sigh of relief. At least, it wasn't the Vozhd, come to check up on his work. \"Mind the map.\" The aide gingerly placed Petlin's cup on the northern edges of the map, its fragrant fumes spreading its way through the room. As he lifted the tray, however, he knocked it over, spilling the coffee. The aide hurriedly drew his handkerchief, but Petlin stopped him. The damage was already done. No amount of wiping would ever clean the map.\n\nThe aide withdrew from the room, profusely apologizing all the while. As Petlin examined the stain, however, he remembered the rumors from the north, of a heretic amassing his forces to free the Siberians from the tyranny of fascism and communism. While the blot expanded and absorbed more and more of the paper, Petlin found his mind wandering. Perhaps this was an omen."

As a member of the Siberian Rangers, it was perhaps unsurprising that he was handpicked for a field position in the SIA. He had to be careful not to press the paper too harshly against the tree bark, or he would tear the fragile and thin piece of grey paper apart. The notes themselves were simple, what he'd seen that day, the weather and geographical conditions, as well as the dispositions of the nearby locals.\n\nThe last part troubled Oleg more than any other. He did not like talking to people. He'd sooner crawl into the trenches of the enemy, evading mines and barbed wire, with machine guns raining fire upon him than talk to a bumpkin who couldn't even get their dialect right. Still, through the rugged surface, he managed to write a tiny bit of what he'd seen and heard of the locals. The data was probably insignificant, but he didn't care. He had done what was asked of him and done it brilliantly. He even talked to one or two of the less obnoxious farmers out there in the wilds. Finishing his writing, he shoved the paper into his pockets and sat down. It was time for a moment of rest. He took out a roughly rolled cigarette and lit it.\n\nIn the hands of the SIA, individual data was useless. Collectively, however, they might be the force that decided the battle. He dragged the cigarette out, letting the smoke cloud and cleanse his mind. After this, Oleg would go into the offices of the SIA and type up his report, drawing up conclusions and recommending courses of action for the higher-ups. He would rather be in the Siberian Rangers still, but maybe this life was good enough."

It was early morning, and the roadside snow lay in thick clumps, a fair bit of distance away from the woods to which the vehicle was headed. Occasionally they would come upon a bump on the road, and the four had to lift the blindfolded man back to his seat.\n\nTo their relief, the latter was silent. The voice that had proclaimed liberation for the workers of Russia from atop the radiowaves had held back, its will broken. He could do nothing now, his eyes shut, his hands tied behind his back - his followers lay dead in the fields, and whatever remained of his legacy would thaw like snow come the next spring.\n\nWhen they arrived at the clearing, a random spot in the middle of Russia designated as the \"execution point.\" Opening the cargo bed, they took the blind man and brought him out by the elbow, setting him down, gently as they can, to a patch of snow-covered soil. Then, they made him stand and walked him forward, to somewhere he did not know. An atheist all his life, he confessed that he regretted nothing, and the calm stillness of the dawn greeted the eerie silence of his heart. He did not need the opiate of the masses; his pain was his own.\n\nThey took the blindfold off him, and the sunlight shocked him. How many days had it been? How many months, years - how much time? They stopped, and he knelt. His eyes remained fixated on the sky above.\n\nThey read out his sentence. Rifles clacked, and all ends pointed to his head. \"By order of the Vozhd of the Russians,\" a voice read out loud, somewhere in front of him, \"I sentence you, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin,\" he was ready. \"To exile!\" He pointed his head down and looked around him, lost. The guards gave him a revolver, two bullets, a coat, and some black bread. After that, they departed.\n\nHe wanted to laugh, and he giggled.

An officer brought a radio to the frontmost table, for tonight, the Vozhd was on the airwaves, preparing to deliver an address to the people of the Far East. It was silent, save for the clatter of plates and the slosh of liquid soup as the servers lowered their ladles unto dishes. No one touched their food.\n\nA wave of patriotic music swept over the barracks. A voice, that of their dear Vozhd, Mikhail Matkovsky, spoke, booming and echoing through the room. \"Good evening, the people of Russia!\" he said, \"tomorrow, past midnight, a new age begins. The Reds, long traitors to the virtues of the Russian people, have been defeated. Their armies lay dead in the fields, their ideologues, their party, their presidium, their pretensions to legitimacy, all scattered to the four winds.\" A semblance of cheer broke out within the ranks, although everything stayed calm. The clattering and the sloshing continue between the spaces of Matkovsky's words.\n\n\"My loyal soldiers, militant and martial, the armed wing of the Russian Fascist Party, the true heroes of the proletariat, have broken through the darkness that had caged and jailed Russia for so long.\" A patter of claps joined the clatter and slosh. \"They shall be the vanguard of a new revolution - a revolution not brought about by the necessities of inhumane ideologies, but for a renewal, a rejuvenation, for a new, for a powerful Russia to take her place once again among nations!\"\n\nThe patter of hands, fingers, and palms joined together, a storm that drowned all the other noises.

The sun hadn't yet set, but it was best to be ready when it did. His pen scribbled on the creamy, expensive paper that the Vozhd had brought for him, a generosity that matched the grandiose scale of his commission: the history of Christianity in the Far East. With each stroke, he struck the thought and the memory of how he came under Mikhail Matkovsky's service, a story that he - and perhaps only he and God - knew. He gritted his teeth, vowing to carry the tale to his grave. Each man bore a different cross, and this was his: not to die in honor but to live in shame.\n\nHis pen halted upon reaching the Fifties and the Sixties. Here, he sighed. For the sake of posterity, perhaps the future would do better not knowing the crimes done to reach a better age. Aside from the general chaos of Russia, he found himself stumped. Other than the obvious and apparent, there were no notable events that had happened in the Far East. He would have to consult his archives, documents, and books. Perhaps there he would be able to forge a narrative convincing enough, real enough, that there would be none who would question it. He opened the first book, a baptismal record he had set on the table, and began reading, leafing through its pages to find and secure the desired truth.\n\nWithin the first few pages, the black bars started to appear. A certain Father, whose name was blotted out by thick, messy ink, had baptized hundreds in a village - the name blotted, struck out of living memory. Zakhar recognized his handiwork. He had to do it in a hurry. It had been a hard choice, but he could not let the integral history of the monastery disappear. Zakhar remembered the Father, a man who undertook the difficult mission of proselytizing to the tribes in the north. Nobody thought that he would return, yet he did - bringing not peace but the sword. Zakhar rode out with him to the south, an aide in his war council, from the beginning until the end.\n\nHe stepped outside, the weight of warm and bright memories twisted into darkness. The laughter, the tears, seemed to burn in his ears, a ringing sound that wouldn't cease. Then he saw the graves, their silhouettes dark against the dying sun. Rows upon rows, for miles upon miles. He saw the crosses of his comrades, men and women, that they bore in life, and that now they carry unto death. Crosses of rough-hewn wood, unmarked, and unnamed. He collapsed to his knees. Perhaps today, too, he would fail to bear his."

Yagoda himself had either died or disappeared; the Vozhd would not care for either. Preferably, the Vozhd would have had him shot - but fate did not will Matkovsky to do so. Dmitry nursed the stump that had once been his arm. He still felt it, at night, grasping at imaginary objects, gripping the handle of imagined doors, and brushing against walls that only belonged in his mind.\n\nIvan was out there, somewhere. The quiet bastard didn't even accept any form of thanks from him. A single grunt, and hands that shooed away any cigarettes, canned food, or money. Dmitry's prosthetic lay beside him, on the grass, its sockets yearning for an owner to wield them. Not now. It had been some time since the doctors amputated his gangrenous, infected arms in a dank, full medical tent. The morphine they provided had not been enough, and he still dreaded to think of the night.\n\nTurning to see the pile, he saw a guard in RFP uniform walk towards it carrying a can of petroleum. Others carried leaves, branches, and whatever flammable material they could find and smothered the pile with it. The heavy odor of petrol reeked as the guard first opened the can and then poured it on the papers, shuffling away from it, leaving a trail. Then he lit a match, and all of them watched as the fire caught the path fixed for it, and gently set the records ablaze.\n\nDmitry observed the flames burn with disinterest. What had transpired between the Vozhd of the Russians and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, he did not care. He felt the flames brush his face, its heat intensifying by every second.

A small miracle - not having to deal with the bickerings of his own party. Nikolay Petlin came to the podium, and Mikhail waited to hear what was first on the agenda.\n\n\"The first order of business on the agenda; the arrest of Mikhail Matkovsky.\" Nikolay stated calmly, with a single bit of iron to his tone.\n\nThe Vozhd froze, and then blinked. Had he heard that right? Arrest? Him? For a moment, he assumed it was a joke. A single bit of dry humor from a man who wanted his position. However, no one in the party protested. No one in the party laughed, or raised their voice. The Laborists he had greeted just minutes ago turned pale, and the room remained utterly silent.\n\n\"For numerous crimes against both Russia, and the Russian people...\" Nikolay continued, but Mikhail was no longer listening. How could this have happened? How did this happen? It wasn't possible. It wasn't. But as he stood there with a dumbfounded expression, shock written across his face, the guards moved. Not to arrest Petlin, or to shoot him on the spot.\n\n\"Traitor.\" The former Vozhd whispered once quietly, as the guards moved to restrain him. \"TRAITOR! YOU - BASTARD! You and your Reformers, every last one of you a bastard! You can't - \" Arms wrapped around his own. Rage, fear, and sorrow compressed into a single scream.\n\nNone of his own clique look at him as he's dragged away. The guards ignore his pleas. And Nikolay Petlin, his spineless foreign minister, his subordinate, his replacement looks him in the eye the entire time he's dragged out."

He had already heard the doors slamming, the engines roaring like hellhounds off to drag him down to his final judgement, and the boots of soldiers slamming the ground as they made their way up his driveway. He knew what was coming, he had for weeks. Between the ominous looks from Laborists, his allies disappearing, and the Vozhd's stranglehold growing ever tighter, Petlin knew a reckoning was coming. The death of any hope of freedom in Magadan was at hand. Yet, despite how much he had prepared himself mentally, the event still shook the man to his core.\n\nPetlin heard downstairs his door coming off its hinges unceremoniously as Matkovsky's thugs stormed his home. He stood up, awaiting the three armed men rushing up his staircase and into his study. As he raised his hands in a gesture of surrender, suddenly his breath was stolen from him as the primed-for-combat soldier at the front tackled him at the waist. Dizzy and in pain, Petlin was rolled onto his back and shackles were snapped onto his wrists as his charges were read out.\n\nTreason. A believable charge, an expected charge. It still stung to hear that all his efforts to improve his country had earned him the title of traitor.\n\nThe traitor was dragged out into the street. His neighbours stayed indoors so as to not incur the wrath of the Vozhd. Instead, they watched through their blinds as Petlin was thrown into the back of an unmarked truck. It sped off down the street, never to return to this place. Through his blistering headache, Petlin had only one thought."

The Reds in Petropavlovsk had converted many for smuggling, large sections torpedo rooms stripped of their cylindrical warheads, replaced with cargo holds and additional accommodation. Now in the hands of the Siberian National Republic, the process was completed, the last vestiges of their warfighting capability having being stripped from their hulls.\n\nAbramov looked over the half dozen or so vessels now tied up at Magadan's port, the blue-gray waters of the Sea of Okhotsk lapping at their hulls. He checked over the manifest, most of the vessels would be assigned to smuggling from Petropavlovsk or Magadan to Alaska, providing the Republic with a steady stream of income and hard currency. Some of the older vessels would be laid up, their hulls a source of spares for the rest of the fleet, and one would be used as a training ship, educating a new generation of submariners in the art of surviving under the sea. Taking a glance at the setting sun, Abramov walked back to his new office.\n\nPouring himself a mug of coffee, he let his mind drift back to the meetings in Manchuria, the reclamation of the Far East, and the breakup of the Harbin Three. Times were simpler back then when they had Yagoda's Supreme Soviet keeping everyone on the same page, but the differences and the disagreements eventually grew too deep to paper over. He was amazed he'd managed to survive the cutthroat politicking long enough to throw his lot in with Matkovsky.\n\nNoticing his mug was empty, Abramov moved to refill it, he had enough reminiscing for one day, there was work to do."

Normally ambassadors from the states competing to reunify Russia are seeking diplomatic recognition, trade deals, or weapons, and usually all three. These men have come to America for a different purpose though. With the reunification of eastern Siberia, they report that the process of \"stabilizing and rebuilding the Motherland\" has begun. Citing this new stability and their long history of cooperation with the United States, they have requested permission to work with several Russian expat organizations in America. Their hope is to encourage Russian refugees and their families to emigrate back to Siberia and \"heal the wounds the Nazis inflicted on the Russian people.\"\n\nNormally we would hesitate to allow representatives of a foreign government to work in the United States with the goal of persuading people to leave the country, but these are not normal circumstances. The Siberian National Republic, despite its authoritarian tendencies, has shown strong interest in aligning with the OFN, and if we play our cards right it could become a firm ally in a region of vital importance. The SNR has a strong opposition to Nazism and Communism, and while it would be easier to work with the Japanese they have instead courted us, and it would be unwise to ignore their overtures. In addition to all of this, the Russian émigré community in the United States is small and it is unlikely many will leave California or New York to return to Siberia. Those who do choose to go would likely return to their homeland either way.\n\nWith the downsides of accepting so far outweighed by the potential risks of rejecting the Russians, it has been decided that we should allow them in. We wish them luck on their mission. They'll need it to convince anyone to trade the greatest nation on earth for some arctic tundra."

He knew his daughter was only seven, and didn't understand the significance of what she'd just said, but she had just made his decision a certainty. He was Russian. His wife was Russian. His daughter had been born in Sacramento and had never been outside of the United States, but as far as he was concerned she was Russian too, and now she was saying Russians were stinky. Had some of the kids at school said that? Knowing their parents, it wouldn't have surprised Igor. They were just like everyone else in this country, always looking at him and Sofia with that uniquely American mix of pity and contempt. He was sick of it. When he'd heard about the Siberian Repatriation Program at the Russian Cultural Center last month it seemed like his prayers for a way out had finally been answered.\n\n\"Why do we have to leave America?\"\n\n\"Because Russia is safe again sweetheart, and now we need to help make her strong again too.\"\n\n\"But I like America.

It was miserably cold outside and the airport's insulation was far from perfect, but he still felt a warmth in his belly. It was the same warmth he felt when he met Sofia after arriving in San Francisco in the ancient year of 1947 or when he'd first held Sasha in his arms in the hospital in Sacramento. There was some indescribable joy in seeing all of the signs and labels written in Russian and confirming that he could still read his first language. Even hearing the chatter of all of the other people at the airport was an unexpected joy. The familiar words and syllables brought back so many memories of better times, before everything had gone south.\n\n\"Papa?\"\n\nSasha's question snapped Igor back to reality. \"I'm sorry sweetheart, what did you say?\"\n\n\"Why can't we go to Vladivostok instead?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" He hesitated for just a moment. \"The Japanese control it.\"\n\n\"Darn.\" Sasha replied.

Every week a few more of those faces would arrive, presenting their passports and documents to customs workers who would wave them through an expedited arrival process. At first it was barely a trickle, but soon that trickle had grown into a stream and the stream into a flood of new immigrants arriving in Magadan, Kamchatka, and Irkutsk.\n\nFor most of these new arrivals this is an opportunity they have waited decades for, a chance to return to the homeland that was stolen from them decades ago. For others it is a chance to start over, to build a new life in a new nation where their past is only as important as they choose it to be. For a few it is a chance to see the Motherland they grew up hearing stories of but never dared visit themselves. With the warlords vanquished and order restored to the east, they can finally see the nation their families loved so dearly.\n\nWith the number of immigrants increasing by the day, more customs agents have been hired and the visa application process has been streamlined to reduce delaying arrivals and integration as much as possible. All across the globe the children of Mother Russia have heard the wonderful news: the nation is rebuilding, and the time for all Russians to do their duty has come at last.

As they quickly apologized and redoubled their efforts, Matkovsky huffed and turned back to his desk before him, where he was attempting to complete what work he could before the trip.\n\nIt was hard to imagine that by tomorrow, he would be in America, self-declared land of the free and, much more importantly to Matkovsky, a potentially crucial ally against the Japanese dogs. With the aid of the Americans, celebrations might be held in old great Vladivostok yet, and that alone was reason enough to attempt to form this relationship with Washington. As long as they were of use, the Americans could try to push their senseless ideals onto him all they liked if it made them feel better, not that it would do them any good in the end.\n\nWhen at last his things were packed, Matkovsky gave in with a sigh, putting his pen down and getting up to head to bed. He was too distracted by his thoughts to properly get work done, and he needed to be rested for the meeting. If all went well, Russia would have a very powerful friend in the world, one who could change everything for her."

 magreg.13.desc: "Washington's foreign policy bubble is abuzz in response to the news that the US has visitors: a delegation from the Siberian National Republic, a statelet which recently consolidated the easternmost lands of Russia under its control. The star of the show is the so-called \"Vozhd\", Mikhail Matkovsky, a leader whose cunning and drive are renowned in Russia expert circles. Matkovsky is controversial, however; his critics accuse him of running what is in effect a fascist dictatorship, antithetical to the idea that American foreign policy should seek to uphold democratic values. Less idealistic elements of the national security community point to Matkovsky's pragmatism and anti-Japanese sentiment to argue that the SNR could be a valuable ally, and perhaps one that the United States could influence for the better.\n\nThe Vozhd's visit, announced only shortly before his departure, is expected to last several days, with meeting the President being the high point of the affair. For Matkovsky and his men, long fighting for their lives in the frigid Far East, the Washington D.C high life may be a dream come true. For liberal politicians, it signals that their country's attachment to democratic values is far more tenuous than it appears, and several Republican and Progressive congressmen have already made their objections clear.\n\nMatkovsky's goals are still unclear, but the consensus is that he seeks greater political and economic cooperation with the United States, possibly coupled with military aid. While some on the American side may be willing to hear him out, that fact is contingent on whether he is truly open to reforms, or just another despot ruling over the fallen remains of a great power."

One of the first stops for any erstwhile warlord on his world tour is the United States, and indeed, the Siberian National Republic's Nikolay Petlin is reportedly making his first state visit to Washington. Petlin's history has already made him popular among the American political class; he first took power by toppling the region's authoritarian strongman, Mikhail Matkovsky, and has promised to further democratic reforms as development continues.\n\nIn the Far East, with few inhabitants and fewer resources than it would like, foreign patronage is a vital political concern. Back at home, all eyes are on Petlin, as closer ties with the United States could greatly strengthen its chances of winning the grand Russian power struggle. Closer diplomatic and economic ties are likely the goal of this meeting, with the Holy Grail of military aid for farther off in the future.\n\nPetlin's chances look quite good; with the exception of a few dissenters who question how far the SNR has truly moved from fascism, most of Congress seems open to the idea of expanding relations, and the President has not signalled opposition. His few days in D.C. could mean the beginning of a mutually prosperous relationship - in the meantime, Petlin might take the opportunity to relax a bit in America's comparatively luxurious capital."

Even as the Vozhd, it was a struggle to find comfortable furniture. The phone conveniently sat on a table right next to him, and he decided to make use of the amenities. \"Room service?\" A short silence.\n\n\"What do you need, Mr. Matkovsky?\"\n\n\"Give me rum.\" He thought for a moment. \"Cuban.\"\n\n\"That'll be right on its way, sir.\" A few minutes later, he reclined sipping a drink that had been the stuff of dreams just a few years ago. If Rodzaevsky wasn't dead, he would love to have seen his face. His thoughts turned to the day's events. Things had started off poorly; his welcome on the tarmac that morning was marred by the presence of a group of protestors, shouting all sorts of anti-fascist invective. They were lucky they hadn't met him at home. Mid-afternoon, once he was properly settled in, he met with the President for what turned out to be a very productive series of talks, where they discussed a number of topics ranging from the need for cooperation against Japanese aggression to the possibility of expanding economic ties in the future. To questions about political reform, Matkovsky made vague promises about democratization far off into the future, when the internal situation was more stable. The President was a reasonable person, and would naturally understand the delicacy of such matters. At least, that's what the Vozhd hoped.\n\nThe dinner was sumptuous, and Matkovsky very much enjoyed playing the part of the dignitary. He was particularly pleased to give a toast to a world without tyranny, earning substantial applause from those present. All in all, it had been a good enough showing for the Siberian National Republic's return to the world stage. He felt himself drifting off to sleep, and made one final mental note: find out where he could order a chair like this for his office at home."

Better than Matkovsky would have done, perhaps, but that was low-hanging fruit, and didn't necessarily mean he was successful. Still, he thought as he leaned back into his luxurious seat, feeling his worries wash away, it was a wonder in itself to enjoy finery in a hotel like this. Nothing in Siberia compared. The Americans truly did not know how good they had it.\n\nSpeaking of the Americans, their welcome had certainly warmed him. Russian expatriates and American lovers of democracy alike had cheered his arrival on the tarmac, and Petlin couldn't help but wave to them as he passed with a stupid grin on his face. He felt like a soldier returning home from a victorious war. Once he had been settled in, he had met the President himself for a series of surprisingly productive talks about topics ranging from cooperation against the Japanese aggressors to the expansion of economic ties between Siberia and the United States. When questioned on political reform, Petlin presented a concrete plan of gradual but certain democratization, assuaging the fears of the Americans. Though meeting one of the world's most powerful men in a room had certainly been intimidating, he had turned out to be a reasonable man and soon Petlin's anxieties calmed.\n\nThe dinner that followed the talks was the best meal Petlin had eaten in years, and the applause he earned upon giving a toast to a world without tyranny made him feel like a hero. Petlin felt fairly confident that it made for a strong diplomatic showing to mark the emergence of the Siberian National Republic onto the world stage. Falling asleep where he sat, he began to dream of that feeling of heroism he had quickly come to love."

The recent delegation to Washington appears to have been a significant factor in assuaging their fears, and the President signed onto the deal with little opposition from the rest of the government.\n\nThe agreement between the US and SNR outlines significant political and economic cooperation, the expansion of trade between the two countries, a communication line between both countries' leadership, and a number of other provisions ensuring a firm working partnership for the years to come. Surrounded by rivals, such an opportunity could not have come sooner. Long isolated from the outside world, we finally have a lifeline, and one to a superpower to boot!

Despite a visit by an SNR delegation to Washington D.C., the Americans ultimately decided that closer cooperation was not in their interests, either because of the SNR's history as a derivative of the Russian Fascist Party or because they did not see the value of a client in the remote reaches of Siberia.\n\nWith this decision, our future in international affairs becomes substantially murkier. Perhaps the Americans can be persuaded to reconsider their offer when the SNR controls more of the Russian landmass, but for now we must be ready to fight for Russia's future alone. Without a major international patron, our foreign policy has been significantly weakened, with potentially dire consequences. In Magadan, where many people's hopes rode on further connections with the United States, the mood is grim, and many of our diplomats are undoubtedly being chewed out, or worse."

We are told in Siberia that the battles are tough and the winters are cold, but with American guns and fuel their troubles are sure to be few.

Whether it is scrounging up what we can from the pillaged resources of our neighbors, or increasing the appeal of illegal shipping to the Port of Magadan, we must work tirelessly from the ground up.\n\nIn this Russia, crazed with pain, we are once again forced to resort to using smuggled goods and arms from Western and Japanese markets to prop up our republic. Faced by enemies from all sides, our failure to secure American support in our struggle against warlordism and the Siberian wilderness are telling of how truly alone we are in our fight for supremacy in this corner of the world.\n\nWith a firm resolve to improve our misfortune, [MAG.GetLeader] turns his eyes to other markets, local and international, to attract the flow of arms and supplies to our domain.

That, however, was all he knew he could expect for a very long time.\n\nHe remembered that night in his printing shop. True enough, what he had known to be inevitable had finally occurred. The RFP had discovered his little effort of resistance. But, apparently, he wasn't important enough for them to spend the effort on disappearing. And so he found himself here.\n\nThe Dalstroy was, ostensibly, a public works program. As he and others were now experiencing firsthand, however, the program was little more than a way to imprison dissidents and other 'undesirables,' while working them to the bone besides. He recognized others who had rebelled, in their own small ways, against the Party. And now they were all beside each other, digging trenches for railway ties.\n\nOne day, he knew, things would change. They had to. But for now, seeing the hard-eyed look of an overseer and wanting to avoid the fate he had seen doled out to others who worked too slowly, he put his thoughts aside and picked up the shovel.\n\nThere was work to be done."
 magreg.25.a: "His abilities used in a more appropriate manner."
 magreg.26.t: "Factionalism Rears its Head"
 magreg.26.desc: "The recent party congress has triggered a phenomenon previously unheard of in Magadan's halls of power: the formation of factions. As part of Matkovsky's token reforms to the political system, opportunities to express dissent within the National Labor Party have grown, and a number of politicians have decided to take advantage of these to attempt to change the government's course.\n\nMatkovsky's personal faction, the so-called Laborists, remain the largest bloc. An eclectic mix of moderate fascists, national conservatives, and personal loyalists to the Vozhd, this is the status quo wing of the party, advocating a very slow, moderated political reform under the umbrella of a single-party state. Even with the opposition more visible within the state apparatus, the Laborists hold nearly all of the power in practice, just the way that Matkovsky would like it.\n\nIn many ways, reform only generates more appetite for reform, and this certainly applies in Siberia just as anywhere else. Protesting single-party rule, Nikolay Petlin has formed his own Reformist wing of the party, one composed of advocates for a genuinely democratic system. Matkovsky's interest in political change only goes so far; his distrust for Petlin is well known, and the Reformists can be expected to be an underrepresented if loud section of the party.\n\nBringing up the rear is the Old Guard, a practically vestigial wing of the party led by fascist hardliners. As there is practically no desire for a Rodzaevsky-style return to extremist ideals among the populace or the political class, the hardliners are isolated and powerless, mostly made up of obscure, ineffectual figures. Many speculate that they are kept around as merely a negative comparison to Matkovsky's \"moderate\" rule, and scapegoats for his worst decisions.\n\nThis new era signals unprecedented pluralism as well as unprecedented conflict within the party. Only time will tell if the SNR is significantly impacted by the decision."
 magreg.26.a: "New rifts reveal themselves."
 magreg.27.t: "大ソボル"
 magreg.27.desc: "Within his office in Magadan, Nikolay Petlin allowed himself a small smile. For the first time in years he could reasonably say that he was hopeful for the future. After months of careful maneuvering he had convinced Matkovsky to allow a primitive legislative body to be formed. The Grand Sobor was barely worth the name, but it was a start.\n\nThe Vozhd was still the ultimate power in Magadan, as he was not about to give up more than token influence over the nation. In fact, getting Matkovsky to relinquish even what little power that was given to the Sobor was almost miraculous in and of itself, but even so a victory had been scored for the people of Russia, as minor as it was.\n\nIt was clear to Petlin that Matkovsky thought the matter closed, that the token reforms he had allowed would be the end of the discussion. He believed he could simply go back to closing his mailed fist ever tighter around the Russian people, but Nikolay knew in his heart that he had only just begun. The Russian people had suffered for so long and they deserve so much more than a council that would rubber-stamp Vozhd Matkovsky 's decrees. It would be difficult, and very dangerous, but he would do all he could to bring about a Russia that its people could be proud of."
 magreg.27.a: "The one step at a time."
 magreg.28.t: "ヴォシチの意思によって"
 magreg.28.desc: "In an internal communication sent this morning to senior members of the government, the Vozhd flatly rejected a proposal to establish a legislature, confirming his intention to remain the sole authority - executive or otherwise - within the National Republic.\n\nThe push for a national parliament, led by the so-called 'Reformist' wing of the National Labor Party led by Nikolay Petlin, and envisaged as a revival of the Tsarist-era Zemsky Sobor, was one of that faction's primary goals. It is as yet unknown what the effect of this rejection will be, though many within the party expect it to be significant.\n\nThe Reformists are, as expected, enraged by the decision, but even members of the Vozhd's own 'Laborists' have displayed unease. Though they of course support the absolute primacy of the Vozhd, they see division within the party, especially significant division as evidenced in the response to such decisions, as an inherently destabilizing and worrying trend.\n\nMany are predicting the struggle for power between the factions to only grow more intense and, while others make seemingly futile appeals for unity in the face of the Republic's many enemies, foreign and domestic alike.\n\nIndeed, although to the Republic at large the National Labor Party is a monolithic one, it is becoming clear that the divisions within it are deeper than ever."

Yes, of course!\" Sergei agreed, as giddy as a child on Christmas. \"I'm happy, listeners, because the Siberian National Republic has finally agreed to subsidize us, with our content as free as ever. Radio Free Magadan isn't just freer than ever, it's richer!\" Sergei cackled with glee, still scarcely able to believe it. A small, rare smile spread across Vasily's face; he could not blame him, with how hard it was to believe. They truly had come far.\n\n\"So, let us thank our generous sponsors by starting off the show talking about them. Sergei?\" Vasily motioned for his co-host to speak. \"Yes! Recently, I've heard some talk that over in America, people are guaranteed the right to assemble. A right to assemble! Can you believe it, Vasily?\" Sergei exclaimed. Without waiting for a response, he continued. \"I'm starting to wonder why they don't let us do that here. It could be of great benefit. Just look at how powerful the Americans are!\"\n\nVasily considered this a moment, nodding slowly. \"You know, Sergei, for once you might have a point.\""
 magreg.29.a: "Fascism is a fad, radio is forever."
 magreg.30.t: "Free in Name Only"
 magreg.30.desc: "A teenage girl by the name of Galina Alexandrovna, living a relatively comfortable but ordinary life in the town of Magadan, excitedly rushed to sit down at her family's dining room table, where the radio was located in the center and where her parents already sat. It was time for Radio Free Magadan's latest broadcast, and Galina's family had made something of a family event lately of listening to each broadcast after a long day. Not that there was much else to do as a family around town, but still. \"Well, what are we waiting for? Turn it on, turn it on!\" Galina's father chuckled at her impatience and complied.\n\nHowever, the voice that awaited them was unfamiliar, and as cold as the Siberian weather. \"Good day to all tuning in. As you might have already guessed, the old hosts-\" Galina could hear the man's contempt for them in his voice. \"Are no longer present. They have been taken away for subversive activities, and as such, the Russian Fascist Party will now be operating Radio Free Magadan directly.\"\n\nAs if to emphasise his point, two gunshots rang out in the background. After pausing a moment, the new host decided to ignore it, but he did not have to comment on it for Galina to know who had been killed. \"I will discuss the news in just a moment, but first, join me in pledging allegiance to our righteous Vozhd Matkovsky. Oh Matkovsky, Vozhd of all Russians, bring glory to-\" Galina couldn't stand to listen to another word, and shut the radio off. Her parents looked up at her with concern, but made no attempt to turn the radio back on; there was no need. It was simple to figure out what the rest of the show would consist of, now and for the rest of its existence. They, like their daughter, were horrified at the revelation. However, they were but ordinary people; they were no more powerful in this country than ants under a boot. That was to be the future of all ordinary people, it seemed now, just as it had been in the past: to be trampled on by the boots of tyrants forever."
 magreg.30.a: "The Vozhd killed the radio star."
 magreg.31.t: "A Brief Glimpse of Daylight"
 magreg.31.desc: "Nikolay Petlin scraped his fork across the plate for about the fifth time since the last bit of meat had been picked clean. Embroiled in thought, he continued to swirl the bits of sauce and grease that remained as his mind wandered. The taint of fascism was running deeper and deeper in Magadan with every passing day, stretching its tendrils across his fair country and tightening its grip. There was an anger there, for sure, but there was also optimism coupled with the tug of despair. It was his duty to rid what was once a protective measure, now a vile curse, from Harbin and Russia at large. Just as he was about to scrape the plate once again, he heard his wife pipe up from across the table.\n\n\"It will work out. I have faith in you.\" Spoke Lydia, already knowing what was tearing at her husband. It haunted her too, in fact. Every facet of Magadan reeked of the RFP and, by extension, her late ex-husband Rodzaevsky.\n\n\"Will it? There is so much work to be done, Lydia. Matkovsky rules like a butcher and every day it seems like freedom gets further away and fascism gets stronger.\" Replied Nikolay.\n\n\"Someone has to do it, Nikolay. Gladly, that person is you, but you don't have to do it alone. I know these types, hell I was married to one. They're strongmen. Matkovsky is a man who rules by fear and brutality. A force of freedom will always topple a paper tiger like him.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Nodded Nikolay. The burden was not entirely eased, but at least he had some measure of reassurance. But moreso, he simply wanted out of the conversation. So, with a stiff upper lip he picked up his plate and placed it in the sink before heading off to his study, his mind abuzz with the same witch's brew of emotions."

 magreg.32.t: "A New Beginning"
 magreg.32.desc: "For Nikolay Petlin, the last few days had been a whirlwind of confusion and danger. The tyrant Matkovsky was in chains, arrested in a moment of weakness by a man he had thought so below him to be more a bug than a man. Petlin's supporters held the former Vozhd in a secure cell within Magadan, under close guard. It was almost enough to make him laugh, the sheer luck that had been necessary for the success of the coup boggled the mind.\n\nHis co-conspirators had risked it all to overthrow the Tyrant, and had Matkovsky been, ironically, more like his hated rival Rodzaevsky he would have likely ended Petlin's rebellion before it had begun. Thankfully, his arrogance had blinded him to the threat brewing under his nose. Now, a similar trouble brewed even as he sat overlooking the city.\n\nIn the depths of his new office, Petlin found himself in a very precarious position. While Matkovsky was safely behind bars, support for the Tyrant of Magadan was high in the army and the Security Service. It would be a perilous task in and of itself to prevent Matkovsky's supporters from retaking control of the government, but it would be a necessary one. For the people of Russia to prosper, Matkovsky's tyranny needs to be left in the dustbin of history."

 magreg.33.t: "A Lesson Learned"
 magreg.33.desc: "Matkovsky sat in his office, reading documents listing all members of the Reformist wing of the RNLP. He crossed another off the list as a phone call rang in, mentioning another name. One more eliminated. Twenty to go.\n\nHe cursed himself for underestimating Petlin. That backstabber had nearly brought the Vozhd's downfall! Luckily, the fool didn't have enough support for his idiotic coup. Still, it was devasting to Matkovsky to know that someone he trusted, someone he thought of nearly as a friend, would go to all that length just to see Matkovsky fall. Were there more Petlin's waiting in the dark for their chance at power? Were his other advisors planning to take him down? Matkovsky shuddered. He never felt so weak and so undermined. He had to be more cautious. Choosing those who would replace the people he had purged would be a hard job.\n\nStill, this was a lesson to be learned for the future. He would never give away power. No one could be trusted. And most of all, he would never agree to sign off reforms that would weaken his leadership ever again! Only he, the Vozhd, could bring Russia to greatness. Only he could succeed in the crusade against the traitors and the Germans!"

 magreg.34.t: "A Flight for Freedom"
 magreg.34.desc: "Petlin watched with a small smile from the window of his office as the everyday people of the town of Magadan went about their lives. They were much happier, much more fulfilled now than they used to be, especially when compared to the dark days just after the separation from Rodzaevsky's forces. Those days were long past now, though, and Petlin preferred to think about happier, more current events. One such thing that occupied his mind was his imminent visit to Washington.\n\nIt was amazing that it was actually happening when he thought about it - he hadn't really thought he would be able to do it. Now all that remained was to finish what work he could as hired aides packed his luggage and prepared his papers before he left tomorrow. Petlin could only dream of what finery awaited him in Washington D.C., the great city of democracy. Soon he would not have to dream - he would get to experience it, to enjoy it himself. Once he had, he would get right back to arranging for all other Russians to be able to enjoy that same luxury right here in their own homeland. For now, though, Petlin put those thoughts aside as he stepped away from the window and sat down at his desk to return to his work. Dreams could wait when the work to achieve them could be done."

 petlin.1.desc: "Petlin adjusted his glasses as he entered Matkovsky's office, in the old RFP headquarters in Magadan. The place definitely seemed lived in. Shot-glasses with neat whiskey in them, and bottles of vodka just gathering dust littered the desk where the former Vozhd had once sat. Matkovsky likely knew that he was being arrested, and prepared himself accordingly. Petlin just did not expect him to indulge in alcohol, in the twilight hours of his political career. Outside, the wind howled, pounding the window-panes with savage force. Petlin wanted to shiver, but he was not cold.\n\nHe remembered the sight of Matkovsky as the guards hauled him away to prison, awaiting trial. A pair of bloodshot eyes, and a pale face that screamed utter defeat. Once, he had believed that Matkovsky was somewhat of a good man: standing up against the blackshirts and the savage barbarity that was commonplace in Harbin were virtuous deeds. When Petlin proposed the Siberian Bill of Rights, the old Vozhd seemed excited at the prospect of a renewed gesture at political reform. However, right in this office, a few years ago, he remembered as Matkovsky tore at his bill, decrying his ideals as \"too liberal.\" Then came the Dalstroy scandal. Matkovsky was a monster all along.\n\n\"No more Harbin,\" Petlin said, to Matkovsky. \"No more the atrocities, no more the ideologies that debase us to the level of beasts.\" He strode to Matkovsky's favorite gramophone and turned it on. March of Siberian Riflemen filled the air. He picked up an empty shot glass and toasted to comrades long gone."

Requests of that nature from Petlin's government have already reached the State Department, and await our response."

We must safeguard the legacy of our predecessors. Matkovsky was a good man, and without him, the party would not have reached Siberia. He was a criminal, yes, but all he did, he did for the glory of his motherland.\"\n\n\"I believe you, Pavlov,\" Petlin replied, his voice calm. \"However, comrade, without Matkovsky the Dalstroy would not exist as an entity. The papers,\" Petlin was exasperated. \"The papers in the Irkutsk Presidium. Remember that? The paper trails he'd burnt to cover his trace. The Soviets might not be our allies but their insight is important. Matkovsky is a criminal, and I will see him tried. No trace of his influence shall remain in this - in my - party. I hope you understand.\"\n\n\"Fine. if you would not recognize his existence, then I will not recognize your government.\" He pointed at Petlin. \"Listen, Petlin. I never liked you much in the old days, but now, there is no reason to hold back. You are not my Vozhd, Nikolay Petlin, and I will make sure the Laborists know that. The SIA, too.\" He stormed out the door.\n\nPetlin was tempted to call out to him, using the American expression. What was it again?"

He toiled, day and night, under starvation rations, sure that he would collapse at any given moment. His body was weak, and the work certainly did him no favors. Ivanov looked at his shoulders and arms. Boney, without much substance nor muscle. The soup they ladled out, thin and unappetizing, did not provide for much sustenance.\n\nThen, armed guards of the Siberian National Republic strode into the camp, arresting everyone. Some of the wardens ran to the woods, after a gunfight with the army. Ivanov heard that the rogue guards had been detained, awaiting trial, same as with their Vozhd. The act startled him. Justice in the depths of the Russian Far East was not unlikely; it was impossible. Yet, there he was, the soldiers casting off his shackles and delivered him away from that hell.\n\nNow, his only concern was that he needed a job. However, surely, President Petlin and his Prime Minister would take care of that. No more shadows, no more domination by powers that only sought power."

The swastika, the hooked cross ran through by electrified lights, shone like a Christmas tree in the freezing winds of Harbin winters. Yet, they stood, neither fire nor flames warming their hearts, but through the strength of will alone. Love, too.\n\nLove, the strongest of all emotions. It was love that brought them into Russia again. It was love that made them think of Russia when the Japanese and Chinese ignored and discriminated against them. Yet, it was love that also begat Rodzaevsky's obsession with a pure Russia, that justified the Dalstroy's atrocities. As Petlin and the people of Magadan held the candles in the remembrance of such tragedies and feats of will, they closed their eyes and prayed. A choir song soft hymns to God, of forgiveness and repentance. Petlin closed his eyes.\n\nHe remembered his own past. An organizer, of voices that once spoke of him with warmth and looked out for him. Of Matkovsky, of Rodzaevsky - they were young then, and all so foolish. So, so foolish. When he opened them, the patriarch led the flock through the Lord's prayer. Petlin followed."

I promise you that I'll be back soon.\" He regarded his wife with a broad smile on his face. Petlin was proud of her. A dissident in her own right, a powerful and active woman, freed from the clutches of Rodzaevsky the madman. He shuddered to think of what the deranged Vozhd had done to her, but she did not tell of her days in Harbin much.\n\n\"See you, dear.\" Lydia said as she corrected her husband's tie. \"Where are you going again? I have been on Magadan for so long that I don't know much about Russia.\"\n\n\"Novosibirsk. The city of the Sun, as they call it, dear. I know that I will be far from you, but this is necessary. Soon, you will leave Magadan, and we shall go westwards. The state cannot hold a government from such a remote position such as Magadan.\"\n\n\"I liked it here, at least.\"\n\n\"I know. We will return here someday when Russia is whole again. Perhaps we'll even cross the straits, into America. See Los Angeles, San Francisco!

Whatever media that Russia had, as well as some foreign outlets from America, trailed the proceedings. All deputies of the Russian National Labor Party refused to comment. Petlin hurried away on his car before the reporters could reach him, bodyguards shoving the crowds away from him. Whatever that could be gleaned from the discussions within seemed to speak in favor of reformism, although no one knew its details.\n\nFinally, on one crisp morning, Petlin stepped out on a podium, the rest of the Russian National Labor Party behind him. \"People of Russia and Siberia,\" he began, gathering his strength to address a nation. Or half of it. \"I stand before you today, the leader of the Siberian National Republic, its President by the will of arms.\" He paused. \"But that will be no longer. I declare thusly: that political parties are now legal, that the government will now seek approval from its people. We dedicate ourselves to the restoration of a democratic, and republican Russia.\" All eyes were on him. \"That is all.\"\n\nCheering broke out as he turned his back to face his party.

In this, Petlin added provisions that defended the rights of free speech, assembly, and the right to organize politically. The Laborists grumbled and complained, but they did not have sole power on the party anymore. The independents, at first wary of Petlin, soon warmed up to him. Finally, after years of dictatorial rule, a leader who would listen to their concerns.\n\nStanding in the halls of the Novosibirsk Assembly, Petlin remembered the previous years, standing before Matkovsky as the presented his idea of a Bill of Rights before the Vozhd. \"Too liberal.\" The words came back to him. \"I am suspecting that you are a socialist, Petlin.\" He gave a chuckle. How was he so weak? If the same Vozhd returned to him, clad in his full glory, Petlin would not submit. The peoples of Russia have their rights, and he shall not deny them their entitlement. He swore that no one shall experience what had happened in Harbin, ever again.\n\nA couple of Siberian deputies approached him, hammer-and-sickle pins on their suits. Petlin became weary, but then they invited him to dinner. He smiled. Perhaps the communists are not as bad as they say, after all."

When Petlin moved to help him, he held his hand out. \"I do not need a traitor's help.\" He coughed blood. \"I am close to dying, and I see my vision for Russia burning before my eyes. Its arsonist stands before me, yet I can do nothing.\"\n\n\"Matkovsky,\" the name sounded strange on Petlin's tongue. \"Would those that stand for the memories of Harbin let the pressure heaved upon us against our own people?

Tell me that,\" he held his breath. \"Vozhd of all Russians.\"\n\n\"You have no right to address me as such! You lowly worm, lowest of the low. To say that I despise you would be an understatement, Petlin.\"\n\n\"The feeling is mutual, Matkovsky.\" They stared at each other, too angry to continue the conversation. \"Trust me with Russia.

He looked at the window, seeing petals of snow unfurl and split in mid-air, the howling of the winter winds dying against the glass-panes. Some flakes stuck, but they slid down, leaving a trail of clear liquid behind them.\n\nHe turned his attention to the list. Sheets upon sheets of names, blotted out in the order of their execution. At the top of the list was his enemy: Nikolay Petlin. The name was crossed out, but in truth, Matkovsky did not know where he went. Still, it was preferable to keep his absence in a more permanent state. Nikolay Petlin was dead, and that was all that mattered.\n\nAides came and went by his room, carrying a chill with them, shivering as they handed out reports of the purge to the Vozhd. \"Hey,\" Matkovsky said to a lanky, blond aide. \"Turn that gramophone on.\" The roar of music and the howl of the winds masked the gunshots, out in the Siberian wilds."

Not the least when he was this close to power.\n\nSo, he would have to be strict. He had entrusted the Russian before with the powers of political liberties and free speech, yet, they betrayed him. Tonight, by himself and a candle-lit room, Matkovsky would bind together a Siberian Bill of Rights. A new one, with none of the flaws of the old. He had to. If the Russian people and dissidents of the party would defy him, he found no better alternative than self-defense.\n\nHe would start by cutting. The former Bill of Rights was too long, too wordy, too ponderous. It spent a lot of its length clarifying useless liberties that could threaten the party's position. Matkovsky did away with them striking provision after provision with slashes from his pen.\n\nWhen morning light spilled from the windows to his desk, he rose, a new Bill in his hand. The Vozhd smiled, his work done."

Yet, he, with the rest of the Sakha people living there, found their names absent from the board. Aysen's eyes looked over the A section, over and over again, sure that there was a mistake. It was blank as if the local officials had skipped over him.\n\nSo, this day, he came to the offices of the electoral commission, seeking to complain. Aysen was rightfully a citizen of the state, and he would not see his rights violated. Inside the log-built wooden building was a burly man who attended a thin slab of plank for a table. Two guards, armed with rifles and pistols, stood on the opposite corners of the room. A door was at the back, leading further into the innards of the office. Approaching the man, Aysen said, \"Sir, I am sorry for interrupting your work, but my name is not on the voting roll.\"\n\nThe man smirked. \"Are you Yakut?\" he said. Aysen nodded. \"My, my.\" He barked at the guard in Russian, who went to the backs of the office and summoned a paper form, composed of five to six sheets. \"Fill this form and do the test. I will decide if you can vote.\"\n\nAysen spoke Russian, but not this kind of Russian. Scientific nomenclatures, technical terms, so many things he could not understand. The form was a literacy test, he realized. A way to cheat the Sakha people from their right to vote. Still, he filled the form with every ounce of knowledge in his mind and handed it to the man.\n\nAn affected disappointment. \"I am sorry, but you can't. Perhaps once you've studied a bit more, you would be able to do so. However, as it stands, I can see nothing good coming out of you voting.\" A smile. \"No offense.\" Aysen left the office fuming, but also frustrated."

 matkovsky.4.t: "Status Report"
 matkovsky.4.desc: "A report was thrown on Matkovsky's desk from the State Intelligence Agency, spilling out sheets of paper and dossiers filled with printed reports and graphs. On its cover, it read 'THE SITUATION IN THE WEST' - gathered intelligence providing a comprehensive oversight of the warlords and bandit republics clashing in Central Siberia. The Vozhd gave the papers a long and skeptical stare, before reaching over and carefully flicking through each page.\n\nHe scoured over each sheet, examining the details of every Bolshevik brigand and opportunist despot rampaging throughout the icy region. Like animals, they skirmished with each other for scraps of food and resources in the frozen plains to the west. Finally, the Vozhd came to a page detailing various strategic and logistical plans for a possible annexation and integration of the region, and his eyes began to glow.\n\nHis authoritarian ego nourished, Matkovsky smirked and tossed the document back on his wooden desk. He leaned back in his chair and reflected upon the proposal, exciting his senses with all kinds of plans to march westwards."
 matkovsky.4.a: "This is only the beginning."
 matkovsky.5.t: "In the Interests of National Security"
 matkovsky.5.desc: "The Vozhd, upon realising control over much of Eastern Siberia, has returned his attention to matters of state security. After all, in order to have a stable republic, he explains, it must be protected from within and without. Thus, it has been determined that the State Intelligence Agency is to have far greater autonomy from legal restrictions and the authority to conduct operations that will safeguard our nation against subversives and revolutionaries.\n\nDoors are kicked down, homes are raided, hundreds are arrested, and traitors are shot. In the name of national security, there can be no margin of error. The Vozhd cannot afford to let this young republic, this great hope for Russia, fall to seditious villainy from the dark corners of the eastern wastes. The siberian wilderness is unforgiving, and for the crime of treason, Matkovsky is too."
 matkovsky.5.a: "We will take no chances."
 matkovsky.6.t: "Fair Elections"
 matkovsky.6.desc: "There were three names on the ballot for the Tomsk-12 constituency. Two were the candidates of the Russian National Labor Party, who had all the support the party could give them. Time in the local radio, campaigning funds, and the posters with their names that stuck on seemingly every window-corner of a Tomsk street. The Peace Preservation Act had mandated strict ideological requirements for political parties, effectively disqualifying any of the Tomsk Salons from running.\n\nThe other candidate was an independent, a former Bastillard. He entered the elections knowing full well that he was at a disadvantage. None of the old Salons could help him. Radios and newspapers refused to give him interviews. He had some discreet money funneled through by his old pals in the Bastillards, but that itself was a dangerous proposition. Should the authorities discover them, he would be charged with fraud and disqualified from the election. So he did what he did in his Bastillard days: standing on street-corners trying to insult people enough to pay attention to him. Some days, he could have a conversation. Others, the police hauled him away, naming him a \"public pest.\"\n\nWhen the votes were tallied at the end of the day, the result was unsurprising. Ninety-five percent voted for the RNLP candidates, the rest going to the independent."
 matkovsky.6.a: "Without political cause, there can be no political resistance."
 matkovsky.7.t: "Volunteer Work"
 matkovsky.7.desc: "After the primaries, Alyosha spent his days milling about the town of Amur, doing odd-jobs and nothing in particular. He had spent a fortune to enter the Russian National Labor Party, only to be defeated in the primaries. Alyosha's politics were liberal: he had hoped to join the RNLP with the express purpose of reforming it from within. Now, bereft of money and opportunities, his days went by too slowly but also too quickly, like candles.\n\nIt didn't take too long for the SIA to find Alyosha. He was not a discreet man, and his behavior had attracted attention. Just as he entered a bar to drink his worries away, two men, one thin and tall, one stocky and beefy, tapped him on the shoulder. \"Mr. Alyosha?\" they said, \"Could you please come with us? We are from the party. We need to talk.\"\n\nAt first, Alyosha was hopeful. Maybe the Vozhd saw potential in him as a politician and had sent these two men to give him a second chance. However, his flights of fancy were brought down by the weight of gravity when he realized that these two men were probably from the SIA.\n\nTaking him to a quiet street corner, they interrogated Alyosha on his faith for the Russian people, before asking him to volunteer in the Dalstroy. His face paled, but he had little choice. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Yes.\""
 matkovsky.7.a: "If one cannot serve in the political arena, mayhaps one can serve as a laborer."
 matkovsky.8.t: "Concessions from the Vozhd"
 matkovsky.8.desc: "Phoning-in this morning, we have received firm assurance from Mikhail Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the Siberian National Republic, that efforts towards the strengthening of their free republic have recently undergone significant improvement. We have insisted in the past that if they want to hear anything from the United States, they too must show their dedication to the rights of men, to which they have appropriately adjusted and committed themselves to.\n\nMatkovsky presented evidence to suggest that the treatment of minority groups has improved from the Russian ruling establishment. Moreover, we are assured that liberties guaranteed in law have been respected by the state and law enforcement across the nation. Indeed, our own few diplomats across the Pacific have given us the thumbs up after being taken on a tour of Siberia by dozens of state officials to see the great potential of the region, not giving us a single tip for anything worthy of criticism in the young republic.\n\nMatkosvky was slow in his replies when we questioned him, but we have faith he will follow through on his promises. Until then, we will continue our diplomatic missions to discover more about the mysterious eastern republic now cozying up to us."
 matkovsky.8.a: "Lip service? Must be an American term."
 matkovsky.9.t: "Rangers Lead the Way"
 matkovsky.9.desc: "\"AND HALT!\"\n\nThe ranks of Siberian Rangers stopped their march, and a great crash echoed throughout the encampment as the soldiers stamped their boots. They stood in regimented columns, upright in rows and awaiting Captain Oleg's next command. These were the new recruits and they had been undergoing viscous training in the wilderness of Siberia to acclimatize them to the bitter eastern chill. Training was harsh, and the officers harsher, but such strict order could carve these men into warriors worthy of the Vozhd's command.\n\nResisting the harsh Siberian cold, they stood still as Captain Oleg walked past and examined each recruit. He looked at each one of the men in the eye and studied their posture. His gaze was piercing and intimidating, his very stare disciplining any sense of disloyalty in the young men's hearts. Captain Oleg reached the end of the column, to which he raised his hand for a moment and the recruits lifted their rifles to their side in synchrony. With his back turned to the recruits, the collective clatter of the rifles reminded Captain Oleg of his early days in the military, and he gazed back at the men to notice they were far more skilled than he was. He smiled beneath his bushy mustache and chuckled for a moment, before returning to his cold and unforgiving gaze."

 matkovsky.10.t: "Grim Tidings"
 matkovsky.10.desc: "Matkovsky sat in his office, drinking wine. Finally, after all these years, a vintage worth its legacy. Warm, sweet, it made Matkovsky tipsy and slightly drunk. The gramophone from Harbin sat in the corner of the room, blaring nostalgic songs: patriotic marches, anthems, Tchaikovsky. The sweet tunes and melodies of his youth brought back memories of him as a teenage boy in the Paris of the East. Finally, all that suffering, all that pain, was worth it.\n\nA knocking on the door, a disturbance to the rhythm. His doctor came through the door, lathered in an icy sweat. His glasses seemed to tremble as he walked forward, his eyes averted from Matkovsky's face. \"S-sir,\" he said, stammering, fear apparent in the crashing of his teeth, \"I-I bring you bad news.\"\n\nLeanig back on his grandiose chair, Matkovsky spoke. \"What kind of bad news, doctor? Can't you see that the Vozhd is having a good time? Can't it wait? Surely you do not dare risk my wrath.\"\n\n\"N-no, sir. It absolutely cannot.\" Swallowing, he continued. \"I am afraid you are afflicted with cancer, sir.\"\n\nFor a moment Matkovsky sat still. He could not believe what had traveled through the doctor's lips. Cancer? Him? At the peak of his life, at this very moment? Lies! Lies! He stood up, calmly, wine glass in hand. Matkovsky jerked his arm back and forward again, catapulting the glass into the doctor's suit, splattering him in red. He wanted to shout, to scream, but he had to be calm.\n\n\"Guards! Guards! Take this man away from me!\" Boots trampled into the room. \"Volunteer him for Dalstroy work. Make sure he is thoroughly educated. Understand?\" Nods. \"Dismissed.\" They carried the doctor out, and sobbing trailed after their departure."
 matkovsky.10.a: "There is nothing wrong with the Vozhd. Nothing at all."
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_70S_DESC: "The hum of the gramophone, the clatter of silverware against plates, the gleam of rooms bedecked in gold and silver - all the riches of the world, within Mikhail Alexeevich Matkovsky's grasp. Yet, he felt it all ebb away, the pangs of pain below his ribs like seizures that recalled Harbin. Before the face of death, every man lives in poverty; the Vozhd of Russia was not an exception. The scent of wine and lure morphine seemed to deaden his episodes. However, when morning comes, the Vozhd stands before his doom: a slow, painful death, dealt with by dice belonging to jesters of fate and chance.\n\nThe chemotherapy, medicines, pills, tablets, all he tried, to no avail. His American friends, who had rescued him from the jaws of defeat time and again, could only upraise their shoulders in a shrug. Matkovsky was old. Only now, at the apex of his power, he entered the nadir of his existence. No amount of political connections, schemes, and purges could cure him. Woe was he! If only he could tear out his liver and be done with it - but no. Matkovsky's lot was to live, and live he shall.\n\nWhen one's death is beyond doubt, all that remains is not what glitters, hums, or clatters, but the quiet preponderance of one's legacy. So Matkovsky looks to the west, across the barbed wires that demarked Russian and German territory. Here will be where he shall sear his name unto the annals of history. Through war or peace, the Vozhd no longer cared. The method is secondary; the ends justify the means - for, after all, the end is near and nigh."

The animal of Amur would have shot him, as would any of the communists. \"You will be well-treated, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" The words are not without bitterness, but bitterness was not unexpected. The tsar looks at the Vozhd with mingled resignation and relief, that he isn't to be made a spectacle and yet not to be free.\n\nThe light seems harsh, the conversation turning to Siberia, and the civil coolness of the Vozhd seeming to drain any protest out of Mikhail.\n\nMikhail Matkovsky sits with the last of the old order, and remembers that it can still inspire. The eagle will be caged, at Lake Baikal. The tsar will stay in Russia, until the new Russia that the Vozhd is building will no longer have any faith in his legacy."

 POLITICS_MITCHELL_WERBELL_DESC: "The story of an American soldier of fortune seizing a Siberian city with nothing but his wits and superior firepower seems like a lurid tale too ridiculous for even the pulpiest dime-store novel. But sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.\n\nMitchell Livingston WerBell III was the son of a Russian émigré, born and raised in America. A brief stint in the OSS, the precursor to the CIA, was his springboard into the murky and deadly world of mercenary warfare. His unsavory missions spanned the globe from Cuba to Kamchatka, yet he still maintained his contacts with some of America's industrial elite and his father's old comrades. One in particular was Anastasy Vonsiatsky, the increasingly elderly Russo-American fascist. When Mikhail Matkovsky's regime in Magadan hoped to use Vonsiatsky as the gateway to American aid, WerBell saw an opportunity. What followed was as bold as it was suicidally insane, but he succeeded beyond all odds.\n\nThrough a mix of diplomacy, favors called in from old friends, and a few well-placed military raids, WerBell has successfully seized power in Magadan and declared the city to be the capital of the Republic of West Alaska. He hopes to achieve the reverse of what Matkovsky hoped with Vonsiatsky, serving as a conduit for a steady flow of American money and arms into his fledgling Siberian empire. However, WerBell's neighbors want nothing more than to drive him into the sea, and this may prove to be something far greater than he can handle..."

Finding opportunities aplenty in Africa and elsewhere, he soon became known as a skilled and brutal fighter, willing to advance into enemy fire in order to seize victory.\n\nWhen WerBell declared the formation of his state, many were confident it was only a matter of time until Faulques arrived, chasing ever more fame and glory, and this has now come to pass.

 MAG.16.t: "Deal with the Madman"
 MAG.16.desc: "Rodzaevsky was not having a good day. The sun was too bright, straining his vision as jagged pieces of light fell into his eyes. He did not sleep at all last night, right after they delivered his verdict. He cracked his fingers through cuffed hands. They were taking him deep into the woods of Siberia, in the middle of nowhere, far from civilization. He felt his body twitch all over. The withdrawal was encroaching on his mind, and an uneasy cold settled over his bones.\n\nThe men tasked with escorting him spoke foreign, faraway languages that he did not know even the slightest. All they did was use the muzzles of their rifles to poke Rodzaevsky forward whenever it seemed that he was close to stopping. He knew that someone in the group spoke Russian; he didn't know which was which. The air grew hotter and hotter, swaddling his body with a thin curtain of sweat.\n\nHis mind wandered to strange places. He wondered about Matkovsky. They said they had never found a body. Rodzaevsky knew Matkovsky and his sly wit. Siberia was vast and empty. It would take a lot of sentries spread across a general direction to eventually find him. Devil, devil! Matkovsky was his worthy opponent: a fellow Russian who contended for power, not a mercenary out for money.\n\nThey reached a clearing in the middle of the woods. One of them, the Russian speaker, went behind Rodzaevsky and blindfolded his eyes. It seemed like even the mercenaries had a touch of humanity. As his sight failed, he heard footsteps trail behind him, and rifles pointed in his direction ready to fire a single shot that would end his life. A voice gave a signal and the enfilade started. Rodzaevsky fell, lifeless, onto the ground."

 MAG.19.t: "The Man Who Sold the Vozhd"
 MAG.19.desc: "Dmitry's mind wandered as he dipped below and soared above death. In his mind, there were no distinctions to be made; he was dead. An alien object nestled itself in his left shoulder, refusing all attempts to move it. The pain kept on giving, a radiant sun that bled an unfading, persistent coppery smell. He had the faintest idea of what happened to him, its images surfacing along with the shocks of pain that sent him receding towards the depths of unconsciousness. He was expecting for Ivan to leave him for dead, and make for the lines in all haste - their reassignment was the fault of his pride after all - but he felt himself tumble and shake, but never falling.\n\nSay what you would about Ivan: quiet, brutish, stupid, but he was a good friend. Dmitry's blood-stained and pain-wracked mind squeezed skepticism of Ivan's efforts, but his heart begged him to hope. It implored with every beat, refusing to let itself die. It grew fainter and fainter, as the hours passed by, but it dragged its death out. Instinct, not intellect, became the lifeline upon which Dmitry hung himself. His grasp was tenuous, and at every turn of the forest trail, through every bush that Ivan's feet trudged through, he would not let go.\n\nAt long last, Ivan's feet gave. He collapsed, sending Dmitry tumbling through the ground, with dirt and rocks striking his face and body. He felt his wound open, as the bandages that held him together tore itself apart. Sound, noises, voices. Footsteps through the ground, noises of guns, voices of gruff men in foreign languages cloud his ephemeral mind. As he passed out from this world to the next, he heard gunfire and saw muzzle flashes out of the corner of his eye. In his final moments, he smiled; Ivan was not going quietly. He faded away, his consciousness crumbling like dust in the winter-kissed forests of Siberia."
 MAG.19.a: "Such is the cost of defeat."
 MAG.20.t: "A Haven of Our Own"
 MAG.20.desc: "WerBell stumbled out of the door, drunk. They had hit the jackpot. Matkovsky was out there, somewhere, probably skulking in the shadows but out of the picture nonetheless. Rodzaevsky was dead, with his madness buried six-feet deep in the ground along with his body. All over the former RFP stronghold of Magadan, partying had begun. Soldiers and local talents alike mingled with the crowd, and alcohol flowed freely from the pubs to the offices of the commanders. WerBell drank his fill, and he gulped it deeply. He had won, and to the victor goes the spoils. Or the swills, in his case.\n\nIn the next room over, the rest of his officers convened, their voices like indistinct bangs and thuds against the wooden wall. Sometimes he could hear a word or two emerge from the discussion, but his whiskey-addled mind soaked every last bit with liquor, and every phrase slid drowsily into his brain. No matter. He could trust his officers; they were loyal to more than their paycheck. If it had been the regular bread-and-butter mercenaries, he would have howled at them and shot his revolver all over the room.\n\nHe looked at the tea-colored substance lying in wait in the shot glass on the table, inviting him to take it for a single sip. Maybe he can. Maybe not. Better not to take the risk. Tonight was a fateful night. His neighbors were making history.\n\nThe door creaked open. \"Sir?\" One of his officers said, \"We have an important question.\"\n\n\"Spit it out already,\" WerBell said, growing impatient, \"This whiskey's mighty tempting.\"\n\n\"We have nailed the specific nature of the... Republic, sir. There is only one question left, and I think you should answer it. It's about the name.\"\n\nWerBell stood up, his hands poised for a theatrical and grandiose display. He said, almost at the top of his lungs, \"We're west from Alaska,\" toppling from his feet, catching himself up in the last second, \"West ALASKA!\"\n\nThe officer blinked at him. \"Excellent choice, sir.\""

 MAG.40.t: "The Enforcer"
 MAG.40.desc: "Even by the standards of the Far East, this was a shitty bar. The floors creaked at the slightest movement, and the beer tasted like bear piss. There wasn't even plumbing, and yet this was WerBell's choice for a meeting place. Alexander Pavlov was decidedly unimpressed. Matkovsky, his old boss, had taken great care to manage his image, all for the benefit of the Americans. Now the Americans were here, and they behaved like pigs. Even now the mercenaries were busy stinking up the bar with their ugly accents and drunken hooliganism. The only thing keeping him here was the fact that Pavlov's transition from the orderly world of fascism to the chaotic, pecuniary land of the new Far East had not exactly been smooth; he needed word, and badly. He resolved, perhaps unwisely, to hear WerBell out.\n\nWhen the mercenary captain sat down at the table at last, thirty minutes behind schedule, Pavlov straightened his posture self-consciously and gave his greeting. \"Mr. WerBell, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. As you're no doubt aware, I served under the previous administration as the Vozhd's top man in matters of internal security, and you'll find in short order that I am quite professional, should you choose to entrust me with such matters.\"\n\nWerBell met his offer with complete silence. Pavlov thought at first that this was contemplation, before realizing that the mercenary's eyes were completely uncomprehending. Oh, dear lord. The man barely understood Russian. WerBell pulled one of the other mercenaries over to the table and beckoned to Pavlov to continue. The rest of the negotiations progressed with the other man clumsily interpreting in his slightly less bad Russian, and they proved surprisingly fruitful. Clearly, the Americans had a deficit of loyal locals, and Pavlov was more than happy to fill it."

 magreg.35.t: "Medals of Dishonor"
 magreg.35.desc: "Yuri Vitvitsky sat on the hill overlooking the bustling port of Magadan, and reflected on how much his life had changed. On the decision he had made, earlier that morning.\n\nHe had, in his older age, decided to fight for Russia, for the idea that his homeland could, one day, be made whole again. But this had not always been the case. He had, in the past, served a very different master indeed. One that he now opposed in every sense of the word.\n\nThe Empire of Japan had once promised much, and he had not had the experience, the knowledge or, he now realized, the desire to see the insidious purpose in everything they did. It had taken him a long time not only to understand that, but also to accept it. To accept how misled he had been. How, in truth, he had not wanted to see.\n\nReaching into his jacket, he withdrew a small container, and opened it to inspect the contents. Medals. The 'rewards' of long and commendable service to an Empire that did not, had not ever, truly had any respect for him. He had been a tool. But no longer.\n\nWith one last thought of confirmation, Yuri drew his arm back and threw the container as hard as he could, watching as it tumbled end-over-end and, finally, struck the water, sinking below the surface. Behind that spot, he could see a large cargo ship moving towards a pier, no doubt carrying materiel for the state's reunification efforts. The contrast, to Yuri, was striking.\n\nHe had a new master. One he could believe in. One who could show his old one the foolishness of their goals."

 magreg.36.desc: "Trofim had not, in his wildest dreams, ever thought he would be wearing the uniform of a police officer.\n\nA longtime member of the Russian Fascist Party, he had spent many years escaping from or avoiding capture by the police of various states. As such, when he had first heard that the Blackshirts were being reformed into a police force, he had thought it a joke. He quickly realized that, as was always the case when the Vozhd proclaimed a change, it was no joke.\n\nAt first, he had not liked the change, though he would not have dared to voice that thought. In the Blackshirts, he had been used to doing what was necessary, without much thought to legal regulations. That was no longer the case. And, yet, he found that he did not mind the rules as much as he once had. Because they allowed him to realize something he had always wanted: acceptance.\n\nWhen people passed him on the street now, after the initial period of distrust of course, they no longer regarded him with constant suspicion and fear. After he had worked to capture some low-level criminals, some had even taken to greeting him. He liked that feeling. He liked feeling that, on some level, he was helping people as he helped his country towards its natural destiny.\n\nHe liked that. And he gave thanks to the Vozhd for the opportunity."
 magreg.36.a: "A surprising change of heart."
 magreg.37.t: "Way the Wind Blows"
 magreg.37.desc: "Former Captain of the Pacific Fleet Dimitri Kirlenko was an old man. He had enlisted in the Soviet Navy when he was a young man and had risen through the ranks with the enthusiasm that could not be matched. When he was first made captain he had been given command of the Rykov-class Cruiser Kalinin. He had fallen in love with that ship, she had been his first and his last command.\n\nWhen the Great Patriotic War came to a close and the Presidium fled to Irkutsk, he had served admirably against the IJN in its last offensive. When Admiral Yumashev took the fleet to Kamchatka he had personally ensured the cohesion of his task force. The Fleet's fall to the Father and Magadan had been the last straw for many of his fellow sailors. Those who didn't find work with the new regional hegemon found themselves drifting and drowning their sorrows in booze.\n\nAs Dimitri looked out at the docked merchant ships in the Port of Magadan he thought about his situation. The new rulers of the Far East turned his stomach. He was forced to do things he had regretted in order to keep the Kalinin and her sisters afloat, but even he could not find it in himself to be generous towards members of the Russian Fascist Party. Looking out towards the horizon he contemplated once again whether or not he should leave the country. Perhaps he would take charter passage on a trade ship to America, or go west deeper into the former Union.\n\nHe wondered whether his old friend Admiral Yumashev would approve of the Siberian National Republic and what it stood for. Would he begrudge his decision to abandon his homeland for greener shores? Would he support him staying in this new country? In truth, he knew it didn't matter. It would all come down to his own decision at the end. Dimitri looked out over the waters of his homeland for one more time, taking in the salt air and the sound of the dockworkers. With tears pooling in the corner of his eyes, he walked to the end of the docks. There was a ship there accepting passengers to the United States."

 magreg.38.t: "Starting Fresh"
 magreg.38.desc: "A glass was raised at a table in San Francisco, silencing the indistinct voices speaking in Russian, who looked up expectantly. \"I propose a toast,\" The man holding the glass announced. \"To America, to the liberation of Russia, and most of all, to the ruination of the Germans!\" Glasses clinked together as cheers went out, and as the dinner party continued with renewed energy, Matkovsky thought that his new life here might not be so bad. True, he still thought that the sooner WerBell choked on his own spit and went to hell, the better off the world would be. Nevertheless, he found he was almost coming to enjoy his time in this great American city of San Francisco. It reminded him of Harbin, almost, and filled him with a nostalgia for those simpler days almost enough to drown out his bitterness over his forced exile. Almost.\n\nThe rest of the émigrés here were quite agreeable and had helped him to get settled in, and in the years since WerBell's thrice-damned takeover, he had become something of a leader to them, hosting widely popular parties and celebrations for the community. Sadly, not many seemed very convinced of fascism, so whatever hopes he had once had of retaking Magadan and giving WerBell his just reward for betrayal quickly evaporated.\n\nStill, this America was quite a nice land, and the regard in which the émigrés held him allowed him to still enjoy some semblance of the power he had once held, so he tried not to dwell on crushed hopes and past adventures. Perhaps, Matkovsky thought, he should write a book, and hope that the next generation or the generation after might finally realize the fascist ideal."

 petlin.11.desc: "A stiff wind blew as Vitaly slowly but surely made his way towards the door, shivering and wrapping his arms around himself. He was here. He was really here again. After all that time he had spent wasting away in Dalstroy, all that time spent praying death would come for him just a moment sooner. At long last, he was returning to the only place that still mattered to him.\n\nHome.\n\nIt was strange, really, how it had become such an unfamiliar word to him. So long he had spent not daring to speak about it, only barely chancing to think of it on occasion, as though afraid showing too much attachment might condemn them to the same fate. Them. His family. Oh, God, his family. How much had changed in the time he had been away? Would they recognize him? Did they even remember him?\n\nOne, two, three knocks on the door, then he lowered his hand, anxiously waiting for a response. Even a 'go away' would suffice. He just wanted to know that they were alive. Finally, after a short time that felt like forever, the door swung open. \"Hello, what can I do for-\" The woman who had opened the door gasped, her eyes going wide, as though she had seen a ghost. She may as well have. Oh, how he had missed his wife. Did Sofia still love him, he wondered, as he still loved her?\n\nPast her, Vitaly could see two teenagers walking up, confused as to the commotion. His son, Valentin, and his daughter, Anna. He locked eyes with the former, the older of the two. The boy's face was an eerie reflection of his own, young against old, curious against cautious, fearless against fearful. Had he looked like that, before? What had before been like? He could not remember.\n\nSo, instead, he smiled and said the only thing he could."

The thin patches of snow had given way to the budding green grasses of early spring, the buzzing of the bees hummed along the windowpanes of the car, losing their song in the clang and din of the engines. Petlin almost dozed off, and the route home wasn't even that long. Lydia was waiting there. Finally, for the first time in years, they may have peace. Free from tyrants, from false messiahs, and enemies - a quiet, after years of screaming and chaos.\n\nPeople waved to his car as it passed by. Some spat. The evening cast long shadows over the fences and bales of hay, and the final patches of cold dissolved under the somnolent gaze of the setting sun. Petlin sat back, letting the cushions of his seat absorb his weight. He looked at his watch. Still a few minutes before home is in sight. He closed his eyes and let sleep take him. The car juddered and shook, but after a day of work, it made for no finer bed. Petlin smiled at the thought of the evening. Friends, comrades, and his wife at the hearth, as warmth promises to wash over the cold that had submerged them."

Vlasov replied.\n\nMorrison looked at Starostin.\n\n'The city of Krasnoyarsk has fallen on hard times, and the sports team is no exception,' the economic minister said, 'If you invest, even to something as ephemeral as sports, it'll go a long way to getting the city back on track to being one of the greatest industrial cities in Siberia.'\n\nAnother pause followed as Morrison considered the city's value, and the team.\n\n'We'll start at a hundred grand a month. If the team shows signs of improving after three, I'll increase it to two.'\n\nThe room muttered in agreement as the two ministers parted the room together. It was important for a new nation like Siberia to get as many powerful allies as it could. While sports may seem trivial, that businessmen were willing to invest in a field like this was a sign that much closer ties to the US would be made in the coming months."

Cancer had come to him, throbbing, pulsating within his belly, a tide of pain that scarcely any painkiller could stem. His new doctors had suggested trips to America. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy - or whatever the hogwash it is these days - could help. Not now. A Vozhd of the Russians should rule from Russian soil, and not delegate his tasks to subordinates while he cavorts with foreigners on strange shores.\n\nMatkovsky inclined his head to the window beside his bed. The snow was falling, layering the frigid air in a cloak of white. Grains of it tossed and turned to the wind's whims, and a hollow rasp whistled as it brushed against the palace's walls. He closed his eyes and listened. Far below, in the kitchen, the voices of the maids and servants raised in curious gossip became indistinct whispers punctuated by shrill notes of laughter. Above, the wooden planks of the attic creaked as they moved Matkovsky's old possessions there. The gramophone, personal mementos, and the stack of Russian marching songs, preserved in perfect record.\n\nHe sat up. The pain was intense, and he gritted his teeth. Swinging his feet to the side, he prepared to stand. One hand on the bedpost, he lifted himself, straining against the mass of shock that seemed to emanate from nowhere. Yet, he did not scream. Then, the Vozhd stood in his opulent bedroom, his knees about to give way under the weight of the agony. Matkovsky took a deep breath and started to walk. He could use a drink."

Eschewing the naming conventions in Russia, he has taken to naming his new homeland after the region closest to his old one: West Alaska.\n\nHowever, the new Republic needs to establish itself in this foreign land. The mercenary army shall reinforce the regions of Amur and Magadan, to root out any fascist opposition against us in the area.

We have to shoot the stars with a bullet left in the cartridge.

Without ideological support and only guarded by local militiamen and outlaws brought over with the promises of high pay, Yakutia will not be much of a challenge.

Holding some lofty ideas, as young men are often prone to, Sablin claimed a radio tower amid Buryatia and proclaimed his ambitions: to unify Russia and restore the Soviet Union. Yagoda was not pleased by this and declared Sablin and his ilk revisionists.\n\nHowever, their ideological split does not matter to us.

WerBell personally could not stand what he sees as the stagnation inherent within this system.\n\nThis must change. We will disband all the institutions of communism in Irkutsk. No more communism; only capitalism. All that reside there will discover a new, better way of life: the American lifestyle. To live, one must work, innovate, and interact with the market.

The people of Buryatia loves Sablin and his ideology, willing to die for his dream of a union of the proletariat, hearkening back to the times of Lenin and the old Revolution.\n\nHowever, what he had made was not a nation of soldiers, but dreamers.

We project that we will be meeting very little resistance on our way to defeat the town. However, as is the case with Yakutsk, the primary issue is not that of difficulty, but time.

However, by relying on these, Alexander Men has made a crucial mistake: all it needs to shatter his base of support is to win over their hearts and minds.\n\nIt boils down to that, then: a war of propaganda. From our radio stations in Magadan, we shall shout for the liberation of the Far East from the tyranny of that heretic.

There lies our problem: there are not enough of us to keep the peasants from breaking through sections of the front left unguarded.\n\nIf we let them continue as they please, they will whittle us down to nothing. WerBell has no plan prepared for his loss, however. The answer to his predicament lies in acting in complete contradiction to the enemy's expectations: he shall attack. By making quick, decisive strikes against the weak parts of their lines, we can overwhelm them and isolate their divisions, neutralizing any threats they may have.

 MAG_WA_rule_like_a_caesar_desc: "Through sheer perseverance and luck, WerBell has gained the possession of his homeland from the treacherous fascists and communists that infested the Far East. Many have condemned his reign over the peoples of this stretch of Russia as dictatorial and iron-fisted, expecting democracy to follow in the wake of the American-aided army. It is not to be so. If there is no one to seize power, WerBell reasons, it shall find itself seized - and he cannot allow that risk. Though the plebians may jeer, it is ultimately in their favor that he takes the reins of chaos.\n\nThe Republic shall make no political promises to the local civilians. Let them mock and let them revolt: for those who bear their crosses must carry them in silence. Better to live a day as a lion than to spend eternity as sheep."

 MAG_WA_illiberalism_by_necessity_desc: "Although it is unfortunate, it must be admitted that the situation in Russia does not permit the political freedoms that Americans enjoy. Although WerBell's heart bleeds for Russians, for his cause to triumph, he must rally Russians from all the political classes behind him. He can allow no dissent, no gap in his resolve to save Russia from the destitution within which she now finds herself. It is a pragmatic solution: when WerBell's term as dictator expires, the Republic shall put its utmost effort towards the expansion of this freedom.\n\nHowever, for now, a certain amount of political curtailment is necessary. WerBell's state agencies shall scan through newspapers, radio broadcasts, and media that the Russian people consume to find any sign of displeasure and rebellion. Only through control and restraint can peace find her way into Russia again."

 MAG_WA_integrating_the_nkvd_desc: "When one speaks of the NKVD to the Russian locals, the surest reaction that it will elicit is a groan. Infamous for their authoritarian practices to keep order and conformity towards the communist orthodoxy, they might be a tool through which WerBell and his Republic may halt dissent. The President himself is not a communist - but in these wastes, no one can afford to be dogmatic. An alternative would be using the Russian Fascist thugs. However, if there is anything the local despises more than the NKVD, it is the RFP.\n\nShould WerBell decide to integrate the NKVD, the Republic shall re-train them to be a vital asset of the state. They will be given police ranks and the duty of keeping the rearguard while WerBell's soldiers fight in the frontlines. The NKVD, although it is brutal, is a lesser evil compared to the RFP. WerBell is a mercenary - he is in the business of choosing lesser evils."

Although the fate of Matkovsky remains unknown as of yet, his and Rodzaevsky's party are left without a guiding hand. Languishing in prisons throughout the Far East, these brutal thugs and party functionaries await only a leader to call them into action. To restore order, the Republic might need their help after all. The other choice would be the NKVD - and that decision is another can of worms on its own.\n\nIf the President decides to use the Blackshirts instead of the NKVD, he will give them a unilateral pardon and a stern warning. While he wages war to restore Russia as one again, these men would have the duty of keeping order in domestic affairs. Although fascism is contrary to the ideals of the Republic, one must occasionally choose the lesser evil."

 MAG_WA_executive_orders_desc: "As a citizen of the United States of America, WerBell does not like the idea of ruling by decree. Throughout generations, American democracy has sustained itself by careful usage of power and precedent. Although WerBell is President of West Alaska, he fears that any decrees that he passes is grounds for a future dictator to abuse the authority that he would give to himself.\n\nHowever, this is no time to be cowardly. If there is no one to seize power, someone eventually will. The people of Russia do not have the American luxury of an easy life that they can take for granted. In a fight for survival, no one can afford to hold back. The people of West Alaska may be unhappy, but this is the only solution. Caesar saved the masses of Rome, not through concern for their liberty, but for their well-being. Disappointed they may be, but live they shall."

However, sometimes, it may take extreme measures to ensure that order is kept and that his rule is safe from interlopers and usurpers. He wants the peoples of the Far East and Russia to share in his triumphs, to be happy as he is happy, to suffer as he suffers for the nation. Yet, even when one is as benevolent and open-handed as one can, one may not stop the evil intentions that brew in the dank corners of a man's heart.\n\nFear is as legitimate a tool as love. When adoration and adulation have failed, the government must resort to the implementation of deterrence as a policy. Severe punishment for crimes, infiltration of local communities by the ex-NKVD police, everything that can be done, shall be done in the name of order and fear. The government prefers itself loved; if that fails, it has no qualms with using fear."

 MAG_WA_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc: "In a region with so many ethnic and cultural variations as the Far East, flexibility is key. WerBell's previous decisions have rendered this path open to him. The carrot or the stick: the Far Eastern people are free to follow our directives or to disobey them. If they choose the former, we shall reward them and promote them as their deeds have seen them fit. If they choose the latter, then they shall be liable to punishment within the criminal code.\n\nAbove all, the government shall attempt to distance itself from the civilian population. Using the previously-appointed police forces, we shall enact punishment. The Republic's civilian bodies shall reward those that perform their duties with exceptional skill. Never say that WerBell is an ungrateful man - he rewards those who deserve it and punishes those that have been failing."

Though the locals of this place may tolerate our rule, they can never fully accept a stranger ruling from their midst. They are not our friends - the relationship is strictly professional, and now, we pose the question: are you with us or against us?\n\nWe are not here to serve them, as the government of the United States serves its people. When one's duty is salvation, there can be scarce little left in the way of compromise."

 MAG_WA_a_loyal_legislature_desc: "In our previous attempts at establishing a semblance of control over the Far Eastern territories, we have encountered the bureaucracy of this place. Byzantine, made out of patchwork legal territories that could scarcely be called a nation. Although the situation has settled down, there remains a significant discrepancy, especially in regards to fascist and communist standards. The fascist and communist bureaucracy often do not agree on much - one uses the Imperial system, the other uses metric, for example.\n\nAs a solution to this, the Republic shall promulgate new laws that standardize the differences endemic to the bureaucratic system. From this patchwork of standards, we shall fashion the fabric of a new bureaucracy: a smooth and gliding citizen service that serves its people well."

To do so, we will divide the state into regions and appoint a commander to each one.\n\nThese commanders will be chosen from the ranks of our best - and most loyal - men. In this way, we will be sure of their commitment to the goals of the state, rather than any of their own."

 MAG_WA_representation_through_service_desc: "It is no secret that the average mercenary under the employ of the President has a better life than the majority of the Russian locals. In addition to better standards of living, political and voting rights, they have a steady source of employment that is sure to provide for them. The locals, of either flavor, envy the merc life. The Republic's laws are stiff, and there is not much room for social mobility - a discrepancy that would not have existed in America, where every man is free to be whatever he wants.\n\nPatterning his government on his home country's model, WerBell aims to fix this. He has a solution that will remedy the Republic's personnel shortage, as well as reassuring the restive locals: representation through service. Now, native Russians can sign up for a tour in WerBell's army and be granted more rights as they complete their term of employment. If they can shoot straight, why bar them from progressing their careers?"

 MAG_WA_drawing_the_districts_desc: "Although the Republic may suspend democracy for the time being, it may not remain that way forever. Whether he is a Caesar or Cincinnatus, WerBell must eventually turn to answering the question of the people. Where do they stand in the Republic? Is the Republic a manner of dictatorship where the stated political rights are restricted indefinitely? These questions bubble in the thoughts of the Far Eastern Russians, who saw the unlikeliest of all candidates triumph over the fascists and communists.\n\nTo answer their anxieties, the Republic will make some headway to accepting democracy as its form of government. It will enter a preparatory stage - we will draw districts, establish voting booths, and devolve some governmental authorities to the municipalities and cities. We can complete the process, but not now. War stands on our gates, as the Central Siberians triumph over their own conflicts. Victory is greater than freedom."
 MAG_WA_a_legal_path_to_collaboration: "A Legal Path to Collaboration"
 MAG_WA_a_legal_path_to_collaboration_desc: "The Republic has loosened its standards regarding service, but the question still stands: what about collaboration? The truth is that the Republic cannot function as a state without the help of collaborators. From its bureaucracy to its police force, the Russians who willingly submitted themselves to WerBell's rule form the backbone and sinew of the newborn nation. Were it not for the help of these people, we would be nowhere. As a consequence, their status in society is a gray area.\n\nOne way to solve this quandary is to legitimize their position. Allowing more Russians into the civil service, as well as passing laws that confirm their legal status in society, would go a long towards soothing the restive ambitions of the Russian collaborators. The mercenaries will not like this, of course - but is the Republic not a state of, by, and for the Russian people?"

Those brave men and women that answered WerBell's call and hailed from across the world to heed his rallying cry, those who have been with him since the beginning. Those who deserve the world, those who hold up their part of the sky - and what can we give them but the adoration they deserve? If it were not for these brave pioneers, the Republic of West Alaska, the shining beacon of liberty amid a wasteland of dictatorships, might have never existed at all.\n\nNow is not the time for doubt. We shall issue more calls, more cries of rallying spirit, to gather those homeless in their home nations and to give them a reason to live, to fight for. The locals and collaborators might not like this - however, as WerBell often says, fuck them. If we are to triumph, we can make no compromises."

The United States of Russia, with its sister republic across the Bering Strait, has risen to the duty of salvation of the Russian people. Soon, democracy shall make its way to the people who have not known rule by popular will, and for that, we have one man to thank: Mitchell WerBell III.\n\nIn his presidential palace in Magadan, where he rules by the will of the peoples of the Far East, he drinks a glass of wine, cheerful. To the west lay Central Siberia: a far stronger foe than any of the statelets that he had faced in his progress to power.

President WerBell knows all too well the value of the free market, and believes that the time has come for it to return to Russia.\n\nInspired by our American partners, we shall institute an open door policy regarding international trade.

These weapons are now gathering dust in various warehouses and abandoned arsenals dotting the country, and procuring them will be necessary to make sure each and every one of our soldiers of fortune have a rifle in their hands.\n\nOf course, many of these weapons are likely to be outdated, but this matters little. Our men are the kind who are used to making do with what they have, and aren't the type to scoff at a rifle that doesn't have all the fancy bells and whistles most modern armies are used to.

If we want to draw further investment and business from around the globe, we will need a port worthy of the world's attention.

If we do not take action soon our army is in danger of being overwhelmed by a type of enemy it is not prepared to fight.\n\nSiberia's landscape is as hostile as it is unique, and in many ways it is the perfect place for small groups of insurgents to hide from a larger foe.

Currently our largest air bases are what remain from before the collapse of the Soviet Union with a few halfhearted expansions and modernizations thrown in. Some of these facilities have great potential to be combat bases for our new air force, and one in particular, known as Cheryomushki, is a prime candidate to serve as the new headquarters. Lying to the west of Chita, it is far enough from the front lines to be safe, but not so far that our pilots could not reach the fighting on time."

After the collapse of the Soviet Union the waters of the Sea of Okhotsk became a modern hotbed of piracy, and though the worst of the pirates are long gone, a few of the stragglers remain active. To the south lies the Empire of Japan, the strongest naval power in the world and a nation we have a chilly relationship with at best. While we have no delusions of opposing their naval dominance, we must not concede control of the sea to them without a fight.\n\nTo this end, a small, modern, and combat ready navy must be established. Though it will be stuck in port during the winter months and mostly be used for coastal patrols when it can operate, it will still be a powerful symbol of Russia's revival and our commitment to creating a nation strong enough to defend itself."

With the foundation of the United States of Siberia, it seems that she has bequeathed a home for her followers.\n\nThe Western Russians station their troops outside our borders, outnumbering us in equipment, division count, and personnel.

With this came the development of political ideologies perhaps not seen elsewhere in the Western world. Anarchism, thought long dead, still has followers in Kansk. Novosibirsk and Tomsk, anti-theses of each other, were within a stone's throw of each other. These varieties might seem interesting to the historian, but for the administrators of the Republic, this is a nightmare.\n\nTo pacify the Great Giant, the Republic of West Alaska shall use a carrot-and-stick approach.

The Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay came the closest, but its focus on the corporations have drawn disgust and ire from even the most freedom-loving American. With economic freedom must come personal freedom: this, in WerBell's eyes, has always been the American way.\n\nTherefore, there must be a rejuvenation of the economy under American principles if the United States of Siberia were to prosper.

The Siberian constitution should contain the same principles.\n\nFirst, life. Everyone has a right to live, that much is clear. Second, liberty. Through freedom of enterprise, we seek to give personal freedom to every Siberian that participates within the market.

While America created states based purely off of geographic and political considerations, Russia is a little different. While we'll be creating states based off of geographical parameters as well, Siberia has the unique reality of vastly different minorities spread throughout her territories.

But just because we don't blame them doesn't mean we can tolerate their simmering dissent.\n\nOnce more we must look to our friends in America for inspiration! WerBell and his cabinet have decided to create the Strategic Services Unit, or SSU, to root out dissenters and would-be revolters in our newly-conquered Siberian territories, in order to \"discourage\" any potential actions against our government.

Most of the people we can rely on are mercenaries - soldiers at heart. And a good soldier does not a bureaucrat make.

The fact that our army is primarily made up of foreign mercenaries with few prospects of raising a mass force has made our high command acutely aware of our precarious position.\n\n\"Fear not\", our daring leader has reassured us, \"There's an art to living dangerously\". We don't need a massive army, claims WerBell. Our mercenaries have served us well up to this point, and why should that change?

While we've until this point relied on our foreign mercenaries, the upcoming western conflict will require just more than ambitious foreigners.\n\nIf we can train anyone from around the world to be an elite soldier, why can't we train a Russian? It's time to create employment opportunities in our armed forces for natives - not just to fill ranks, but to become truly elite soldiers, on par with those who we've attracted from abroad.

Like us, our western neighbour has fought tooth and nail to get where they are. They have a large industrial base, a large population base, and an army that's been fighting for years.\n\nSimply put, it's not practical to rely purely on American aid to supply our soldiers anymore.

 westalaska.3.desc: "Nancy Wake was not unaccustomed to the conduct of espionage. She sat in her new office, formerly owned by the RFP member Nikolay Petlin, whereabouts unknown, receiving reports and issuing orders. Her duty was that of a spider - to construct webs of informants, local contacts, and spies: in the hopes of snaring a valuable piece of intel, or perhaps even a snitch or two. Her mind is tuned to the changes in the web, just like how a spider can feel any snag, any object that caught itself in its structure. This morning, her mind polished in the bitter wash of coffee, she had received a report from Firebase Moses: and it did not disappoint her. Cocooned in a file before her, was what she had wanted all along: juicy, valuable intel.\n\nShe could feel the venom emanate from this particular document, however. Firebase Moses had seen activities in the north, although it hadn't coalesced into anything concrete. All reports of civilian movement seemed inconclusive - tracking the cursory, sub-sensory flow of people to the barren north was pointless, not to mention exhausting and taxing. Opening the file, she rustled through its contents: hastily written notes, blurry photographs, and a word that echoed over and over: the Father, the Father. She leaned back in her chair and considered her options. The newly-installed telephone sat across from her. If she lifted the receiver, then the equivalent in WerBell's office would also ring.\n\nWithout a doubt, she reached for it."

 westalaska.4.desc: "Smith looked over the pitiful port of Magadan, a few planks for rotten wood jutting out to the cold, brackish waters of the North Pacific. On the other side of that ocean is heaven on earth: the United States of America. Land of freedom and liberty, of countless land and infinite money. Smith, from his days and nights in the city of Bloemfontein, had seen America from the covers of magazines, and the brief, barely-legible photographs of monochrome newspapers. War was a business, and business was good, yes; but he did not want to shoot at natives forever. No: he had dreams beyond, to settle in America, and finally end a roaming, sedentary life.\n\nAs images of kitschy glitz fluttered in his mind - of paperback romance books, of the descriptions of one shining city after another, he saw the ship bearing new arrivals to WerBell's latest scheme. No doubt, its occupants held the same kind of dreams that Smith had: to settle down somewhere quiet, somewhere where they could enjoy the winnings of a life spent on betting against fate and coming on top, again and again.\n\nSmith would rather be in the frontlines right about now, where the days passed quickly. An assignment is still an assignment, however, and at least there was pay. He had to watch over the soldiers, and guide them to their new quarters, guide them through the modest town, and generally help them acclimate. He went over his own words in his mind: the greetings, the jokes, and how he would handle and juggle especially inflated egos.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and took a drag. He'd play it by ear, fuck it. His future problems were for his future self. For now, he enjoyed the small luxury afforded to him and made a joke to his past, something only he would ever know. He laughed and watched as the vessel ambled its way through the waves, coming ever closer by the minute."

For the past hour, he had loaded and unloaded bullets into it, spinning the chamber, and playing with the safety, all from the comfort of his arm. The boy, an aide of age nineteen, tried to dissuade him from doing, in a pussy's parlance, \"rash actions.\" WerBell might be drunk, but he knew what the fuck he was doing.\n\n\"N-no, sieur,\" the boy's French accent bled into everything, staining his words with a tang of wine, bread, and croissant. Or something like that. WerBell was a stream-of-consciousness guy, especially when he was drunk. \"Though, I have read stuff in the newspapers and magazines. I think that it's a fair country,\" the boy looked down, \"at least compared to France.\"\n\nWerBell roared with laughter. The aide looked at him with puzzlement, and then growing offense. Before the young man could say anything, however, WerBell cut him short with a quick chamber-snap of the revolver. \"Those magazines don't tell you anything about the full picture,\" the mercenary clambered down from the heights, \"They don't tell you jack shit about America. Land of the free, land of liberty, land of opportunity. You can find damn near everything there, except maybe the fun of merc life.\" He took a sip of his whiskey, finally putting his gun to its holster, \"Save up. Save the fuck up. You're young - twenty-one, right? Maybe there you'll find the girl of your dreams, and settle down in a nice farm somewhere in Texas. Or something like that.\"\n\nThe aide could do nothing but nod.

The perpetrator has been court-martialed and punished according to the Provisional Military Code of West Alaska. It happened after an altercation between Genrikh Yagoda and said recruit. The latter was tired and exhausted after a day of \"cleaning up after the mess of the NKVD.\" Having lived under the regime of Genrikh Yagoda, the private attempted to reason with the dictator and acquire a motive for his \"cruel, inhumane\" reign in the Far East. Distressed at the loss of his fiefdom to what he termed to be \"a bunch of mercenary troublemakers,\" the former President of the Presidium attempted to leverage his protection under the Code and his higher education against the recruit to justify what he euphemistically called \"the excesses of socialism.\"\n\nThis did not go well. After a brief round of intellectual sparring, which the tired Russian recruit found to be annoying to the highest extreme, he fired at Yagoda, killing him after a few shots from his (now-secured) M1911. As it stands, with all parties satisfied with the outcome, with the Russian punished and Yagoda gone, here are the Examiner's recommendations:\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate burial or cremation."

A scarce few days before, the Government of West Alaska had sentenced Valery Sablin, former commissar of the NKVD, to death. Now, he sat with the de-facto dictator of the nation - the latter puffing fumes from his cigar like the smokestacks of overworked factories.\n\n\"Yes,\" Sablin said, in the most baffled tone he could manage, \"Why am I here?\" When his guards told him that he was meeting WerBell, he believed that he would be marched like lambs to the slaughter, to stand before the gun barrel of a ruthless mercenary and hunted down without mercy. Instead, he found himself before a polished plate, with a lustrous steak flanked by silverware. Far from the dark basements of the Magadan prisons, this dining room was well-lit, a chandelier hanging above, its beads shining like little glassy stars.\n\n\"We're just here to have dinner in peace, from man to man,\" WerBell said, \"A final goodbye.\" A mercenary draped in the trappings of a waiter poured red wine to Sablin's glass. \"Want a cigar, Mr. Sablin? Although - maybe you don't know how to smoke one of these yet.\" WerBell smiled at Sablin, a look free of malice and ill-intent, a steel facade worn over an evil face. When he found the commissar staring at him with a mix of befuddlement and disgust, he tipped his glass over in Sablin's direction. \"Come on, Mr. NKVD. The wine isn't that bad.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, thanks,\" Sablin said, \"I would rather suffer the indignity of imprisonment than being entreated and brought over to the side of an enemy of socialism.\"\n\nWerBell laughed again. \"Who says you were going to live? Mr. Sablin, you are twenty-three at most. Live a little.\" He coughed, \"Before you die, that is.\" He gestured his fork at Sablin. \"Go on, dig in.\" He drank his wine and ate his food, not paying attention to the commissar at all, who did not touch his plate. He left WerBell's presence as resigned of his fate as before, although a part of him wondered what the mercenary truly was."

In his head pounded the noisiest headache known to man - he shouldn't have drunk anything before today. His grip on his pen was slippery, and his grasp on reality equally as magnificent. Putting his pen down, he cracked his fingers together and stretched, triggering an avalanche pain in his head as the cranks of his shoulder administer their punishment. Every tremor of his head, every twitch of the eye, seemed to shake and break reality around him.\n\nIn front of him was the mother of all documents he had to ever write. He liked to pretend that in his alcohol-induced waking nightmare that the black trails of ink were pearls of wisdom, shining in the dark. The other part of him called it bullshit. The sum of himself, the part that thought the chair was too big, believed the latter. Sometimes one must lie for the truth to shine on - another piece of bullshit.\n\nA doorknock. \"Are you done,\" the voice of the fearful French aide said, \"Sir?\" WerBell decided against replying. His throat was parched, and whatever sound that emanated from it, no mortal human being can ever withstand. He could do with a glass of warm water, but no, \"Constitution first, sir.\" Damned French and their constitutions; what do they know about running nations? Two Empires, three republics, and a country that was sunk into the clutches of Fascism.\n\nHe grumbled, he complained, he shuddered and shivered. Sighing, he admitted that it would probably need to be done sooner or later. He peered down on the great sheet of paper and saw that he only just got unto \"Minority Protections\".

They gave him food - not rotting, bottom-of-the-barrel food, but actual, edible meals. Even after their tribunals sentenced him to death by firing squad, they did not stop the special treatment. The Father, Alexander Men, took everything they gave him with a pinch of salt. Gifts from human beings can never surpass the grace of the Lord. Holding it close to his heart, he accepted that his fate was to suffer in the clutches of soft mercy. He fasted, he refused to wear his attire - preferring instead to wear the threadbare, drab wear of the other prisoners.\n\nToday, however, was different. They forced him, first softly, later almost at gunpoint, to wear his clerical robes. The guards said that their master, the deplorable and reviled mercenary, Mitchell WerBell III, sought to meet him, and confess. The remark alone stunned him, not to mention its repercussions. He was not even sure if WerBell was baptized in the Orthodox rite. His men discussed his Russian descent, but surely not? He debated the question until they brought him before WerBell.\n\n\"I have nothing to say to you,\" Men said, \"And I doubt that your intent to confess was ever pure.\" He resisted the urge to spit before his tribulation, the punishment for his failed trial. The two men stood and stared at one another before WerBell started,\n\n\"Come on, Father,\" WerBell flashed a smirk at the agitated Father, \"I am irreligious. I just want to talk. To see how a man of God views my career. Perhaps even,\" he paused. \"A blessing.\" He continued. \"I like to believe that I had been merciful in my youthful pursuit. Industrious, in the art of war, and an enthusiastic practitioner of the Lord's gift resolving conflicts with violence.\" He thumbed his revolver. \"I am an arms dealer, and not just guns either. Men, tanks, artillery guns, the many things that render modern conflict possible.\" Stepping closer to the Father, \"I have committed many sins, Father, and I do not see a way to turn back.

Shells dotted the ground, and brick buildings lay there, shattered - their facade now scattered around them. In the distance, a half-sunk Parish overlooked the town, its bells hollow. An artillery strike had struck its tower, and the defenders had to watch as the building sagged and leaned, retreating quickly in fear of further fire. Survivors from both sides staggered through the ruin, seeking medical attention and food. A shrill cry sounded in the distance.\n\n\"What a mess,\" Nancy said, \"But I guess you are used to this, seeing as-\" she turned to see WerBell puffing a cigar, enjoying his time as if he was walking on his own backyard. \"It's nice to see that at least someone is enjoying this trip out in the woods.\" She glanced at a woman in white who hurried between the medical tents, carrying in her arms medical supplies and tools, as well as alcohol to clean wounds. Local medics. Thank god for them. It was her idea. Their mission had expanded exponentially, and now she was sitting in the front-seat to the most mind-boggling phenomenon in Russia. She sighed. Her stay would be longer than expected, after all.\n\nTaking his cigar out of his mouth, WerBell blew wisps of smoke that wafted about him like a fine mist. \"This may not look like it,\" he said, turning to Nancy, \"But we're saving these people. For god's sake,\" he kicked a mound of dirt in front of him, \"They can't even save themselves. Remember Germany?\" He smiled. \"We'll make soldiers out of them just yet,\" looking at two listless men who stood in front of the remnants of their house, their face emptied by disbelief, and filled with uncertainty, \"We'll give them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nMaybe coming here was a mistake.

Multiple sabotage events foiled, most importantly at the Irkutsk Hydro Plant. The last pages of the report were the most important, however.

Or, rather and as far as he was concerned, his 'army,' it barely being capable of being called such. The rabble that called themselves soldiers possessed no discipline and little understanding of basic field skills. The arms and other materiel they utilized were not only ancient and non-uniform, but also in terrible condition.\n\nWerBell had not lived so long, or secured his and his confederates' rule over the Far East by being sloppy, undisciplined, ill-equipped, or blind. No, he had secured it by taking charge. By putting in an honest day's toil of hard - and quality - work. Like any American would. Or should. And he would do the same here.\n\nLooking each of the officers he now walked past in the eye, he wondered if they knew what was about to be in store for them.

Apparently, they qualified him to train troops.\n\nIn stilted, broken Russian he began speaking to the trainees: \"H-Hello, good morning...\" Shit, what was the word for recruit? \"Students.\" The squad stared at him in utter confusion, but said nothing. Only silence reigned in the small field outside the barracks, save for the whistling of the siberian winds. Otto's heart beat faster as he floundered for the right words to give orders. Sweat was already collecting on his brow, beaten by freezing wind and leaving him with that agonizingly anachronistic feeling one gets on a cold, sunny day.\n\nLeaning to the side, one of the soldiers whispered to his mate, \"Go figure, the idiots send a kraut who can barely speak Russian to train us to fight so we can pretend to be American.\" The other recruit chuckled in response. Turning red with embarrassment at mockery he couldn't grasp, Otto tried helplessly to form a sentence that would tell them to shut their damn mouths.\n\n\"Quiet your faces! Today we will drill open-grass combat. Er- Open field. Open field combat.\" Otto dropped his cigarette, stamping it into the ground before shakily reaching for another one. At this point, the soldiers were barely holding back hysterical laughter, their lips puckered and their chins dug into their necks to avoid giggling.\n\n\"Christ above. Just uh... just run twenty lap, yes students?\" The squad nodded and began running down the small, gravel track they had dug the previous night.\n\nOne recruit shouted, \"Okay teacher!\" As he set off, snickering at his own joke.\n\nOtto went to sit down, lighting his second cigarette of the day."

As he walked along the docks, shuffling in between crowds of travellers, sailors and dock workers, he felt old wounds ache. The bullet in his foot he caught fighting for his country against the krauts. The scars and bullet wounds from his time roving in Algeria. The bullet in his other foot, his chest, and his shoulder he caught fighting for the krauts or some other sordid power with enough money to convince the old soldier to bleed again in some hellhole in the depths of Africa, for some few Reichsmarks and a lifetime of dull pain. The bullet that never left his right leg after his stint in the Italian Middle East, giving him a painful but difficult to notice limp. A thousand other skirmishes lingered in his memory but left no mark like that of those years in North Africa, Central Africa and the Middle East.\n\nStill, Roger was only slightly less able than he used to be, a fact that impressed his employers and drew him fame and renown. The 'Man of A Thousand Lives' they called him. So, when Roger heard a state in Russia was hiring mercenaries, and saw many people he had fought alongside flee to once again live the daring life of a hired gun, he'd decided to give it a shot.\n\nIt was an odd feeling, walking the streets of Magadan as he searched for a barracks, a hiring office, anywhere he could find a job. It felt less like he was looking for another place to work and more like he was looking for a place to belong. Certainly, his career was storied, but he was for once in a place filled to the brim with men like him. They all had a certain look, a look he found in abundance in a crowd of men ahead of him, circled around some building whose signs he could not make out.

The man was a visionary in the field of weapons design, and had shown him a number of proposed firearms he intended to continue development upon.\n\nHe, and WerBell besides, had been most interested in a number of compact, extremely high rate-of-fire submachine guns, almost small enough to be considered, at least ostensibly, as a pistol. The military and clandestine potential of such a weapon was obvious, and WerBell had wholeheartedly agreed to facilitate the concern's administrative needs as much as possible.\n\nWerBell had even proposed some ideas of his own, primarily concerning the potential of such weapons with suppressors of various sizes, which Ingram himself had found quite interesting. They were both sure there would be many more weapon designs to come, which could be leveraged not only for profit, but for the state's operations both domestically and abroad.\n\nYes, WerBell thought, it was yet another victory for capitalism in the Far East.

He was, naturally, careful to moderate his efforts to such a degree as to not cause trouble. Many of his former comrades had not been so fortunate, and he had, indeed, shot several of them to prove his loyalty to the new regime.\n\nHe wondered what Matkovsky would have thought of him working with WerBell so. The man had always been supremely practical, understanding the need for hard choices. The party split and retreat to Magadan had been proof enough of that. He pondered if Matkovsky would have understood his choices.\n\nPavlov quickly put the thought out of his mind. If there was one thing he had learned during his many years in the RFP, it was that one had to be very able and willing to change with the times. He had before, when Matkovsky had split from Rodzaevsky. And he was doing so once again. He did not know how long this new reality was to last, but as long as it did, he would ensure he was part of it. While also, of course, making sure he was ready should it fall.

A police car had parked across the street, and the man in the front seat was repeatedly glancing at his storefront in between snippets of conversation with his partner. Even as typewriters clacked and presses did their work behind him, he stood silent as he watched their every action. After what felt like ages, the cops finished their talking and filed out of their car. Dmitri's heart fell into his stomach as he watched them begin walking towards his door.\n\nThe bell jingled as the police officers entered the building. Dmitri put on a fake smile and turned to them, \"What seems to be the problem, officers?\"\n\n\"Did you publish this?\" Spoke the man in front, holding out a Newspaper with an all-too-familiar headline: Thousands of Troops Without Pension Due to Frighteningly Incompetent New Policy. But, what was more damning, was the line right above it: The Magadan Eye. Dmitri's newspaper.\n\n\"Yes, but-\"\n\n\"Shut it down, by order of President WerBell, Esq.\"\n\n\"But I-\"\n\n\"Do you want me to force you? Because that can be arranged.\"\n\nDmitri sighed, \"No...\"\n\n\"Good. You have 24 hours to close this whole operation, or me and my partner will make another visit.\"\n\nAs the officers left the building, Dmitri sighed and began walking into the back room where his staff worked, ready to deliver the bad news."

He'd been hiding for a while, he wasn't quite sure how long, after the Supreme Soviet fell to Magadan's dogs. He wasn't an idiot. He could see the writing on the wall - a Communist and an NKVD agent? There wasn't a chance he'd survive here. So, like, some manner of vermin, he had hid. For so long. That is, until he heard boots crunching snow outside of the cabin he had found refuge in.\n\nHow could they have found him? He thought to himself, hearing the steps come closer and closer to the cellar doors. There was definitely more than one person coming, he thought, he was sure of it. Before he knew it, the darkness of the basement was pierced by daylight as the doors were thrown open with a dull creak. Gurgen froze, shutting his eyes tight.\n\n\"Gurgen Aseryants?\" Spoke a voice from somewhere he could not see. Slowly he opened his eyes, pressing his numb hands into the ground to push himself into a sitting position. \"Uh... not quite sure you can hear me, but we have an offer for you.\"\n\nShivering, Gurgen replied, \"Who... who the hell is 'we'?\"\n\n\"United States of Siberia. We could use men of your particular... peacekeeping, talents.\"\n\nStill cold, Gurgen raised an eyebrow at the name, but ultimately opted to disregard it's absurdity. Better than freezing to death in a dusty basement, \"...Very well. Why me?\"\n\n\"We've recruited a number of ex-NKVD agents, we could use one more. Besides, your friend here with me, Genrikh Lyushkov, gave you a stellar recommendation.\"\n\nGurgen sat up, grinning at the name of his old comrade.

He'd seen worse wounds from his days with Matkovsky's blackshirts, but it still hurt like hell. Glancing up, he saw a man, what looked to be an officer of some sort, approaching his cell. Yuri staggered to his feet, expecting to be called to attention only for the man to approach the next cell over.\n\nA hushed conversation proceeded between the stranger and Yuri's neighbor, before the jingling of keys could be heard, followed by the metallic whine of a cell door grinding open. \"Good to be back!\" Exclaimed a voice which was becoming louder as its origin exited his cell. The uniformed officer led Yuri's prison mate into view as he finally approached his cell - none other than Georgy Shekherev, leader of the Amur Blackshirts. Yuri certainly held mixed feelings toward the revelation; Amur had been his sworn enemy for the longest time, but they both shared a prison under WerBell's republic.\n\n\"Prisoner Yuri Vitvitsky,\" said the officer, as if reading from a script, \"The United States of Siberia has an offer to extend to you.\"\n\nYuri raised an eyebrow, \"And just what is that offer?\"\n\n\"A full pardon for you and several other blackshirts, in exchange for your service to the States as a peacekeeper.\"\n\n\"Christ, anything that'll get me out of this cell is fine by me.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the Officer, plucking another key from the chain on his belt and pressing it into the lock on his cell door, sliding it open with the same distinctive grind. At last, Yuri left his tiny little cell behind."

 westalaska.23.desc: "WerBell found himself pensive, a light up Cuban cigar in his mouth to give him some \"inspiration\" so to speak. The mercenary turned warlord had been pondering on the state of his little eastern Siberian domain, which turned out to be - quite frankly - a shit show to run. Political instability had been a staple of the region for a little over a decade now, governments ranging from Communist dictatorships to more esoteric ones like Men's religious mandate, and of course one shouldn't forget of Matkdovsky's travesty of a \"republic\" distorting what little idea the natives had of the concept of democracy.\n\nHow could such an unruly region be governed by its people or by anyone for that matter? Mitchel had no idea. Institutions such as the ones found in the United States of America couldn't be implemented over here, or at least, not in the same format or in the current situation that Western Alaska found itself in. As he puffed out a cloud of smoke, the middle-aged man grimaced as a thought crossed his mind: his dream of a federal government couldn't be conciliated with the reality of the situation he found himself in. Though he abhorred the idea, ruling by decrees would be the solution he'd have to settle for - for now - in order to bring much needed stability.\n\nYet as he started to warm up to his decision, WerBell feared that this show of despotic rule would set a precedent for the rise of a would-be dictator successor in the long run."

Now all that remained was a shell with a basement, one that worked perfectly for him and his friends.\n\nWhen Andrei entered, Katya smiled at his arrival. \"I was afraid you were going to pussy out,\" she said, then slapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"And what, miss your great company?\" Andrei replied, which got a round of laughs. \"Okay, enough bullshitting around. Let's talk business.\" For the rest of the night, Andrei spoke with the others about the needs of the people. Some of them were just upset about the mercenaries getting to do whatever they wanted. Others wanted to implement some of the reforms from the old Union. But it was nothing radical. It could turn into that easily, but the small group of free thinkers was dedicated to nonviolence for the moment. Not out of an ideological underpinning, but because they believed it would lead to their destruction.\n\nWhich is why Katya had to keep showing up at these meetings. Back at her home, she spoke on the radio to her handler. \"No, it's a lot of hot air right now, but that Andrei is a smart one. He might do something either brilliant or stupid, either way it could do damage. I'll keep here for another month or so.\" With that finished she doused her cigarette, put away the radio and went to bed."

Now the skin on his palm, not protected, was red, blotchy and swollen, not to mention throbbing with pain. Staggering back away from the furnace and nearly tripping over the man behind him, he caught the eye of one of the supervisors that had been assigned to the mill days ago. Wincing through the pain, he watched the supervisor approach him and roughly address him.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing?\"\n\n\"Sir, I-\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear it.

They were, in fact, in view from her window where she had been watching the sun slowly make its way beneath the skyline, bathing the streets in ochre that was slowly fading to purple and would transition from there to midnight blue. A black car followed by a motorcade of military trucks rolled through the streets, pulling up right beside the Administrative Offices.\n\nIntrigued, Lada leaned further out her window, gripping the sill and trying to discern who was climbing out of the car. Noone she knew, that's for certain, nor anyone who had ever been seen on a ballot or appointed by the Soviet. No, it was some variety of high ranking military man. She never could get down the specifics of uniforms in the newly forged USS, but the man certainly had the entourage to prove his rank.\n\nShe watched the little ant sized man enter the building along with a few soldiers. After a few minutes, more figures exited the building. Only it wasn't the soldiers, it was the administrative staff of the building. Lada stared at the window with deep concern as most of Yakutsk's government was ordered out of the building, presumably to be replaced by the man in the fancy cap and whatever staff he chose to keep. Worriedly, she stepped away from the window and went to go turn on one of her lamps, the night being quite dark by now.

When he had decided to sign up for the army, he'd assumed the line would be much shorter, but he'd arrived to a staggeringly long queue that he was now near the end of. Really, he had no idea who in their right mind would choose to sign up for this paradox of an army, but here he was standing in line. He had no other options, anyway.\n\nHis father had been getting sicker and sicker and his worthless factory job wouldn't cover the medical bills. Ever since the old man had come back from the war in the west, he'd been getting sicker by the year. Andrei had no idea what had happened; maybe it was the bullet in his thigh, maybe it was the months spent in the mud, but he hadn't been able to pay a doctor to treat him much less diagnose him. He'd been just about ready to call it quits when he heard about the new recruitment program; not only were they promising him rights for when his service concluded, but they extended to his family as well.\n\nSo he told his old boss at the munitions factory to shove it and came here, to stand in line and check a clock every five minutes. Finally, he was stirred from his thoughts by the man in front of him leaving the line. He was at the desk now, where a broad shouldered, man in uniform sat.\n\n\"Good morning, friend. I trust you are here to join up?\" He said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Andrei, resisting the urge to sardonically ask him why else he would be there.\n\n\"Just sign here.\" He nodded, sliding a paper in front of the soon-to-be recruit.\n\nAndrei stared down at the blank space waiting for his signature. \"It'll all be worth it...\" He muttered, before signing away his rights in hopes of more in the future."

 westalaska.29.desc: "Back in the west, impossibly far from Magadan, lay the historic city settled by Peter the Great. The subject of WerBell's interest however was in the landmark created by his niece, Anna. She created the Versailles of Russia, the Winter Palace. It had been the seat of Kerensky's government for a time, but its place in history was cemented by the Bolsheviks storming it in 1917. Not to mention the scarring memory of its destruction, filmed for all to see in the widely distributed films from the German invasion. That Goebbels sure did know how to film the obliteration of history...\n\nNevermind that, WerBell thought. The construction of his Presidential Palace, built as closely as possible to the Winter Palace which was once in St. Petersburg, was complete. It now lay in the Siberia, a proper land of ice and snow. The only fitting place for a Winter Palace, no?\n\nHe was celebrating the occasion with some French wine, brought all the way here from the Atlantic. Over a dozen bottles had been distributed to his men, who would partake in the celebration of the Palace's completion with him. In spirit, though. WerBell wanted to spend tonight by himself. He thought about his contender to the west, who could enjoy the full bounty of Bukharin's Siberian Plan. As he sipped from his glass and looked around, a smile creased his face. He had united a band of the lost and forsaken to his cause. He had made a new nation, not Russian, but one of his own design. He was the master of war and with his beloved soldiers, would march forward and crush whoever was in his path. Would Caesar hesitate, would Napoleon? Actually, to hell with those losers! They were conquerors. He was a builder. He was going to be a Washington. That is how history would remember him. He would accept no excuse to this."

Clearly, this gilded structure was where the old Tsar once resided. Now, it was to become an empty husk stripped bare by WerBell's mercenaries.\n\nEvery step became more difficult than the last. Even with two men carrying the chest, the weight of the valuables within made transporting it a herculean affair. \"Come on, Kurt, put your back into it! I feel like I'm doing all the work here!\" Kurt's comrade, a large American man, choked out with a strained voice.\n\n\"I'm trying, it's just-\" Before Kurt could conjure up some kind of explanation for his lackluster performance, he felt the chest begin to wobble. Both men lost their balance, and an object slipped out onto the grand and a shattering could be heard.\n\n\"Fuck,\" The American grumbled under his breath, \"I hope the Captain didn't see that. What did we lose?\"\n\nKurt looked down to see a shattered picture frame, containing a seemingly recent photograph of an old Cossack sitting next to a balding man wearing the clothes of a royal.

Being a tramp freighter, they've made runs all over the world, but being based out of the West Coast means that most of those trips have been to much... sunnier places. Japan. Indonesia. Australia. Mexico. Hawaii. Never some absurd 'Republic of West Alaska', as the locals called it, in Frozen Hellhole, Russia. A few other captains he knew had also started making their first few runs up to Magadan since the Russians finally started to get off their asses and rebuild.\n\nThe San Diego native glanced over at a man approaching him, a Russian wrapped in far fewer layers than he. \"You're here dropping off the auto parts, yes?\" Began the man, in heavily accented English.\n\n\"Yes, yes. You're the buyer, then?\" Inquired Frank.\n\n\"Oh, no. I just came out to watch. There's been a, uh, big buzz around town with all the American businesses moving here. This is a Ford shipment, yes?\"\n\n\"Mhm. Never expected to make a shipment out here, much less autoparts. Figured if I was ever gonna make a delivery to Russia it'd be after an arms company decides to start contracting us. They mostly make liners do this shit.\" Frank said, shortly before muttering something along the lines of \"This is one weird country.\"\n\nApparently, the Russian had heard the slight and glanced over at Frank.

The scruffy mercenaries that patrolled the streets were even from his own country! Though they swore allegiance to a new United States.\n\nIt didn't matter. Johnny had the chance here to expand his business like never before. When your business is trees, you're limited by the amount. Not to mention reforesting after you're done so the trees are there for you next time. Unlike back home, Johnny didn't have to worry about environmental protections, oversight, or much of anything in the way of Big Government keeping the Little Guy like him down. Well, little being figurative he still inherited this business from his pappy and his before him. But he was a worker!

His company had endless growth and already investors back home were raking over the cash to help feed his enterprise. Even more would be lining up to invest after the first year, and the next, and the one after that. Each year ramping up production. And Johnny knew he wasn't the only company coming in.

And now he was paying for it.\n\nAt first he figured he could hire American workers, but his contract stated he needed to use local labor. Next he wanted to set up several camps at once, but the infrastructure wasn't there for it. Hell, it was hard enough getting gas for all the trucks he needed. Production was almost ten times slower here than it was back home. The investors had stopped being interested at all. There was only one recourse for Johnny, to bail out. That was the only way he would be able to save his company without it falling apart. Except...\n\nHe didn't read the fine print. He was bound to provide a certain amount of jobs and give a certain amount of revenue, in taxes, to the United States of Siberia. Not to mention a certain amount of lumber, to help with the rebuilding of so many homes destroyed in the unification of the east. That would be done with Walton lumber.\n\nIt wasn't simply Johnny either. All of the American companies that had come here were trapped for at least a decade, if not more. It had been so simple. The government here knew American companies would be too eager to expand, too happy to jump the gun.

The glowing neon sign that read 'Coca-Cola' in American letters. He was certain the Cyrillic sign would come up any day now. It's what it promised. American imports had flooded Magadan, giving it life. New jobs were popping up everywhere. To match demand, he had been promoted at the docks and now directed an entire team of dockworkers to handle the cargo. That had been money in his pocket and food on his table aplenty.

It now serves to enrich not only those who control it and those who do business in it, but even those ordinary people who live in and around it.

Overall commercial participation, both domestic and foreign, continued to increase.\n\nAnd as he well knew, it was all thanks to his government, and his policies. How could it not be? The communists, fascists, and fundamentalists that had once contended dominance over the Russian Far East had utterly failed to leverage the near-limitless resources of the land. But he had not.\n\nHe had brought good old-fashioned American ingenuity and entrepreneurship to this once darkened land. He had brought the light of progress. And now one of Russia's poorest regions was soon to become its richest.\n\nYes, he thought, the Far East was back in the game.

Stomping out his cigarette, Mason turned to see a rather irritated-looking WerBell exiting the passenger seat of the jeep. \"YOU! You've got a lot of explaining to do, buddy!\"\n\nMason took a glance around the lot of the docks. If anyone was around, they likely would've heard WerBell's outburst. \"Hey, keep it down, Mitch!\" He uttered in a sort of half-shout, half-whisper.\n\nWerBell did not get any more calm as he approached. \"I just got off the phone with my foreign minister. You know what he told me? The US refuses to recognize us as a legitimate state! What's the fucking deal?! I thought we had something going here!\"\n\nThe agent sighed. \"Look, our deal here was always of a more... clandestine nature. Official recognition was never guaranteed, but either way our partnership does not change. My colleagues are still willing to work with you no matter what the State Department says in public.\"\n\nThe mercenary grinded his teeth in frustration.

She shivered in her fur coat, a gift from a friend - or is it a former friend? - and her breaths came in gusts of white and gray, as trembling fingers plucked the cigarette from its place.\n\nThe pavement clicked beside her, and she reflexively reached for her holster. Nothing was there, much less a gun. Old habits die hard. She eased up, taking in the full figure of her friend - or is it former friend? He reeked of whisky, although he tried his best to mask the odor beneath a layer of perfume. Strange. She did not recall him doing anything of the sort, not least to someone he disagreed with.

Seated at his desk, armed guards at his side, Hemming struggled to follow the thread of the conversation. In their provincial Russian, the peasants jabbered and pointed fingers at one another in an accusatory fashion.\n\n\"Okay,\" said Hemming in his elementary Russian, \"Oleg, you say that Petr stole your pig?\" Oleg nodded, dark eyebrows bouncing as he scowled at Petr. \"And Petr, you deny this?\" Petr also nodded, glaring at his accuser. \"And I understand that there's no witnesses or receipt of sale of said pig?\"\n\nOleg scowled, \"I don't need a receipt, the thief took my pig right from my pen!\"\n\n\"Liar!\" shouted Petr, who was held back by one of the guards as he rounded on Oleg.\n\n\"Jesus,\" said Hemming, \"everyone calm down!

The Agency, and by extension the United States, could not be publicly seen to be supporting a warlord strongman with no legitimacy whatsoever.

But they were very much not competent at just about everything else. That would change. The men, experts of warzones the world over, would train these scum into a more effective force.\n\nThey would smile and patiently instruct them, and participate in operations as embedded advisors and field observers.

Central Siberia was finally in his hands, the misfits, fanatics, and goons of the region now six feet under, goddamn, today was a good day to be Mitchell WerBell III.\n\nThe lights of Chita twinkled below him from his balcony atop the former Tsar's palace, just as the bright Siberian stars shone above him. WerBell was always surprised at how bright the stars could be on the frontier.\n\nHe chuckled to himself at that. The frontier this certainly was, and WerBell was a trailblazing cowboy with American guns and toys, ready to make his mark on this savage land. Yes, that's what he would call it, his frontier, his United States of Siberia.\n\nHe could hardly believe the circumstances that had brought him to this place. The call from Vonsiatsky, the coup, the subsequent wars. Everything could have turned on a dime and sunk WerBell like a stone, but Lady Luck had been in his corner the whole time.\n\nThe Wizard of Whispering Death let out a cloud of smoke against the night sky, savoring in his victory and in the tobacco haze, could taste future victories to come."

Soldiers from Tomsk, anarchists, Siloviks, Rurik loyalists, mutineers, and Red Army vestiges made up their force. They numbered, at most two hundred at the start, but skirmishes with the mercenaries had dwindled their numbers further, and now there perhaps forty of them left. They hugged the treeline, these last warriors of Central Siberia, watching the truck convoy of the so-called United States of Siberia roll through the woods. They were outnumbered by the mercenaries, but a quick strike might earn them much-needed supplies and another day of resistance.\n\nLudmilla, a Silovik, peered through the sights of her rifle, waiting for Vasily's signal. Petr, an anarchist, raised his RPG. Finally, Vasily waved his hand forwards. Ludmilla's rifle cracked, Petr's RPG roared, and a dozen other small-arms weapons discharged on the convoy. A rocket slammed into the side of a truck, the explosion flipping it on its side in a fiery conflagration. A bullet ate brain meat and the driver of the lead truck fell dead, the vehicle careening into a tree. All was chaos and death as mercenaries shouted and sighted targets, partisans rushing down to grab what equipment they could.\n\nVasily scampered over a dead mercenary, rushing to the back of one of the downed trucks. He tore open the tarp, and gave a quiet cheer as he saw the medical crates his movement so desperately needed. He gave a start, whirling as he felt a harsh thump in his ribs. Had someone struck him? Vasily turned, wondering why his vision was swimming. A black man in sunglasses with one of the fancy American rifles fired again, his second shot taking Vasily out at the knees. As his vision faded, Vasily watched as his companions fell, their final raid all for nothing."

That included the big fish for her new agency. When she left the capitol she was an agent with a handler. Now she was a Director for the Department Domestic Conspiracies in the Strategic Service Unit. It felt good, it felt... official. In the van with her was a new recruit on his first mission. Next to him was a CIA instructor, who pretended to not be CIA but a normal American mercenary. In the building across the street was a meeting of students being radicalized by a firebrand. In the building next to them... twenty or so agents ready to strike at a moment's notice. Katya knew better than to trust him.\n\n\"Have they said anything important?\" Katya asked the recruit. The young man shook his head. Katya let out a sigh. \"Seems this isn't working,\" Katya said, then she waited and added, \"Alright. We're going in.\"\n\nMr. CIA let out a gasp, then said in his clipped Russian, \"You can't be doing that. Evidence!\" Katya turned to him with a grin, cocking back her M1911. \"Our States aren't your States, cowboy.\" The recruit racked back a German surplus rifle and the three of them bursted inside of the meeting. It was a congregation of some youth agitators who wanted a return to socialism. A picture of Sablin hung at the corner which made Katya almost gag. Couldn't these types find someone else to idolize? At least Lenin had a nice beard. Her intuition to march in was correct. The leader was hoarding stolen guns from the army surplus. It was a win then, to stop this idiot before he got them all these kids killed.\n\n\"What are you going to do with them?\" Mr. CIA asked once the last were put up. \"The leader?\" Katya replied, \"Ten years for the theft probably. The others we can shame and threaten, split them up. Maybe bug their landlines at home to see if they try anything after.\" With that, Katya walked off towards her favorite bar.

This man would be his protector for the rest of time. Anatoly had held a significant post in Novosibirsk and unlike everyone of a similar rank, was willing to work with the madman from Magadan. Not that it had made him any friends. Already every single colleague had greeted the Provisional Governor of the State of Novosibirsk with death threats. Pinned to his door with a knife, of course. Just to drive that little detail home. Anatoly looked for solace among the many mercenaries flowing into his city but found only the Congolese a decent drinking companion. Largely because he didn't speak. The others were loud, largely foreign mob that had no respect for anything besides their own pockets!\n\nIt wasn't like his work was particularly important either. He signed off on orders to repair railway lines, rebuild factories, and repurpose old military surplus to be used by the...Oh it was such a ridiculous fucking name! The United States of Siberia?

Ivan had been dragged here about an hour ago, for what he thought was an interrogation. That was the only logical reason why they hadn't killed killed him for being a Novosibirsk general. He had never expected what it would turn into - a job interview.\n\n\"Victory at the battle of Kemerovo. Victorious partisan campaign in northern Tomsk. Embittered last stand in the ruins of Altay. A million more victories and bitter, but hard fought, defeats. Quite a track record you have, really. Your boys put a great few of our boys in the dirt,\" continued the Minister.\n\n\"And? It was my job,\" replied Ivan, surprised at the rather biting addition to the list.\n\n\"Mr. Tarasov, you're mistaking a compliment for an accusation. What I'm saying, is we could use men like you leading our armies. They are efficient and skilled, as you have seen, but unruly. A strong hand at the lead.\"\n\n\"I see. Is that why I'm not dead yet?\"\n\n\"Now you're getting the gist, Tarasov. So, what will it be?

His grin was plastered from ear to ear on his face. It was a rictus grin, not a friendly one. The Captain's teeth were grinding together, a vein on his forehead bulged. When the Captain's hand drifted towards his pistol, the mouthy executive shut up.\n\n\"What we have here, is a failure of communication. You've been well compensated for your investments, but we have no more need of any of you. Your citizenship has been revoked, your worker visas have been rescinded, you are all leaving right away. And don't think the companies staying will fall on their swords to help you, because they won't. We need them. We don't need you. Bye bye.\" The Captain gestured for the group to get a move on.

After fighting with and against so many different militaries in so many different conflicts, WerBell was something of an expert at identifying the combat effectiveness of any unit rather quickly. He tallied the mistakes in his head and measured them against his expectations before turning to the general at his right.\n\n\"You know what, they're not half-bad!\"\n\nThe general was visibly relieved. \"Not for lack of trying, Mitch.

WerBell found the transition between approving a poster on his desk and seeing it plastered everywhere a little strange, but such was life. God, how far had they come? He'd gone from a mercenary working for a fascist to the President of half the former Soviet Union. No matter what happened now, he'd made his mark.\n\nYet that wasn't enough. If he just wanted to be remembered, he'd have gone out in an amphetamine rush in some battlefield long ago. He was after something more: guns, booze, and glory! Oh, how the old days called back to him sometimes... but no, not that either. WerBell was invested in Russia now. If he wanted to leave, he could have left with a fortune by '64. He sat at this desk every day because he believed in this project, however insane it is.\n\nWerBell glanced over at the maps on his desk, looking over the lines and arrows that made up his plan to invade West Russia - nothing like the arrows on the poster. In the early days, the army was little more than professional bandits. They invaded what they could to take what they needed to live. Now they were thriving, and Russia was too! Magadan's port was more crowded every day, maritime shipping breathing life into Siberia's economy. Russians lived with a measure of prosperity they hadn't seen since '45, and they knew it. WerBell felt proud of himself. He was cultivating something beautiful in this accursed land, something Russia had only seen briefly in its entire history: Democracy.\n\nRussia would come to enjoy the same freedoms Americans have had since 1776, and its people would love liberty just like God-fearing Americans did back home. Let the hordes to the west assemble on the border, WerBell thought. He had fate on his side, and the most badass army the world had ever seen at his back."

Mr. Nakamura was the representative for the few hundred individuals who identified as Ainu in the state Lev represented. Nakamura shook his head, going into the same speech given a hundred times. Under the Tsar, under the Japanese, and under the Communists each and every time the Ainu were persecuted. Already many had been executed in the forced conversion strategies of their oppressors. And now they were denied a state of their own?\n\nLev sympathized with them. He truly did. He had fought alongside two Ainu mercenaries during the early days of WerBell's grand scheme. Good, fierce men from a hardy culture. Now as a Senator, it was his duty to help them. Unfortunately, there simply wasn't enough Ainu living to justify the creation of their own state.\n\n\"Mr. Nakamura, that wasn't the only reason I called you here. You see... Having spoken to the President himself I am confident we can secure for you and your people a privileged minority status. Many other Siberian ethnicities are receiving the same. It helps that for such a small population, the Ainu have contributed quite a few capable soldiers. You understand that soldiers hold quite a powerful sway in our nation, yes?\"\n\nLev left the meeting feeling happy, knowing that dozens of conversations were happening as the new states were put into effect. He wasn't sure where this experiment of a country might end up. He wasn't certain of the foreign influence either, for that matter. What he was certain of that he was going to set a precedent, here, in the poorest state of this new federal union. There was hope on the horizon for Lev, who started out only as a mercenary from Manchuria. Before the old man left his office, he turned and said to Lev,"

The sounds of celebration almost drowned out his thoughts, but WerBell was determined to take a second to think about what got him here before drowning in alcohol and women.\n\nThey did it. They actually fucking did it. All of free Russia now laid beneath the eagle's wing, the light of American-style democracy banishing the darkness of the anarchy. Since the declaration of unification, foreign investments increased tenfold. Any corporation worth a damn in the free world has opened its first establishments on Russian soil, bringing half the planets' products to a people who have never even seen a modern radio. The demand for foreign goods was never satiated, and back home business was booming.\n\nSpeaking of business, the United States of Russia was now firmly established as the preeminent exporter of mercenaries worldwide, changing the tide of many a civil war in the name of gold and glory. Those who called it the Mercenary State usually do so as an insult, an attempt to question the legitimacy of the USR's rule, but WerBell accepted that name with pride. Never had a nation like his existed, and never will one again.\n\nOf course, some weren't happy with the result. Fuck 'em. There never was a mercenary who cared about the complaints of liberal pussies back home, and WerBell was no exception. Domestically, however, there were a number of Russians protesting his rule, something he did take more seriously. WerBell wasn't too worried about it, though. He could only imagine the culture shock they were experiencing; in only ten years Russians had gone from taking pot shots at each other with Mosin-Nagants to driving American cars and enjoying American freedom. They'd get used to it, he knew. He'd make Texans of them yet.\n\nAs his train of thought concluded, something caught his eye. Two somethings, to be exact, and some of the biggest ones he'd ever seen. WerBell still didn't speak much Russian, but a wink was worth a thousand words. As she approached him with an experienced stride, the old mercenary indulged in one final thought:"

We've never had a favourable amount of soldiers, or guns, or hell even popular support, and now half of this beautiful wasteland is under our banner. Do ya get what I'm saying?\"\n\nThe aide spoke up, \"I believe I-\"\n\n\"Rhetorical question, god dammit,\" WerBell chuckled for a moment before continuing. \"Our army has served and currently serves in more conflicts around the world than any superpower. From here in Siberia to Africa and the Middle East, our men fight, bleed, and die. Other nations might have more industry, better designs, and limitless conscripts, but we have the experience, the discipline, and a history of using both to send superior forces running with their tails between their legs. The Siberian Army is the best fighting force this side of Moskowien, and it'll be the best in the goddamn world before I'm through!\"\n\nThe old mercenary took a breath after his miniature speech, refocusing on the man in front of him as he steadied himself.\n\n\"Now, what else does the army need?\"\n\nThe aide opened his mouth for a second, but then closed it, staring at his President wide-eyed like a deer struck dumb in the headlights of a car.

Men and women on their way to factories and shops, parents and children hurried about to grocers to fill their pantries, and some simply sat on benches and observed the passing of the day. A smile broke out on his face when he saw a young soldier guide a scared child back to her parents.\n\nEvery once in a while a former sailor of the Pacific Fleet would approach him and they would talk of life since the dark days in Kamchatka. The younger would boast of pregnant wives and new children and the elders of grandchildren and the relatively easy lives they live now. The Admiral always took time to speak with these men, to hear their problems and their triumphs. When his men needed help, he would do his best to give it and when all they needed was an ear to listen he was all too happy to do so.\n\nIvan eventually found his usual haunt. A small bench under the shade of a great old pine tree facing out into the waters of the Pacific. As he sat, he thought back to the old days. The days after the end of the Great Patriotic War, as the Pacific Fleet slowly but surely came together in Petropavlovsk. He remembered the hard times when the fleet, once the pride of the Union in the East, were forced to prey on shipping lanes in order to survive.\n\nHe thought back to the Divine Mandate's fall to the Fascists of the National Republic, the very same republic he now lived in. It was a strange time for the fleet, as the fascists were soon ousted from within by the current President. Now, as he gazed out at the waters of the Pacific he could not help but think how lucky they had been. Disaster had been averted when Petlin and his supporters ousted the Vozhd and restored the rights of the people. It was strange to think of the origins of this state, but he would say that it was a worthy one. A state he had come to truly feel at home in."

Thanks to luck, skill, and an abundance of American aid, the United States of Russia is now one of the largest nations on the planet. To state that the world is shocked would be an understatement. Analysts are still struggling to figure out how his government hasn't already collapsed from the sheer ridiculousness of its existence, all while the man himself sits upon a veritable mountain of money, laughing all the way.\n\nSomeone like WerBell, though, never truly rests. Constantly jumping between managing internal affairs, foreign connections, and personal matters, the mercenary is clearly not content with merely unifying Russia. His commitment to the army without borders is unwavering, but so is his support for bringing American-style democracy to Russia. It remains to be seen how these contradictions will be addressed, but some are beginning to hope WerBell, for all his flaws, might actually bring something good to the exhausted Russian people.\n\nDecried as an American asset by many, WerBell finds himself with both Japan and Germany wary of - if not outright hostile to - his regime. Though he certainly loves his home country, WerBell is not nearly as leashed as some fear or would like him to be. He is a man with an army and a vision, and the world awaits his next move with bated breath."

 MAG_Vladimir_Kibardin_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government\nCorporatism§!------------\n§LSecretary of the RFP centered in Magadan, Vladimir Vladimirovich Kibardin has been a loyal follower of the Vozhd since the beginning. From exile in Harbin, the crossing of the Amur River, then solitude in the Port of Magadan, Kibardin has stayed by Matkovsky's side through every trial and tribulation Russia and the communists had to offer. However, if Matkovsky is the pragmatist of the RFP, Kibardin would be the dogmatist, his struggles only furthering his devotion to the ideology of fascism. To Kibardin, orthodox fascism is the only hope for Russia; meaning no evolution or devolution in the case of Rodzaevsky could change that.\n\nHowever, Kibardin's worship of orthodox principles could mean he is more loyal to the ideology of fascism than the Vozhd himself. One day, Kibardin might have to choose: His Vozhd, or his ideology?§!"
 MAG_Nikolay_Petlin_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nPaternalism§!------------\n§LNikolay Nikolayevich Petlin was born a Harbin native and has been a prominent member of the RFP for decades. Joining Matkovsky's wing after the split of the RFP, Petlin has found himself with a growing disillusionment with fascism, first with Rodzaevsky, and now in Magadan. Every day Petlin leaves his office, he sees his fellow Russians living in fear of the whims of the government and the one tyrant who has total control of their lives. Fascism isn't working, any form of it, and Petlin was only beginning to see the entire truth of the matter.\n\nHowever, with his job as the Chief Foreign Diplomat for the party, Petlin believes he has discovered a new path for Russia, the American path. For the most part up until now, contact with America has been sparse. However, Petlin plans to change that, and maybe one day the American model could come to Russia, reforming the fascist state into something freer, something every Russian could live in without having to fear for their lives or the lives of their families. Petlin's past sins continue to gnaw at him every night, and if making Russia into a better place is the only way for redemption, then he would have to try.§!"

That job has been given to one Igor Konstantinovich Kovalchuk-Koval, a more minor diplomat up until now. Having been in the shadow of his predecessor for quite some time, Kovalchuk-Koval is ready to show his face to the world, that face depending on how Matkovsky wants him to appear, anyway.\n\nKnowing his position, Kovalchuk-Koval is much more willing to toe the line than Petlin, not like that is a problem for him. Still, diplomats from across the world will find a stark change in the Far East's diplomatic stance, the Americans especially. It is Kovalchuk-Koval's job to make sure the weapon shipments continue to arrive, and the Vozhd is watching his chief diplomat much closer this time.

 MAG_WA_journalist.1.desc: "Patrick Sullivan had, in his time at the Washington Post, been given many strange assignments. This one, however, he found to be strangest of all. His editor had just placed the file in front of him, and he could barely believe what he was reading. \"Bob, you're a funny guy, I gotta tell you,\" he chuckled. \"But you really didn't have to go to all this effort for a practical joke.\"\n\n\"This isn't a prank, Pat,\" his editor replied. \"Everything in that file seems to be at least half-true.\"\n\nPatrick looked it over again. \"What, you're telling me that some American mercenary went over to Russia and...took over from a gang of Russian fascists? Bob, that's crazy. It sounds like something out of an adventure novel. A bad one.\"\n\nBob shrugged. \"Maybe, maybe not. But there's been interest in it from some of the other papers, and we need to jump on this while we still got the chance. We managed to get you a way to Magadan, you're leaving first thing next week.\"\n\nPatrick stammered, \"Uh, Bob, this sounds -I mean, c'mon Bob, you know Mary's expecting, I can't go on a long assignment like this.\"\n\n\"Look, Patrick, it won't be that hard. You can head back whenever you want. You're one of the only Russian speakers here, we need you on this. OK? We'll make sure Mary is fine until you come back.\" Patrick thought it over, then nodded. Bob was right, he was one of the few people who could probably do journalism in Russia. And yeah, he could end this whenever he wanted."
 MAG_WA_journalist.1.a: "\"Guess I'll see you later, Bob.\""
 MAG_WA_journalist.2.t: "Welcome to Russia"
 MAG_WA_journalist.2.desc: "He'd heard stories from refugees and diplomats of postwar Russia; a land of bandits and starving peasants, where a warlord's army was lucky to be using equipment that would have been very familiar to Bukharin's Red Army. What he saw was not that. Men patrolled the streets with modern American, Japanese, even German equipment, with crisp uniforms and decent discipline. The people were still poor as shit, but the sight of so many who enjoyed so much foreign wealth, even if they were relatively few, made Magadan an anomaly.\n\nPatrick Sullivan stepped off the dock and found himself face to face with a tall man in military fatigues, an M14 slung over his shoulder. \"I am looking for lodgings,\" Patrick asked the man in halting Russian; he knew he should have refreshed his skills since college.\n\n\"I'm an American, dipshit,\" the soldier replied in English. \"You're clearly not a Russian, but you're clearly not a merc either. So who are you?\" Pat scrambled to pull his press badge out of his coat, and presented it to the soldier, who snatched it from him and read it over. He laughed as he handed the badge back. \"So you're a journo? You're not the first to come here, but maybe you'll be the last to leave. Hey! Assholes!\" he shouted at a group of soldiers playing cards nearby. \"Come help the new reporter get his stuff to the hotel!\"\n\n\"Blow it out your ass, Jensen,\" one replied in a Scottish accent.\n\n\"I'll blow it out yours if you don't get over here right fucking now, MacKenzie.\" As the soldiers exasperatedly moved to help, he slapped Patrick's back. \"Yeah, if you stick around long enough, you'll get your fucking story\""

 MAG_WA_journalist.3.desc: "\"So we know how you came here, and we know how you took over from Matkovsky. But what I'm interested in is why are you here?\"\n\nWerBell glanced at Sullivan with a smirk. \"I already told you why I'm here; there was a job, and I got stiffed. Had to take something as compensation, and the country suited me just fine.\"\n\n\"You could have taken anything else and gone home, though,\" Sullivan countered. He was slightly worried about the glares WerBell's bodyguards were giving him, though WerBell himself seemed to be amused by Sullivan's questioning, even as he took aim at the next target on the range with his vintage Garand. After firing off a few shots, he turned back to Sullivan. \"Did you serve in the war?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I was in Burma a while, and spent a lot of the war in Australia, in case Japan invaded.\"\n\n\"So you know how to use this,\" WerBell remarked, extending him the Garand. Sullivan paused, then decided it was better to humor the mercenary. He took the rifle, and caught the clip tossed at him by one of the bodyguards. Loading the rifle, he took aim.\n\nEight shots later, he heard the sweet, familiar ping as the clip ejected. WerBell handed him the spotter scope, which Sullivan glanced through. He'd gotten five shots in the 9 ring, two in the 10, and one in the X. Twenty years on, and he was still decent at this.\n\n\"Nice shooting. That feel good?\" WerBell asked.\n\n\"Yeah. Yeah, it did,\" Sullivan replied, chuckling. \"It felt great!\"\n\n\"That's why we're here,\" WerBell said. \"All of us, to some degree, are here because we feel just the way you do. And honestly? Considering you feel like that...\""
 MAG_WA_journalist.3.a: "\"...I'm willing to bet that you're going to stay too.\""
 MAG_WA_journalist.4.t: "Adrenaline"
 MAG_WA_journalist.4.desc: "The first concern Patrick Sullivan had was that his pen had run out of ink as he was writing down his notes to be sent back to the Post. The second was the thump of mortar fire that jostled the entire post, quickly followed by his third; the \"Hura!\" of the Red Army soldiers charging his position. All around him, the mercenaries grabbed their rifles and manned their machine guns, discipline breaking down under the surprise and ferocity of the Red attack. He saw in the corner of his eye a section of trench get overrun, and three Red soldiers rushed to the emplacement where he and one other mercenary remained. Panic overtook him, and he grabbed for the first thing that he could use to defend himself; a hatchet.\n\nThe first soldier entered the emplacement. He seemed older than the others, but still inexperienced; he should have tossed a grenade first. He turned just in time to divert a fatal blow, but the hatchet was wedged firmly into his shoulder. He fell back onto the floor, screaming. The second hesitated for a fateful moment, then tried to shoot Sullivan, rather than use the bayonet. Sullivan grabbed the rifle just as it fired, keeping the shot away from him. He wrestled with the soldier for the Mosin, eventually forcing him against a wall. Pat immediately rammed the bayonet into his stomach.\n\nThe third, probably no older than 16, had been trying to avoid shooting his comrade, and now stood, mouth agape, as he watched his friend die. He began to raise his rifle when the last mercenary fired, scattering brain and bone everywhere.\n\nPatrick turned back to the first soldier, crying from the pain of the hatchet, as he saw a bloody man above him. His eyes widened. \"Nyet! Nyet -\" he pleaded, before Patrick drove the bayonet into his stomach. He squirmed, before rattling one last time. Patrick stood over the corpse, panting, feeling the adrenaline. He smiled involuntarily."

 MAG_WA_journalist.5.t: "Heaven's Ruins"
 MAG_WA_journalist.5.desc: "The \"bar\" was what used to be Omolon's church. The mercenaries collected the meager relics of the church for their own use and served imported liquor -or communion wine, in a pinch- to other mercs in the village. It was all indicative of the very... aggressive entrepreneurial spirit he had encountered under WerBell, and even Sullivan, trying to write his story, joined in with the raucous mercenaries. The article could wait, life was short and the alcohol plenty.\n\nThey drank, laughed, told stories, and repeated the cycle until the \"bar\" was closed and the group was in a circle, either passed-out or soon to be.\n\n\"How'd it feel?\" Elizabeth \"Liz\" Thompson, an Australian mercenary, asked him.\n\n\"It felt great, honestly,\" he slurred back. \"Like back in Burma. The... simplicity of it all. Knowing what to do in a situation, what the stakes are... there's nothing like that back in the States.\" He sighed, and took another swig of the whiskey. \"Honestly? Some days I dread going back. But I have to, at some point, and I want to eventually.\"\n\n\"I thought you said you could *hic* go back whenever you wanted,\" MacKenzie interrupted from a stupor.\n\n\"Well, yeah. And my wife is back there, and my daughter, and...\" he couldn't think of anything else after that. Was that what kept him tethered to home? Mary, and a daughter whose name he could scarcely remember? As he sat there, drunk, Liz falling asleep on his shoulder, he wasn't sure how to feel."
 MAG_WA_journalist.5.a: "He drank again to dispel the thought."
 MAG_WA_journalist.6.t: "Dear Mary"
 MAG_WA_journalist.6.desc: "\"Dear Mary...\" the first words of the letter hung there alone, as Sullivan sat trying to write something, anything, to his wife. He racked his brain for the words necessary to convey his emotions, a confusing mess in his mind.\n\nWhat was there to say? \"Dear Mary, I'm sorry I abandoned you?\" Was he sorry? When he was here, with WerBell's army, he felt the best he'd ever felt. He barely thought of his family back in America in the heat of the moment, and only slightly more when he was in Russia at all. \"Dear Mary, I'm sorry your husband is a lying, cheating piece of shit?\" He looked back at Liz, drinking in the bed, her nakedness covered only by the sheet. The two of them had been doing this for a while, and had celebrated the fall of Tomsk with an extended stay in one of the captured hotels. Liz was older than Mary by a full decade, closer to Patrick's age, and not as attractive conventionally, but she knew battle. When they were together, in the trenches or in bed, he felt a euphoria that Mary had never given him. Did he love his wife? He remembered he had, but did he still?\n\n\"You want some?\" Liz asked, offering him one of the special sugarcubes they'd brought to celebrate, temporarily interrupting his thoughts.\n\n\"Not yet, Liz,\" he replied, before getting back to the letter. \"Dear Mary... Dear Mary...\" What could he even say? What would ever make up for the fact he barely remembered his daughter's name -was it Sarah or Barbara? - and had never seen her grow up? What would ever make up for the fact that he had failed as a husband? He drank from the glass of water next to him. Nothing, he knew. He would never be forgiven. He couldn't.\n\nHe grunted, crumpling the letter up and throwing it aside. He'd figure it out later, when his head was clearer. He climbed back into bed with Liz. \"I'll take that acid now, please,\" he said smiling."

 MAG_WA_journalist.7.t: "Home"
 MAG_WA_journalist.7.desc: "\"Don't you give me that bullshit!\" Mary shouted through the call. \"Don't you fucking dare! How dare you come back with barely a word? How dare you try and insert yourself back in my life!\"\n\n\"Mary,\" Sullivan sighed as he leaned against the payphone wall. \"Mary, I'm back now. I'm sorry I wasn't -\"\n\n\"Sorry? Sorry?! You're sorry for what? Abandoning me? Abandoning Kaitlyn? She's almost ten, Patrick, and you've never even met her!\"\n\n\"So that's her name...\" he thought aloud, before realizing what he'd just said.\n\nA pause at the end of the line, then she laughed in disbelief. \"I'm getting a lawyer and taking her with me. Don't look for us. Fuck you, Patrick.\" Then the dial tone.\n\nPatrick felt anger rush up in him, and only barely stopped himself from smashing the receiver to bits. He stepped outside and sat at the bench, watching the passengers go back and forth at SFO. He'd been like them, once, ten years ago. A family man, working a regular job. He pitied them, and his past self. They'd never know the things he'd done, not as he had. Not even the Pulitzer committee had when they'd mailed him the award. He sighed. He hated it here. The calm, the placidity, the... everything. Ten years on, Russia was still Russia; a land of guns, sweat, and adrenaline. A land none of these people would know.\n\nBut he was home. Didn't he want to be home? No, he realized. Home was Liz and MacKenzie. Home was the trench and the armory, the whiskey and the acid. Home was danger and euphoria. Not here. All he'd had left was Mary and his daughter, and now they were gone. Without them, he felt nothing for the ground he stood on. It was time to go home.\n\nHe went to the desk and told the lady at the desk, \"I'd like the earliest ticket for Magadan.\""

Her father had investments and connections within the American railway, allowing Vonsiatsky to funnel funds to the party. Appeasing him would further the flow.\n\nAlternatively, we could look for other avenues of support outside of a single man. The monarchists of Chita have tried to appeal to emigre communities, a strategy that may prove fruitful.

The brutish nature of these groups dampened public support for the Fascist Party and must be contained. Still, Matkovsky sees the greater value that these groups provide to the Party and nation. They are an arm of the Party that can reach beyond the bureaucracy, granting control and authority over the affairs of the state and day-to-day life. Petlin says otherwise, but what does he know?

It is an old idea inspired by the Republicans that briefly held power in 1917 and the many other nations tarnished by the German Reich. An independent decision-making collective that is untainted by the finagling of ignorant politicians is certainly appealing.

This is not a small deficit, sir.\"\n\nMatkovsky dismissed the accountant soon after, sank into his chair, and began to think deeply about what could be done. He had begun this simple task without expectations - or so he thought, until the full picture became clearer, and he realized that the situation was even worse than he had expected.\n\nIt wasn't difficult to see where this was going, and a hypothetical quickly presented itself in his mind. The party becomes insolvent: others quickly notice, and leap at the chance to pick on a defenseless competitor. Perhaps it could happen in reverse. One competitor or another attacks, and the party is unable to muster up the resources necessary to survive. A singular conclusion thus arrived: continuing like this would mean driving the metaphorical car straight off a cliff.\n\nMatkovsky deemed this completely unacceptable, so there was much work to be done. He would have to use the next meeting with the War Council to snap the party of its complacency, and get things moving. The sooner that happened, the better.\n\nAs he lazily gazed out outside, he spotted a troop of soldiers marching in unison. He stepped closer to the window, peering carefully at them - yes, they wore those familiar gray papakhas. It reminded him of a memory, where decades ago men like them - good Siberian Riflemen - fought and died against the communists. A dream that they had ultimately failed to realize."

The rest of the War Council figured it was probably best not to disturb him before the meeting began, instead sitting in silence, watching and waiting for what they expected would be bad news.\n\nWhen the clock on the wall struck nine times, Matkovsky immediately began speaking, keen on not wasting any time. \"Thank you for gathering here on such short notice,\" he began. \" You may ask questions later. For now, while our ship is sinking, we need action, not words.\"\n\n\"Because the situation we find ourselves in is so dire, I will be blunt with you,\" Matkovsky continued. \"The Party is currently spending far more than it currently receives. If we do not change course immediately, we will soon face insolvency.\"\n\n\"That is the bad news,\" he said, and some of the generals let out their breaths, relaxing a little. Matkovsky wasn't keen on letting that relief linger. \"But if you think that you can just simply relax right now, then I can tell you that our party is already dead.\"\n\n\"Now, the good news is that this is possible to fix. Our plan will be this.\" The generals shifted uncomfortably in their seats, waiting. \"First, we must expand our industrial capacity. We must salvage and acquire it - by any means necessary. That alone will not be enough. As such, we will need to ask the Americans and leverage the diaspora for support.

The endless marching, the biting cold, serving in an army led by tyrants. As he imagined it, each second began to stretch out into a painful eternity. Before he went in he decided, as an indulgence, to recall some of the memories of the last few months. He picked up a lilac almost in full bloom: absentmindedly, he began slowly, carefully, removing the petals one by one.\n\nA petal for the memory of that great hunt in the tundra. The boys were all so proud that day: they'd managed to catch a deer. It seemed so trivial now. Another petal for the time they sat round the fire in winter together, laughing as only they could. He remembered distinctly the sharp sourness of the lingonberry jam. There wouldn't be much of that in the army.\n\nThree petals, now. One for his father: his captain, his rock. One for his mother, who tried to hide her tears as she let go of her son. And one more - the final one - for Natasha, the love of his life, his soulmate. He wondered whether he would see her again, and he wasn't optimistic about his chances.\n\nThe air was cold, biting. He couldn't stay outside for much longer.

As the man passed the truck, he crossed the path of the unit's officer.\n\nClad in a distinct officer's hat and trench coat, the man, Stanislav, watched the chaos in front of him with a pleased look on his face. His thoughts were interrupted by the presence of one of his soldiers. \"Stanislav, sir!\" The man said while saluting, \"We've tracked the residence's inhabitants down in the surrounding forest and disposed of them as you ordered.\"\n\nA satisfied expression appeared on the officer's face. With the Communist traitors disposed of, the last of his orders for this wretched stretch of the countryside were complete. Soon, he would be gone from here suffering in the cold. Stanislav patted the soldier's shoulder.\n\n\"Good,\" Stanislav replied to his subordinate. He cleared his throat before continuing. \"Alright men, dump whatever you have now in the back of the truck and get back here. We're heading back to Magadan!\" The men obeyed systematically, fearing what might befall them if they didn't listen. Without any fanfare, the rare visit to this pocket of the earth was left behind, forgotten in the mix of its predecessors."
 matkovsky.smuta.4.a: "Barely a trace remained."
 matkovsky.smuta.5.t: "Cycles"
 matkovsky.smuta.5.desc: "Tweet! The sound of a whistle echoed throughout the factory floor, signaling the end of a shift. Sluggishly, men dragged themselves off their workstations and out into the pitch of midnight. Anton Volkov was one of these men, leaving in a fashion identical to that of his colleagues. Like them, he stumbled his way down into the empty streets of Magadan. After some time, the scattered workers had formed themselves into a silent-weary mob.\n\nFatigued, the mass of people trekked their way back to their apartments. All the while, they were pelted with a drizzle of cold rain. Their sorry reflections looked back at them from the sheen on the streets, laying pity and disappointment on what their lives had become. Meanwhile, the wind whistled through the rooftops, creating a hypnotic drone that set the blob mindless in their routine return.\n\nThe expressionless husk of people was interrupted by the thrumming of a passing car, before providing a loud honk at the wretched workers on the street. As the rest continued, Anton was awakened from his routine. He suddenly gained an awareness of his situation. The routine of sleep, work, and home, day after day without any breaks had finally set in for the worker. For as grateful as he was for having a job that paid, the isolation that accompanied it was not worth the loss of humanity.\n\nAs the rest of the men continued, Anton's steps became smaller. Slowly, he fell behind the rest of the group until he was left behind on his own. In the isolation of his thoughts, he concluded that anything, even miserable as being alone in the rain, was at least some form of variety, and right now, variety was a scarce commodity."
 matkovsky.smuta.5.a: "It was only a temporary escape."
 matkovsky.smuta.6.t: "Outlines of the Future"
 matkovsky.smuta.6.desc: "\"I'm going to be straight with everyone here, our finances are in trouble, and something needs to be done. Now!\" Matkovsky slammed his fist into the table adding new tension to the room. That was how the most recent party meeting started, with his cabinet all seated around him in agreement.\n\nThe room remained alarmingly silent. Members remained in fear of a proper response lest they end up in a part of Siberia colder than the President's immediate reception. Unfortunately for one individual, their cough echoed through the stress of the situation. All eyes had turned on them in hopes of a response.\n\nNervously, they stuttered out an answer. \"Err, well um we could continue to ask the Americans for aid. Guns, trucks, vehicles, those kinds of things.\" He rushed out his next words. \"I know that sounds crazy! However, if we can squeeze out enough from them, then they surely wouldn't abandon their investment further down the line.\n\nThe answer caused a knee-jerk reaction by another member. \"Bah! Are you stupid? That's what got us here in the first place! We should look inward and take the spoils of the land. Looting and conscripting the resources of our enemies would keep us afloat. After all, they deserve it since they are traitors.\"\n\nMatkovsky nodded along at the debate, and upon seeing their leader's tolerance the party had broken into an argument, quickly forming sides between the two arguments. He thought both had some merit, but needed to consider it a little longer. However, the party did not need to know that. \"That's enough talk. I think I've come to a solution from this meeting. You are all dismissed.\" As they piled out, he was now left alone to mull over the hard decision."
 matkovsky.smuta.6.a: "So long as an appearance was kept."
 matkovsky.smuta.7.t: "Losses and Gains"
 matkovsky.smuta.7.desc: "\"And here Mr. President, you can see the trajectory of our finances have stabilized, a vast improvement from when we last met.\" The sound of moving papers filled the office. \"Simultaneously if you look at the pie chart here, our foreign aid situation has also improved.\"\n\nNodding slowly, a smile grew on the President's face. \"Very good.\" Flipping through the papers handed to him, he saw material needs for production met and his past worries washed away in the victory of his current success.\n\nHowever, what pleased him most was not the report, but its implications. With the finances of the party settled he as helmsman of the party would soon be able to reclaim the west. Not just Communists and Monarchists in the Far East, but past that.\n\nThoughts of marching with his army into Siberia and past the Urals filled his mind, along with the glories that accompanied it. Even the thought of someday pushing into Moscow and taking his country back filled his mind while he became leader of a newly unified Russia.\n\nThese thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a familiar voice. \"Excuse me, Mr. President, are you alright? You've been staring at the wall smiling for the last five minutes.\"\n\nHis face grew warm as blood flowed to his cheeks. \"Yes, thank you I'm fine. Everything is satisfactory, you are dismissed.\" Quickly, the accountant gathered up his papers and made for the door before he could leave though Matkovsky managed to give one final statement to the accountant.\n\n\"Oh and if you tell anyone of this, you can expect to be in my office again, for different reasons.\" Hearing the instructions, he quickly nodded and shut the door, leaving the President alone in his office back to dream about his ambitions."
 matkovsky.smuta.7.a: "Ambitious goals for an ambitious man."

 matkovsky.smuta.8.desc: "\"You're listening to Radio Free Magadan. Giving you the latest news that those communist bastards don't want you to hear. I'm Vasily-\"\n\n\"-And I'm Sergei, giving the latest news on the Smuta, as our glorious nation liberates Russia one town at a time.\"\n\n\"In recent news, a small detachment of soldiers have recently secured a small town on the Border of Amur, liberating it from the Nazi-loving scum. Why I think this calls for a drink of celebration!\"\n\n\"You've got that right, Vasily. Upon seeing their liberators, the town's inhabitants graciously showered the soldiers with rewards. Everything from vodka, to food and jewelry, was handed out. Boy, those country folk are real nice.\"\n\n\"I agree, Sergei! In similar news, President Matkovsky has recently announced a new program to help rebuild the countryside. State funds and resources will be distributed to those who cooperate with the government.\"\n\n\"Is that so? Well, it sounds like a great boon for those out in the wilderness. Certainly, nothing the traitors outside of Magadan would be generous enough to give. Why, if I were one of those fine country folk, I'd be running to my liberators with Yagoda's head just for the reward.\"\n\n\"You could say that, Vasily. Well, this concludes the evening news from Radio Free Magadan, this is Sergei-\"\n\n\"-And Vasily signing off.\""

 matkovsky.smuta.9.t: "From Shore to Shore, Sea to Sea"
 matkovsky.smuta.9.desc: "The clanking of boots on metal rang out throughout the ship. Young men rushed up to the deck at the news they had reached Russia. Peter was one of these, who had signed up for adventure in Magadan as the government there had advertised. As he finally laced his boots, he rose from where he sat to join his fellow volunteers.\n\nA blinding light was the first thing to greet the volunteer as he stepped on deck. However, its visage was rapidly replaced by the image of the coast. Gray-dull rocks just out from the coast, broken up only by the occasional wisping trails of snow and ice. Further, ahead a city could be made out, the legendary port of Magadan, but it was as dull and grey as the scenery surrounding it.\n\nPeter leaned on the railing in shock in a fashion identical to that of his peers. Brochures had promised an expansive mass of natural beauty that would be the land they would help reclaim. Instead, they got a wasteland that made Nunavut seem colorful. Peter's heart slowly sank as he grasped what he had gotten himself into.\n\nEventually, the container ship docked, and with it, the poor young souls disembarked. On Magadan's rotting piers, Peter saw vessels breaking the ice of the harbor to make way for ships to escape the snowy tundra. An escape he and the other men could only dream of. As they shambled their way across the port they eventually reached their new tormenter, the supposed leader of the RFP.\n\nHe greeted them with an energy that had long left the sorry men. \"Ah, how good it is to finally meet. Welcome to Russia! I hope the trip was not too uncomfortable. Come, there is much we need to prepare you for.\" The group followed behind the overjoyed men, but for people like Peter, their minds still lingered on the immeasurable disappointment at the whole situation."
 matkovsky.smuta.9.a: "No one made eye contact with them."
 matkovsky.smuta.10.t: "A Letter From America"
 matkovsky.smuta.10.desc: "Esfir Kiseleva was the name attached to an envelope received by Galina. It was a name the old lady had not heard in years. The last time she heard it was attached to a little girl dragged along by her parents to America and that was more than 15 years ago. Now in her trembling hands was a link to someone she had long thought lost.\n\nImpatiently, Galina tore the envelope revealing a pocket watch, a letter, and some money. The watch was of fine craftsmanship. Meanwhile, the money in question was American. An unfortunate folly, the old woman thought, but the thought was excellent and there were places in town that were willing to exchange currencies. However, what intrigued Galina most though was the letter.\n\nHer eyes slowly scanned the white paper with care. \"Dear Babushka, I hope this letter finds you safe. I know it has been a while since we have seen each other and mother and father were not fond of communicating, but here I am. We have been fine in America and doing alright all things considered.\n\n\"I currently live in New York. It is a busy place, far from what life is like for you back in Russia. There are so many cars and buildings. Time Square feels unreal at times with the noise of millions walking through it each day. I currently work retail, in a jewelry store. That is how I was able to get the watch. I hope someday I can return to you when things are safer. Love, Esfir.\"\n\nGalina could not believe what she had read. At first, joy filled her at the news, before fear took over at the last few words. Quickly, she hastily grabbed a piece of paper and pencil but stopped after writing her name. East Siberia was a sleepy place, but it had grown more wakeful and anxious since her granddaughter had been here. Stuck in her contemplation, Galina turned to look at the window, searching the land outside for answers."
 matkovsky.smuta.10.a: "Meanwhile, the wind drowned out her frustrations."
 werbellsmuta.1.t: "The More Things Change"
 werbellsmuta.1.desc: "A squabbling bunch of thugs, buffoons and reactionaries was what most Magadanians saw the Fascist Party for. A gang of rejects from Harbin that couldn't even hold their own party together. It was no surprise that few had any objection to the fall of it.\n\nWhile Magadan was never the loveliest place to live - being a transit hub for slave camps, the fascist stain further darkened the city. At least the NKVD had the veneer of discipline. Most of the blackshirts used to be street thugs!\n\nA blackshirt stood on nearly every street corner, harassing locals and enforcing the constantly shifting party line, and Nina was nearing her wit's end. She trudged the streets every day, head down, trying not to make eye contact with them, often knowing that she'd be screamed at anyway. 'Degenerate!' was one of the more common phrases, and one of the kinder ones. She was constantly questioned where she was headed, who she would be with - and if the thugs were unhappy in any way, she'd be thrown back home.\n\nSo when a mysterious American Expat waltzed into Magadan, she was the first to rejoice. For a week, the streets of Magadan felt alive again, or as alive as a half-frozen industrial hellscape could be. But days later, the familiar returned, a different uniform sure, a slightly different vocabulary - but ultimately the same men behind them.\n\nNina still found herself harassed, questioned and demeaned, dare she mutter anything under her breath. She knew that it would be debated within the populace whether they were being dealt with by a lighter hand. To some, it might be different. To Nina, though, in the end, almost nothing had changed."
 werbellsmuta.1.a: "And far more remained the same"
 werbellsmuta.2.t: "Under New Management"
 werbellsmuta.2.desc: "Most in Magadan were perplexed when the eccentric Mitchell WerBell III set up shop in town. In the weeks prior, a menagerie of equally strange characters began to walk the streets, speaking in tongues that few could understand. The American's agenda was indiscernible to most, but whatever it was - it was certainly being rapidly implemented.\n\nAside from the sudden influx of foreign ships, the most noticeable change was the vanishing of the Blackshirts from the streets. They were a plague on the streets, and terrorized the populace - making the frozen prison transport town somehow more insufferable than it was. They were more than comfortable harassing anyone who deviated from the ever-changing party-line - and whoever the individual goon decided they had a vendetta against on the day.\n\nNina, someone who resisted the fascists when they arrived in Magadan - couldn't tolerate their antics any longer. She wouldn't walk the streets alone. Otherwise, she'd risk them pinning her down or following her home - listening to every word, striking at any utterance that could be perceived as threatening the regime.\n\nSo she was the first to celebrate when one day, she awoke to streets empty of any signs of the RFPs henchman. People wondered and gossiped about where they could have vanished to. Some said and hoped they'd been purged, shot and buried. Others that they'd fled for other reasons.Nina particularly hoped for the former.\n\nMost thought they'd just been straightened out by the new regime, and sent on their way to reclaim the motherland - more specifically, on the front lines. Regardless, with one small act, no matter the ultimate reason, a few in Magadan started to - if cautiously - believe in their new, unorthodox ruler's benevolence."
 werbellsmuta.2.a: "What's the catch?"
 werbellsmuta.3.t: "Planespotting"
 werbellsmuta.3.desc: "Barnaby marveled at the airstrip in front of him; a museum filled from terminal to taxiway with almost every model of plane he could name. Of course, there was the Hawker Hurricane resting along a runway, one that he'd had had plenty of experience with it over the English channel. He could spot a Ju-87, too a short distance further, bringing back fond memories of his time over the Congo Basin in Zentralafrika.\n\n\"Pretty Sweet, isn't it, Felipe\"? Barnaby said to his friend.\n\n\"For the last time, it's Federico!\" Federico replied, with an exasperated sigh. \"And no! This is awful. I can spot at least twenty models here. Twenty! I can barely repair your Hawker, let alone whatever this...\" he gestured at a nearby bomber. \"Whatever this Argentinian monstrosity is. How did we even get our hands on this?\"\n\n\"I'm sure it'll be fine, Fred,\" he patted the mechanic on the shoulder confidently. \"I bet they all look the same on the inside.\"\n\n\"No, they don't!\" yelled Federico, \"I don't know where the hell we're going to get parts to fix half of these! We're best to sell it all for scrap at this point!\n\nBarnaby smiled, unbothered by the display. \"We'll work it out Fred. You always do.\"\n\n\"You best hope I can,\" Federico muttered, opening his toolkit, and preparing to tackle the very large task in front of him. \"Otherwise you're not making it fifty feet off the runway!\" Barnaby smiled, and turned to leave his friend to his work - giving one final wave as he departed."

 werbellsmuta.4.t: "Relics in the Snow"
 werbellsmuta.4.desc: "\"Smaller than I expected, Isaiah. I was told that these Tigers were at least a kilometre wide and two tall! This is a moving cage.\" Arkady grinned at nobody in particular, pinching a cigarette between his teeth. He'd be better off selling his cigarettes than chomping them, but relief was a commodity that was in chronically short supply. Siberia was a land where keeping your sanity was a war all in itself.\n\n\"You're an old man, but not senile.\" Isaiah's voice rang from underneath the tank. His pressed grey jumpsuit betrayed its age. Maybe he was proud of it, Arkady thought. Or maybe ironing was the only thing he had, apart from fixing and drinking whatever he could find. It did not matter. \"This thing was a real terror back in it's day. Not quite a wonder weapon though, eh? How do you think it ended up here? On the other side of the world?\"\n\nArkady surveyed the rest of the junkyard. Dotted throughout the field, there were tanks of all shapes and sizes. Everything from T-34's to Lees to Matildas. Even some newer ones that he didn't recognise. If they weren't rusted, broken memoirs to a World aflame, it would have been beautiful, like a broken Roman statue in a museum. The wounds told a story of their own, even if it was one that the artist never wanted spoken. The Americans wanted Armour for their little venture to the West. They would get it.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure what the Americans expect from this?\" Arkady said. \"Putting them together seems like a sure way to lose them, doesn't it? I still get paid for fixing them, so it doesn't matter to me. Only matters if I get hung by the Communists or - god forbid - those maniacs out past the Urals.\"\n\n\"You aren't going to be the ones driving them, Isaiah. I am.\" Arkday spat out his cigarette and crushed the remains. Putting one hand in his coat pocket, he felt for his old friend. Bringing it out, he checked the magazine's content - never a bullet less than full - and slammed it back in. Maybe it was time that these old machines got back into service."
