 JAP_takagi_prime_minister_takagi_desc:0 "遂に翼賛会の改革派、自由派の大義が実を結び、高木惣吉が国会における十分な賛成多数を確保し新政権を樹立した。権限を与えられた彼の為政は日本と共栄圏の目に映るだろう。提督の公約通り、露骨な汚職、政府権限の乱用、過度の軍国主義の時代は終わりを迎える。\n\nだが、日本の国家装置は厄介な獣であり、躓かないよう慎重に改革を進めねばならない。もし躓きでもすれば、この機運は潰れてしまう。されど提督が時と場に合わせた最適なカードを切ることが出来れば、日本社会の長期的な改革を目にすることができ、過去の過ちを一掃することが出来る。"
 JAP_new_beginning:0 "翼賛会の新たなる始まり"
 JAP_new_beginning_desc:0 "大政翼賛会は大規模で、難儀、そして融通の効かない獣のような政治組織であり、保守派から改革派、技術官僚派と狡猾な無所属まで派閥主義によって千差万別に分かれている。だが残念なことに日本における唯一の合法な政治組織であり、国会議員の大半がこの組織に属している。提督の初期における行政は翼賛会の脆弱性を利用することが必要であり、国会を厳しく監督することは長丁場を見据えても、同輩の議員たちの支持を得ることにも繋がるだろう。"
 JAP_problem_sectarianism:0 "派閥主義の問題"
 JAP_problem_sectarianism_desc:0 "翼賛会はただの厄介な獣ではなく、自由主義者、技術官僚、保守主義者と無所属という派閥ごとに相対する四頭のヒドラである。そして中でも軍の笏が我々の頭上に掲げられている。\n\nだが我々は、誰に訴えかけるか、どのようにカードを切るかによってこの内紛で有利に立ち回ることができる。正しいアプローチを正しい手法で派閥主義を我々の反対派に差し向け、我々の益になるかもしれない。\n\n最も重要なのは誰と同盟を結び、誰を犬の餌にするかである。大まかに言えば、違いはあれど、過激で予測不可能な木戸派や技術官僚派と比べて、比較的穏健な池田率いる保守派が我々に最も賛同する可能性が高い。"
 JAP_cooperation_and_compromise:0 "協力と妥協"
 JAP_cooperation_and_compromise_desc:0 "我々には国会の他派閥に対して軽度に対応し同時に国会の外の我々の支持者達の理想主義の影響力を利用するという選択肢もある。この目標を達成するには我々は我々の改革主義を協力と妥協を他の国会議員達と協力し推進していく必要がある。しかしこの方法は改革の縮小につながるだろう－－この道を我々が歩むなら他派閥との調整をより密接に行う必要がある。"
 JAP_reconciling_and_reformism:0 "改革主義の調和"
 JAP_reconciling_and_reformism_desc:0 "我々の派閥と技術官僚の要素は同じ視点を共有している。改革・再編をしなければ日本は滅びるという視点だ。しかし、我々は、技術官僚と行動の方法や目的が大きく異なっている。\n\n国家機構の合理化など、革新官僚と妥協することで、大部分を占める穏健な技術官僚の支持を得ることができるが、その中にはもしかしたら岸の手下もいるかもしれない。またそのような抜本的な改革は、貴族院の支持と軍部の怒りを買うことが火を見るよりも明らかだ。"
 JAP_unified_resistance:0 "統一された反発"
 JAP_unified_resistance_desc:0 "我々は井野、池田の保守派や軍部に反対する独立心の強い技術官僚派を利用することもできる。どんなに我々と目的と手段が異なるものであれ我々が国会で一致団結することは双方に利益をもたらすだろう。言うまでもなくそうなれば国会の政治情勢は一新されることになる。大規模な -このような大規模で弱い戦線は、間違いなく政策で衝突したり間違いなく意見の相違につながるだろうが今は保守派を追い出すのが先でその後に我々の相違点を整理すべきだろう。"
 JAP_continuing_the_legacy:0 "遺産の存続"
 JAP_continuing_the_legacy_desc:0 "提督が掲げる改革と自由化の壮大な計画は目新しいものではない。実際、それは明治天皇や大正天皇の頃への回帰であり、自由と抑制、伝統的な価値観と外国の価値観との間で慎重にバランスをとったものであると主張することができる。そのため、明治・大正時代の良い面を活かし、その延長線上にある提督政治を推し進めることができる。\n\nこのように改革を推進すれば、慎重派や強硬派の衆議院議員や貴族院議員にもアピールできることは間違いないが、何よりも軍国主義の行き過ぎで失われた時代や倫理観をアピールすることで、国民からの支持を保つことができるだろう。"
 JAP_appealing_to_kokutai:0 "国体の主張"
 JAP_appealing_to_kokutai_desc:0 "明治天皇、大正天皇の輝かしい時代の遺産に訴えるとともに、日本の主権の本質であり、社会を統治するための正当な手段である国体の強化の手段として、我々が政権を握ることを提示することができる。\n\nそのためには、改革派の努力を古き良き時代への回帰、透明性の強化、社会不安の克服、国体の本義に基づく新たな黄金時代の到来として提示し、同時に軍国主義者や保守派の行き過ぎを否定していくことが必要である。"
 JAP_strength_and_totality:0 "強さと総合力"
 JAP_strength_and_totality_desc:0 "もちろん、我々の派閥を自分たちの道を切り開くことができる派閥として投影することもできる。日本には改革が必要であり、保守派が選んだ道を続けることは、国体が汚され、日本の国民にとって重要なものを剥奪されることを確実にするだろう。\n\nもっとも、衆議院や貴族院のすべての人がこれに満足するわけではないが、裏取引に振り回されることなく、我々が意図した改革の範囲と全体を決定する自由が得られるだろう。"
 JAP_appeal_disillusioned:0 "幻滅に対する訴え"
 JAP_appeal_disillusioned_desc:0 "この連立の道を始めることができれば、国会のならず者を排除することができる。特に、岸や賀屋が掲げた道に幻滅したり、反対したりしている技術官僚の取り込みを手配することができるだろう。加えて、井野の保守派の大連立は鵺のように複雑な組織であり、少なくない体制派が内部に含まれていることが予想される。最後に、独立心の強い議員、特に派閥主義に飽き飽きした議員を取り入れることができる。改革法案を確実に成立させるために、一人一人が多数派になるように努力していくであろう。"
 JAP_solidify_base:0 "ベースを固める"
 JAP_solidify_base_desc:0 "国会議員の中でも現状に幻滅した人間や説得が容易な人間を我々の傘下に加え、我々は国会内の自由派を結束させることに集中すべきだ。ここでいくらかの宴会を開き、釣りやヨットので休暇を楽しませれば我々は改革路線を押し出し、十分な多数派で余裕を持って批判と投票を行うことができるかもしれない。\n\n勿論我々の勢力が大きくなればなるほど、技術官僚や保守派そして軍部が我々の支持に激怒する危険は比較的に高まるかもしれないが、我々が切り開いた道が最良の決断だったのかどうかは時が経てばわかるだろう。"
 JAP_end_siege_mentality:0 "包囲精神の終焉"
 JAP_end_siege_mentality_desc:0 "日本の富と繁栄は、まさに戦争によって築き上げられたものであり、この二十年間、軍国主義、敵対心、外国人排斥の文化がこの国の隅から隅までに浸透している。朝鮮人労働者に対する都市部での暴動や長年に渡る大本営の性急な性格が常に存在を知らしめてきた。これは戦時体制には適しているかもしれないが我々はもはやその立場にはない。\n\nその為、日本国内だけでなく世界に向け平和、繁栄、開放性を推進することを我々の政策であると定義するのだ。これは一部の派閥からは不評を招くだろうが、開放的で透明な政府の新時代をもたらすだろう。"
 JAP_appropriating_reformism:0 "改革主義の適正化"
 JAP_appropriating_reformism_desc:0 "技術官僚派は国会内で非常に強力な派閥であり井野、池田の保守派に我々と同様に強く反対している。問題は彼らと我々とで政府組織の定義や改革、再構築の方法の解釈が信じられないほどに異なる解釈をしていることだ。\n\n我々は彼らの主張する国防国家を支持するわけではないが、我々が彼らの過激ではない国有化計画の一部を採用することで彼らの出鼻を挫くことができるだろう。ーその中で特に重要なのは主要部門の国有化や財閥の影響力をそぐことだ。"
 JAP_beginning_second_phase:0 "第二段階の開始"
 JAP_beginning_second_phase_desc:0 "現在、自由派が地位と内部体制を強固にしたことで提督は次の権力統合の段階に進むことができる。すなわち池田や木戸の本拠地にどう対処するかで単に彼らを切りくずすかどうするかだ。木戸や池田の妥協案を受け入れるか逆に彼らを脇に追いやり我々の派閥が主導権を握るか、どちらかを選択しなければならない。"
 JAP_coalition_equals:0 "平等な連合"
 JAP_coalition_equals_desc:0 "池田や木戸と連立することは、軍国主義者や強硬派に対抗する幅広い統一戦線として我々の派閥が国会で生き残るための安全な道だろう。しかし、長期的に生き残る為にはそのほうがいいのかもしれないがそうすれば我々の改革政策を縮小しなければいけないのは間違いない。\n\n少なくとも、池田の強大な派閥は、我々が法案を通過させるのに十分な議席を確保させることは間違いないだろう。しかしこれでは妥協のし過ぎで成果がないということに成り兼ねないだろう。"
 JAP_settling_differences:0 "我々の違いを解決する"
 JAP_settling_differences_desc:0 "改革派と保守派、木戸派の皇道派の間には経済や軍事そして共栄圏の広大な繁栄と富をどのように治めるかに、様々な違いがある。しかし我が連合が改革を推進し、軍国主義者の影響力を断つためには急進的な改革を犠牲にしてでも、軍部と井野政権の暴走に反対するという共通の認識のもとに団結せねばならない。\n\nこれを踏まえ、改革派だけではなく、保守派や皇道派も含めた大連立を立ち上げることが目的だ。"
 JAP_ending_sectarian_intrigue:0 "セクト間の陰謀の終結"
 JAP_ending_sectarian_intrigue_desc:0 "裏取引、コネ、社内政治、狡猾、賄賂。これら全てが井野政権では行われていた手段だ。透明性の欠如、汚職、行政の混乱につながる提督が嫌うやり方だ。\n\nその提督の彼の顧問は汚い政治工作や賄賂の経歴を持つ議員を悪質なものから順に調べてていくのだ。彼らは従うほかないだろう。抵抗すればもうすぐ支持者が過半数を超える国会で、彼らの政治キャリアは終わってしまうのだから。"
 JAP_collaborate_with_ikeda:0 "池田との連携"
 JAP_collaborate_with_ikeda_desc:0 "池田正之輔は執念深い男だ。厳格な保守主義者で、気性が荒く、最も国会で力を持つ派閥のリーダーだ。我々自由派と保守派との間には、政策の折り合いがつかないかもしれないが、技術官僚と軍国主義者を抑制するという目的に置いては意見が一致している。\n\n我々は軍国主義を抑制する重要な法案を成立させる為に、彼らに協力を求め、比較的安全な基盤を築き、より重要な問題に取り組むことができるだろう。"
 JAP_rehabilitate_kido:0 "木戸の復帰"
 JAP_rehabilitate_kido_desc:0 "木戸幸一は多くの遺産を持つ人物だ。一方で、我々の自由主義的主張は、彼が戦後に計画した軍部の非政治からから着想を得ている。その一方で彼は軍国主義者や技術官僚の激しい不評を買ったことで悲惨な退任を迎えた。現在、彼は国会で我々の派閥に協力を求めており、彼の申し出を断る理由はないだろう。彼の皇室や貴族院とのつながりは支持を得るためには不可欠だ。\n\nその代わり、提督は自身のイメージを回復させることが賢明だろう。その為には、国会答弁や翼賛会新聞や新聞の取材で彼の努力を認めなければならない。願わくば、この老人が生き残り、日本国民の前で贖罪を果たせることを。"
 JAP_accessing_our_coalition:0 "連立への接近"
 JAP_accessing_our_coalition_desc:0 "池田政之輔とその派閥と連立を組むことに疑問を持つ人間は少なくない。保守派から独立した我々の出自を考えれば、それも無理はないが今となれば、この同盟は賢明な選択と言えるだろう。高木首相の優れたリーダーシップにより、連立政権は期待を上回る成果を上げている。保守派を抑え込むことができ、彼らの経済、社会機関との繋がりが、我々の使命を果たす上で必要なものとなった。加えて連合は帝国議会の礼節を保ち、民間人を満足させるのにも役立っている。しかし、まだ始まったばかりであり、池田氏との協力関係がどれだけの繁栄をもたらすかは未知数だ。やるべきことはまだまだ残っている。"
 JAP_takagi_on_our_own:0 "我々自身で"
 JAP_takagi_on_our_own_desc:0 "勿論、ほかの派閥との協力関係を捨てて、自らの道を切り開くこともできるだろう。そうすれば政策を自由に制定できるが,当然国会での数の上では負けてしまう。\n\nこの道を歩むには、一部の派閥には強硬手段を用い、他の派閥には我々との取引を応じざる負えないように窮地に追い込むことが必要だ……説得できない国会議員の怒りを買うことは避けらないだろう。"
 JAP_piecemeal_compromises:0 "技官派との部分的な妥協"
 JAP_piecemeal_compromises_desc:0 "技術官僚派は、派閥として最も強く我々の自由主義運動に反対している。皮肉なことに改革派の個々の人物の中には、我々の派閥と簡単に妥協できる者もいるが、その結果は上手くはいかないだろう。しかし、我々の派閥の強さを考えれば、重要な政策について妥協する必要はない。\n\n我々は彼らと共通点のある部分を活用し重要ではない分野の緩い国有化や、海外にある財閥の支部の構造改革などを行い、企業の力を削いで国家機関が有利になるようにすべきだ。結果として技術官僚の一部を満足して彼らが我々に対して強固な戦線を形成するのを防ぐことになるだろう。"
 JAP_strengthening_our_agreements:0 "協定の強化"
 JAP_strengthening_our_agreements_desc:0 "我々改革派は主に、学生と帝国海軍という二つの大きく異なる2つの派閥から支持を得ている。双方の支持基盤は、提督の政権の最終目標に同意しているが、便宜上の同盟であり、井野時代の惨状を終わらせたいという共通の願いで結ばれている。\n\n我々は、後方の発行や取材、支持基盤の代表者と対話や議論を重ねることで、一般支持者の異なる関心を結びつけることができれば我々の法案に対する強力な民衆の支持を得ることができ、上手くいけば他の国会の派閥の民衆支持を打ち砕くことが出来るだろう。"
 JAP_merging_ikedas_camp:0 "池田派との合流"
 JAP_merging_ikedas_camp_desc:0 "池田正之輔は執念深い男だ。厳格な保守主義者で、気性が荒く、そして何より最も国会で力を持つ派閥のリーダーだ。少なくとも、井野政権が崩壊し、保守派が弱体化し、自由派が強大化する前の数週間前まではそうだった。\n\n池田とその一派を窮地に追い込むことで、彼の協力を簡単に得ることが出来るだろう。提督は池田に、我々に協力することが国会で生き残る唯一の方法であると説得することができるだろう。そうしなければ技官派に隙を与えることになり。これは我々にとって望ましい結果名だけではなく池田氏のような保守派の崩壊した勢力にも望ましい結果ではないはずだ。"
 JAP_incorporate_kido:0 "木戸を取り込む"
 JAP_incorporate_kido_desc:0 "木戸幸一は多くの遺産を持つ人物だ。一方で、我々の自由主義的主張は、彼が戦後に計画した軍部の非政治からから着想を得ている。その一方で彼は軍国主義者や技術官僚の激しい不評を買ったことで悲惨な退任を迎えた。しかし彼のような人物を取り入れないのは馬鹿げている。\n\n彼の派閥の人数は最も少ないが、木戸と協力することで、皇室や貴族院との接触が可能になり、国会が膠着状態になれば必要なテコ入れが可能で、必要であれば天皇陛下の個人的な意見をお伺いすることが出来る。"
 JAP_dealing_with_others:0 "他党への対処"
 JAP_dealing_with_others_desc:0 "これまで我々は我々の能力を証明するために懸命に働き公平で積極的な政府であることを示してきた。それが奏して我々の国民からの支持は大幅に上がり、他の派閥の評判はやや落ちてきている。我々が唯一の実行力があり立派な政府であるという評価を得るためには、野党の評価を下げる努力をしなければならない。\n\n首相は、他の派閥を腐敗した無能で危険な存在であるというキャンペーンを全面的に行うことを命じた。その為には何の捏造の必要もない。我々は多くの証拠を手に入れており、後はそれを国民に見せるだけだ。同時に他の派閥が誰と関係を持っているのかを国民に知らせ、彼らの真の忠誠心を明らかにするのだ。他の派閥が大日本帝国に屈辱的な衰退をもたらすことしかできないことを知らしめるのだ。"

 JAP_the_sun_rises_once_more_desc:0 "現在、我々は政治基盤を整え、汚職をなくすことに尽力し、日本社会の強迫観念を終わらせ戦時中の行き過ぎた行為を抑制した。未来は明るく、それは提督の手で切り光られた未来だ。我々は経済的な面に目を向け経済の調整と適切な技術の研究を行う。勿論将来的なメリットがある。国体の真髄たる実力、努力、プロフェショナリズムのある未来だ。"
 JAP_push_for_normalcy:0 "平時への要求"
 JAP_push_for_normalcy_desc:0 "我が国の最大の勝利は20年ほど前にアメリカとその帝国主義者の同盟国に勝利をしたことだろう。しかし、我々の厄介な政府は戦争が終わったという事実を認識していないかのようであり、多くの戦時法や政策が今でも日本の生活の一部となっている。\n\nこれらにより、戦時中の動員による非効率性や硬直性が現代にいたるまで続いており、共栄圏が提供する経済的な利益や特権を十分に活用することができないという問題を起こしている。最も重要なことは、国民の物質的な要求が高まるにつれ、反対意見が増えていることだ。我々の政権が国民の支持を得て進むためには、この問題を解決する必要がある。\n\n中曽根康弘大臣は、戦時中の規制を段階的に撤廃し、日本が市場の力を最大限に発揮できるようにするという壮大な計画を打ち出している。"
 JAP_curtail_wartime_privileges:0 "戦時下特権を縮小"
 JAP_curtail_wartime_privileges_desc:0 "The Zaibatsu and Keiretsu have enjoyed close cooperation with the state ever since the industrialisation of Japan in the late 19th century - a relationship which we would be wise to maintain positively, even amidst our liberalization programs. However, it is also undeniable that wartime contracts and subsidies have taken a decent toll on our balance of payments, putting our fiscal situation in dangerous zones if we don't watch our step.\n\nHence, it would be necessary for us to terminate some of the more... outrageous wartime subsidies and contracts - ostensibly a means to improve our balance of payments, but it would be a step in the right direction to start dismantling the incredible grip the Zaibatsu and Keiretsu have over our stagnating economy."
 JAP_grease_the_gears:0 "歯車に油を注す"
 JAP_grease_the_gears_desc:0 "規制緩和は気まぐれだし、何十年も続いた企業連合を少しずつ解消していくのは非常に危険である。しかし、国益の観点からも企業の収益性の観点からも、民営化が理想的であることを徐々に納得させていくことができるだろう。そのために、中曽根大臣は財閥や企業間組織の関係者と会い、規模の不経済から脱却することで長期的には収益性が高まることを具体的に説明する。\n\nもちろん、論理と数学（そして非常に寛大な民間の研究開発助成金）で企業を説得できなければ、もっと水面下で企業を政権の意向に従わせる手段があるかもしれない。\n\nしかし、中曽根大臣は経済学の専門家であり、大企業との交渉の専門家でもあるのだから、彼にその手段を委ねるのが賢明であろう。"
 JAP_easing_nationalization:0 "国有化緩和"
 JAP_easing_nationalization_desc:0 "While negotiations with firms themselves would be a tricky affair, our administration will have a freer hand in easing the nationalization of assets and firms which are already under government control. Cutting away unprofitable assets would be a good start, especially ones in far-flung regions such as Central China and the South Pacific.\n\nIn addition, chipping away at the Sangyo Hokokukai to chip away at the legacy of the National Mobilization Law would also increase our standing with the corporations - with no union dues to increase labor costs, even though the Sangyo Hokokukai is merely a puppet.\n\nWhile this move would increase the support we receive from private businesses, it would definitely draw the ire of the military and the technocrats, who would definitely be opposed to the loosening of the state's grip over industries and assets."
 JAP_privatize_the_railways:0 "鉄道民営化"
 JAP_privatize_the_railways_desc:0 "太平洋に平和が訪れると、朝鮮や台湾だけでなく、他の地域にも領土を拡大することができた。そのために、旧政権は、主に軍の需要を満たすために国有鉄道の建設を大々的に行った。しかし、現在の経済状況のように、これらの資産はほとんど利益を上げることができなかった。\n\n鉄道網全体を民営化することは、多くの路線が軍事的に重要であることを考えると賢明ではないが、日本国内での民営化に着手することは可能である。中曽根大臣は、東京都心の地下都市を実験材料にして、将来的には大規模な民営化を行うという計画を持っている。"
 JAP_returning_seized_assets:0 "押収した資産の返還"
 JAP_returning_seized_assets_desc:0 "The industrial centers of Western Japan have been the backbone of our industry, especially in the automotive and electronics industries. However, they are a drain on our state coffers, so privatizing some of these industries would be a good way to facilitate greater economic liberalization. Furthermore, it is a good opportunity for us to see the effects of privatization when applied to the unique contexts of Japan.\n\nWhile we may run into opposition from the technocrats, some of whom have argued that the automotive and electronic industries are still \"essential\" industries, our support from the moderates within the Diet should be enough to overwhelm their opposition. This move wouldn't hurt our standing with our Zaibatsu allies such as Mitsubishi, either."
 JAP_remove_the_barriers_on_trading:0 "貿易の障壁を除去"
 JAP_remove_the_barriers_on_trading_desc:0 "The Co-Prosperity Sphere, while designed to foster Asian economic development (naturally, under our very close oversight) is still very much facing wartime restrictions courtesy of previous administrations. Moreover, some local army garrisons have vested interests in ensuring their chokeholds through black market dominance and off-the-books provisions remain untouched. While this benefits the pockets of individuals, it does not benefit Japan - in fact, it hurts our ability to placate the populace of the Sphere's member states.\n\nHence, our cabinet has proposed to lift wartime trading and resource restrictions in order to facilitate a liberalised flow of goods and capital - allowing for our businesses to thrive and fully capitalise on the immense resource wealth the Sphere offers. From Beijing to Bengkulu, Japanese business will flourish - and so will the Japanese people."
 JAP_keep_hold_of_key_industries:0 "重要産業を掌握"
 JAP_keep_hold_of_key_industries_desc:0 "提督の政権の長期的な目標は、日本経済の自由化を進めることであるが、あまりにも多くの分野を一度に自由化することは、経済の不確実性を高め、圏全体の市場に衝撃を与えることになる。したがって、防衛、鉄鋼、石油化学などのいくつかの重要な産業の株式を維持することが賢明であると考えられる。\n\nまた、中曽根大臣は、技術官僚や軍部を味方につけて、経済の自由化を進めていくための手段として、トヨタの効率的な生産方式に影響を受けた自動化や流れ作業などの新技術の研究開発を進め、前述の産業の生産能力を向上させることを考えている技術官僚の理念を逆手に取った経済運営は、技術官僚の風上にも置けるものである。"
 JAP_maintain_resource_dominance:0 "資源支配を主張"
 JAP_maintain_resource_dominance_desc:0 "その代わりに、資源採掘業界の全体に国が指を入れておくことに注力することもできる。民営化を進めるよりも危険は少ない。国はすでに資源採掘産業の資産のかなりの部分を支配しており、南太平洋や外満洲などの遠隔地ではほぼ独占できることが保証されているからだ。\n\nもちろん、国家による完全な支配は、長期的には我々にとって望ましくない。だからこそ、中曽根大臣は財閥関係者と一緒に緊急計画を考える必要がある。将来の民営化の入札では、財閥は暗黙のうちに優先権を与えられ、現在の国家の拡張には、その専門知識を活用することになる。"

 JAP_a_question_of_labor_desc:0 "Romusha, Maruta, Chinese, Indonesian, Korean - all work for the benefit of Japan. From the coal mines of Kyushu to Nissan's factories in Manchuria, labor - forced and participatory - has been crucial to the betterment of the Japanese economy and people. However, with a modernizing economy comes a new challenge for our labor pool - mechanization and automation necessitates a greater need to modernize the skills of our labor pool.\n\nWe could consider the reduction of our reliance on forced labor, simultaneously reducing the dissent within the Sphere and improving our public image both within Japan and without. We should not keep our fingers out of requisitioned labour entirely - their contributions to jobs the average Japanese person would not touch are still crucial, for the time being. In addition, keeping labor costs on the low end definitely wouldn't hurt our standing with the Zaibatsu and keiretsu. After all, with the presence of our security forces, striking laborers will have little luck or leverage."

Their triumphs are signs of Japan's economic prowess and prosperity. In turn, however, they also need to be fed themselves with a steady diet of labor and natural resources. Allowing the Zaibatsu and keiretsu to maintain their free hand over labor requisitioning across the Sphere would definitely keep our administration in their good books in addition to maintaining the temporary approval of the conservatives.\n\nThis would not look good in the eyes of the public, though. The progressives wish to curtail the usage of forced labor, and the ultranationalists wish for the state to have a greater say in the usage of forced labor. In addition, we also could run into the risk of angering our collaborators within the Sphere - exploitation of their people for our own gain is not the most ideal or agreeable thing there is."

We have spent a good deal of time ensuring that the industry of the Home Islands operates according to the highest of standards. New safety measures have been implemented, including through examinations of machines and tools before use and intensive training to better handle workplace accidents. Much work has also been done to ensure the industrial sector operates with full energy and production efficiency.\n\nWhile our efforts at home have proved fruitful, the new practices have yet to be implemented across the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

In addition, while we have won the war and claimed our mantle as the liberator of East Asia, the Japanese people have not benefited from the fruits of the Sphere.\n\nHence, with our majority in the Diet secured and with sufficient backing from the House of Peers, the Admiral will make moves to restore normalcy in the Home Islands, starting with mobilization laws and then moving on to further economic and social deregulation. A bold step forward, this would definitely make waves among our popular support base, but it will also definitely earn the ire of the militarists and the bureaucrats."

While necessary twenty years ago, it has long since stopped being relevant. In particular, the Law focuses on several key sectors of Japanese society: labor unions, nationalisation of strategic industries, price controls, rationing, curfews, and media censorship, the continuation of all of which is a stranglehold on Japanese society.\n\nWe could once again push for a gradual easing of the National Mobilization Law, attacking it from the angle of unconstitutionality the way the House did nearly thirty years ago, or we could attack it from the angle of economics and financial prudence - loosening regulations and privatizing assets would do the treasury good in the long term.\n\nEither way, we must dismantle the act and then rebuild Japanese society."
 JAP_loosen_the_price_controls:0 "価格規制の緩和"
 JAP_loosen_the_price_controls_desc:0 "Wartime economics demands strong government intervention to gear the economy towards the needs of the nation, one means of which is price controls. Through the Chuo Bukka Tosei Kyoryoku Kaigi, wartime price floors and ceilings have ensured tighter government control over the prices of essential goods, but in the process have also inevitably created black markets both in rural and urban areas, proliferating crime.\n\nIn addition, the presence of price controls have also created a resource crisis within our military and defense industries as the Army and Navy compete for raw materials such as aluminium, which is also having adverse effects on civilian industry.\n\nWhile dismantling the legislation itself would be a fairly straightforward task, given the support from both the conservatives and the Kidoites, we would also have to dedicate police and Kenpeitai resources to tracking and shutting down black markets."

Our law enforcement units have done well to uphold said laws, but ever since the war ended they may have done too well. The continued fear of reprisals and prosecution from the Tokkō have generated an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, fomenting unrest among our populace.\n\nIt would be wise for us to ease the punishment clauses, the result of which would be a definite boost to our approval amongst the public. The Tokkō resources and manpower that could be freed from a relaxed policy at home could be better deployed overseas, especially in Manchukuo and China.\n\nOnce this return to normalcy is complete, Japanese society will flourish in the material and spiritual glory of our place in the sun and achieve the desired balance between freedom to flourish and respect for the rule of law."

While rightfully stifled by the National Mobilization Law through distribution and licensing restrictions, we could look into easing some of these press regulations if we wanted to.\n\nNaturally, we should be able to shore up our public support through easing these press regulations, but there is also a second, less apparent purpose in deregulating the press: namely the purpose of weaponizing it against our opponents in the diet, be it through candid interviews, honest audits of corruption, or even some... sensationalized news pieces.\n\nAfter all, media coverage and exposure is a double-edged sword."

The expansion of the Education Ministry would be focused on increasing educational quality and training, especially in rural areas, as well as branching out to Japanese communities throughout the Sphere so that these loyal sons and daughters of Nihon could be on par with their compatriots back home.\n\nIn addition, we would also spare some expenses for a commission to rejuvenate the national syllabi to fit the renewed strength and totality of Japan in this post-war era."

In return for the increases in approved media outlets, it would be wise for us to propose the broadcasting of propaganda in some time slots.\n\nThis could be radio broadcasts and television segments about how the Sphere is prospering under our benevolent hand, movies which extol the positive spirit of Japanese nationalism, or more. All this is a new, benevolent form of positive propaganda which portrays the Pan-Asian ideal - hopefully this will help calm dissent amongst our population."

Starting from our own citizens, we ought to redefine the national syllabi to include lessons about the benevolence ofJapan towards the Sphere and how Pan-Asianism can only be achieved through Japan's leadership.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Education is also looking at the possibility of increasing overseas education investments - provided that they allow Japanese educators to hold advisory roles in redefining and implementing compulsory education. Japanese customs and practices such as the singing of Kimigayo and compulsory Japanese language lessons would be a must for these education investments.\n\nOne day, Asia will fully realise the benevolence of the Japanese hand."

Where once, the young and inspired Japanese youth would be sent off to serve in Imperial Armed Forces, many are now able to dedicate themselves to improving Japan through science, emerging industries, and new technologies. Relaxations on criminal law and press restrictions have eased the fears of the populace, especially for those who remember the days of the Taishō era.\n\nWhile these very palpable changes are significant, especially for the general population, we cannot now lie back and consider our own work done.

Therefore, we must put a stop to it immediately. Prime Minister Takagi was, and still is, one of the few that will attempt to rid the Empire of this cancer.

There is no room for that sort of behaviour in the Prime Minister's new Japan, nor is there any room for failing to uncover it. In the coming weeks, political, noble, and intellectual circles will all be thoroughly investigated, leaving none of their documents, safes, or bank accounts unexamined. Once we have gathered enough evidence of their grafts, we will not hesitate to make them public knowledge, nor will we shy away from offering rewards to those that can provide us with more information.

One choice of where to start is to target the military, its various overseas holdings, and members of the technocrat faction. Our other choice is to investigate the conservative and reformist sections of the Imperial Diet as well as a number of government-controlled ports and warehouses. Either of these choices could serve to benefit Prime Minister Takagi's other aims, providing evidence of why our reforms are so vital.

This means that not even the cabinet is safe from the web of corruption that infests Japanese society.\n\nThe Prime Minister cannot be expected to work effectively when his closest associates have potentially been bought out by his rivals. A quick and ruthless purge of the cabinet will take place, with the purpose of eliminating anyone corrupt or even at risk of falling to said vice.

However, their membership among the nobility does not mean that the peers are above accepting bribes or engaging in other corrupt activities. In fact, many an impoverished noble has been known to sell their political integrity in order to gain any amount of yen. That is not to say that wealthy nobles are exempt from this behaviour. Indeed, many of their number are just as guilty. This can go on for no longer. The upper house of the Imperial Diet cannot be allowed to be a nest of corruption any longer.

Criminal records seem to fade away far too quickly for these corrupt officials and businessmen. The privacy that they are afforded is a shield that Prime Minister Takagi will no longer tolerate.\n\nThe public is mostly unaware of who exactly is responsible for the corruption that grips the Empire. As we uncover more information about this epidemic, we will begin to publicize our findings. The people of Japan deserve to know exactly who is engaging in corrupt and dishonorable behaviour.

Fortunately for us, there are those who are willing to provide us with the exact information we need.

Many use their yen to live out their days in prison in relative comfort. Others have used their ill-gotten money to escape our reach. It is time that we cut them off from their power.\n\nNow, the money that they never should have accepted in the first place will be given to the state. We are sure that we can put it to better use, anyways. Without their grafts, the recently imprisoned businessmen and officials are sure to suffer the consequences of their crimes to the fullest.

Despite the inconsistent nature of their political existence, independent leader Miki Takeo is clamoring about electoral fraud.

We care little for the fate of the non-endorsed, but this is a way to set us apart from the rest of the YSK. As tedious as the Prime Minister might find the independents, he has chosen to pardon their imprisoned brethren. This will certainly irritate the rest of our party, but not without carrying a reward.

Unlike factions of the YSK, who were at least willing to subject themselves to audits for appearances' sake, the independents are fiercely distrustful of us. They see any attempt to investigate them as us an attempt to stifle their limited influence. Yet as many of the independents are immensely wealthy figures, such as Sasakawa Ryoichi, it would be wise to examine their finances.

However, the days when Japanese Communist Party posed a threat are long gone, and there has been little in the way of ideological resistance to our rule since the war.\n\nThe Tokkō spend most of their time in the present intimidating non-endorsed politicians, particularly during elections. This is by no means a secret to the general public, who see the Tokkō as a stain upon the nation's claim to democractic rule.

The Prime Minister intends to remedy this error through simple, yet significant reform. Firstly, more training will be given to poll organisers to assist them in dealing with long queues and confused citizens.

The Prime Minister, an admiral in the IJN, is well aware of the danger that the army can pose when riled up. Former Prime Minister Kido knows that perhaps more than anyone. Therefore, Prime Minister Takagi will pursue a careful and protracted investigation into the corruption of the IJA.

While the Prime Minister is a former admiral and usually counts on the navy as allies, he still wishes to go ahead with an investigation into the IJN. He wishes to remove any doubt that the public, or anyone else for that matter, might have as to whether his investigations are biased or not. While Prime Minister Takagi would rather not have to turn on his closest allies, this situation requires an exception.\n\nWe will begin an audit of all major anchorages across Japan and the Sphere. All cargo will undergo inspection by an official, and port records will be handed over to us at the end of each day. The Navy will be displeased to have their operations delayed, but the Prime Minister is certain that he can pull enough favours to soften the blow."

Neither the Prime Minister or the navy wish to see this change, but the PM does quietly admit that the IJN has become rather bloated over the years. Far too many ships are being kept in service by the admiralty despite the lull in tensions since the end of the war. Certain whispers have also reached our ears, suggesting that the navy may be misusing their extensive funds. Prime Minister Takagi has managed to convince enough of the admirals to allow for an audit of their budget, to root out any financial sinkholes. At the same time, we will be searching for any traces of corruption that the budget might hint at. Even if the Admiralty do not desire to end their illegal activities, the Prime Minister is more concerned with preserving the respectability of the organisation than appeasing their current crop."

This state of affairs is largely a result of former Prime Minister Ino's incompetent handling of army. In the wider Sphere, the army is cut loose to do as they please, much to the chagrin of anyone not in their good graces. Prime Minister Takagi's efforts to eliminate corruption have so far been mostly limited to the Home Islands. It would be wise to examine the situation in the colonies as well, as the army is surely commiting worse crimes outside of Japan. Although taking on the army is a risk, we will have the navy on our side for this investigation. It is time for the government to restore the rule of law to the colonies."

Officially, these soldiers are there to \"provide additional protection to member states of the Co-Prosperity Sphere\". In the past, we have also viewed these garrisons as an important part of keeping our presence felt in the colonies. The army, too, had reasons for maintaining the garrisons for so long. A great deal of territory and resources had been handed over to them by Prime Minister Ino, which they now cling to dearly.\n\nAlthough we would be fools to entirely trust the colonial administrations to handle themselves, many of the army garrisons do little more than sit in their barracks these days. Their presence is costly and inefficient, so the Prime Minister will be recalling them to Japan. Any opportunity to weaken the army and balance the budget is well worth committing to."

The Prime Minister is still committed to the demilitarization of the Sphere and must therefore work around or with our armed forces to achieve this goal. By utilizing the Prime Minister's connection in the Navy, we can begin to establish firmer relationships with both branches of the military. This will allow us to properly negotiate, rather than cause a diplomatic meltdown each time we attempt to curtail excess military power. Our allies within the armed forces will ensure that the branches act in a suitable manner. The military will turn its attention to defending our shores from threats from within and without. After all, what use is there in a complacent military?\n\nOnce we have the IJA and IJN off our backs, we will be able to fully focus on the Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is time our overseas possessions became proper colonies, ones that truly benefit the home islands."

In the army headquarters and in their garrisons across the Sphere, traces of corruption and deep misconduct linger on. We need only to gain access to these informants and files.\n\nFortunately, Prime Minister Takagi's experience with the navy has granted him some insight into the operations of the rival military branch.

Ino, already heavily embroiled in corruption, only allowed the issues within the party to grow worse. This is the disaster that we have inherited.\n\nThe Imperial Diet is our primary target in removing Ino's legacy. Both Houses will be targeted, and we will pay particular attention to the conservatives. Even the reformists will be investigated, as unlike with our other investigations, we must be careful that this one does not in any way come to harm our reputation.

As we have a vested interest in investigating that army group, it would be wise to infiltrate and observe their domain in the Liaodong peninsula. Fortunately for us, the civilian administration of Kwantung, the Kanto-Cho, indirectly reports to us through the Ministry of Greater East Asia.\n\nThe Prime Minister has issued a quiet directive to loyalists in Dairen to closely observe any suspicious activities of the IJA.

Those charged with the emperor's personal protection must be of the highest caliber in terms of skill and character.\n\nThe Prime Minister has received permission from the Imperial Household to carry out a series of interviews with members of the guard. This has two purposes. The first is to ensure the integrity of the guard. The second is to potentially garner information from the interviewees as to corruption in other branches of the IJA. Let us hope that the Imperial Guard has a lot more to say regarding the second topic."

He is far too likely to try to cover up the army's crimes.\n\nInstead of going to him, we will seek out our contacts in Hsinking and have them begin something of an unofficial investigation into army activity in Manchukuo. Our allies are relatively minor figures in Manchukuo, but the Prime Minister knows that this will be an advantage.

There is no better place to do this than the Kwantung Army headquarters. Located in Hsinking, the headquarters is something akin to a fortress in scale. Its imposing presence aside, it would be simple enough for a few of our agents, disguised as Kwantung soldiers, to march in, wiretap a few key locations, and then slip out before anyone notices.\n\nOnce the HQ is cracked open for us, we will be able to listen in on whatever matters the Kwantung commanders had hoped to keep private.

Both partners in the alliance grew immensely wealthy as a result of their addicted \"customers\". However, their partnership strained when the army began to favour the technocrats. While we care little for the morality of these past actions, the slow disintegration of relations between the IJA and Mitsui has the potential to be useful.\n\nThe Prime Minister intends to approach Mitsui with the offer of letting them keep their side of the profits in return for information about the army.

Now is the time to bring the full force of the government upon the IJA.\n\nThe Prime Minister has ordered an immediate seizure of army files and records, in the hopes that we will have them long before the IJA can mount a response. Whether it be an army barracks in Osaka or a colonial HQ in Shonan, our agents will be ready to take what is ours.

Yet even in their weakened state, the army and parts of the Imperial Diet still respect the words and leadership of these aged figures. Their influence is enough to warrant removal in the Prime Minister's eyes.\n\nThe Toseiha generals' connections to various corrupt officials and businessmen provides us with more than enough justification for removing them.

Still, there are men of high rank who yet resist our influence.\n\nSome have many secrets, some of which they would kill to protect.

Even now, when they are out of government, the conservatives continue to be corrupt, gladly accepting bribes in return for political favors.\n\nPrime Minister Takagi will be ordering a full scale investigation of the conservatives.

Prime Minister Takagi has no interest in walking in his predecessors footsteps and will soon begin to stamp down on bribery.

However, as time has gone by, the leadership has become quite corrupt, siphoning money from the union's treasury to fund whatever personal activities they please. The danger of riling up the workforce we seek to pacify is too great. Sampo officials must be brought back in line or else replaced.

Without an official story, rumors are likely to run wild and harm our party's reputation.\n\nPrime Minister Takagi will be making an address to the nation in order to strangle any growing rumors. He aims to make it clear that it is not the Taisei Yokusankai that is corrupt. No, the corruption comes from without.

After all, there have been plenty of corruption accusations levied against peers in the past.\n\nPrime Minister Takagi is determined to make sure that none of these allegations are a risk to his government. To surrender the House of Peers to bribery and deceit would be a defeat not worth suffering under any circumstances.

Regardless, the effects of his negligence cannot be allowed to linger.\n\nWarehouses were the home of a great deal of corruption and deliberate mismanagement during the previous administration. The sight of these buildings left empty is not something that anyone wants repeated. Therefore, the Prime Minister has hired a great number of officials to observe warehouses across Japan.

Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister has not forgotten their incompetence or any of their numerous crimes. The time has come to ensure that they never regain their status.\n\nWe have already begun talks to have some of these Inoites deselected as candidates during the next election. Once it has become clear to the rest that we have not forgotten about them, the Prime Minister will offer to speak with a few of them personally.

While the youths generally support the end of sterilisation for patients of leprosy and for inheritable conditions deemed undesirable by the public, Katō herself has been rather tight-lipped over the issue.

His ascendance through the ranks of the Taisei Yokusankai had branded him as a natural leader; stoic and composed, his unwavering commitment to the service of the Emperor had been impressed onto him during his service in the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nHe was dressed in a noble military uniform, decorated with his wartime medals and ribbons. His face was calm and still, respectful of the presence of His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Japan, throughout the ceremony. Takagi did not flinch and moved perfectly, retaining an immaculate composure during his official appointment to the position of Prime Minister; he declared determination to serve the empire to the best of his ability by honoring a righteous and just path for the nation.\n\nFew could warm up to Takagi, and even fewer had seen him smile, but all in the Diet could recall his passionate determination to lift the empire from its economic and political woes and return it to an era of prosperity and security. Now in the Prime Minister's seat, Mr. Takagi seeks to tear the corrupt and decadent camarilla from their elite positions and wipe clean the militarism that festered in the seats of the Diet so that the empire could best enjoy its peaceful reign over Asia."

The first is that of the infighting between the factions of the YSK. We need to expand our small coalition and improve its resilience against outside attack. Simultaneously, the wider party must be made to submit or comply with our national leadership, whether they like us or not.\n\nThen there is the issue of corruption, which infests every part of Imperial leadership. The state cannot be expected to function if most of its curators and guardians have sold themselves to the highest bidder. The guilty will have to be removed from power before the situation grows even more out of hand.\n\nFinally, the Prime Minister has also spoken of engaging in a series of demilitarization programs across the Sphere. The military apparatus has become bloated and tired, leeching resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. It is time that we showed some trust towards the civilian colonial administrations.

Birdsong would wake him up each morning, but he would only leave for work once the nighttime curfew had lifted. Mr. Kobayashi would be sure to try and buy his son candy on the way home, though none for himself, as prices for imports had danced in and around 'too expensive'.\n\nNormal life was said to have already returned to Japan, but it was far beyond the reach of the average citizen. Hidden behind the veil of 'National Security' and dire circumstances, these tight protocols had chained society away from healthy, happy lives.

He stood in front of the Imperial Diet and adjusted the microphone.\n\nTakagi was never a man to shy away from a risky action, but to point the finger at Konoe so aggressively was most certainly a gamble. But his wasteful programs drove Japan into the series of disasters it now faced, all so he could curry favor with those who would line his pockets. It was a silent truth that Konoe had engaged in shifty activity as Prime Minister, but Takagi's allies did not have to look too hard to see how deep the prince's rot had affected the Japanese system.\n\nAs he delivered his speech to the hundreds of representatives, Takagi gauged that the mood of the room was shifting in his favor. Quick glances saw the party hardliners dart their eyes about or glare at opponents across the hall, while the men in the more reformist cliques gave their silent approval. He paused for a second - the climax of his speech, the true figure of Konoe's recklessness. Not just in the yen squirreled away in the pockets of generals and industrial magnates, but the message it would send to any aspiring Japanese citizen. What sense of honor is there in the footsteps of such a corrupt man?\n\nThe true answer is none at all."

His face remained stiff and unbothered, and he scribbled down copied information, glancing back at the folder a few times.\n\nInstrumental for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure during the Great East Asian War, the Romusha system - even if formalized under the Indonesia Economic Development Authority, the IKKC - now assembled goods and erected buildings for the corporations, with the Zaibatsu hiring hundreds, or even thousands, at a time. They worked mindlessly as slaves to their own crimes, and their labour was a redemption in the service of the Empire.\n\nTakagi grouped the folders to one corner of his desk, and reached for another sheet of paper to begin writing to his cabinet. He debated the benefits of regulation; with adequate protections, the labourers could work harder, for longer, and see real value in their service. However, he did acknowledge the contrary - leaving the laborers to the hungry Zaibatsu, and letting the market decide who was fittest in the servitude of their country, and who would perish seeking such forgiveness."

They may have seen officers crash through the wooden doors of neighbours on their commute, or gazed with shock through the kitchen window at the beaten and bloodied bodies of nearby residents as they were dragged from their homes. As ghastly as these were, every raid began with a phone call or a tip from an informant - the responsible voice of the public, as propaganda demanded. Not to tell would be treason against the Emperor, a crime warranting unending agony, rotting in a sunlight-starved concrete cell.\n\nThe raw fear of the Kenpeitai was an ordered chaos, and the oppressive air had morphed itself into a unique hostility in Japan.

But his mind strayed back to the tropics again, though not because he was returning to the battlefield. Rather the younger Amari was to be sent there, mere weeks after he finished university. He went back indoors and turned on the radio, hoping to hear something good from Tokyo about the system that had unwillingly dragged his son into the same pit he chose to enter.\n\n\"And today, Prime Minister Takagi has suggested a repeal to the long-held Mobilization Law to usher in an end to what he calls a 'war long ended, yet still long-fought for'...\""

 jappmtakagi.5.t:0 "The Poison of Corruption"
 jappmtakagi.5.d:0 "Corruption. It is a thing that permeates the fabric and functions of the Japanese nation. As the corruption that Ino Hiroya so foolishly allowed to grow took root in the apparatus of state, it slowly made its way into every other level of society. Not everyone is corrupt, of course, but only the truly ignorant can claim not to know of someone who is. It could be a corporate executive, a general in the army, or a member of the house of representatives. Yet these days, it seems increasingly common that the corrupt one is someone as mundane as a minor bureaucrat or even a salaryman. Even if the problem exists among leaders and the general populace alike, the matter is handled differently among each group.\n\nFor many a general or politician, bribery has become a normal part of any deal they make, having long since thrown away their transparency and commitments. For the average citizen, corruption is something they must contend with at all times. A donation to the right person might allow them to receive a sudden promotion or send their children to a better school. Not all are lucky enough to have the money for such privileges, however.\n\nIn order to end this state of affairs, the Prime Minister has ordered that the corruption be removed from the apparatus of state so that it will no longer seep down through the rest of the nation. In response to this, two plans have been put forward. The first is to embark upon a full scale investigation that will leave no stone unturned and no suspect unquestioned. The other plan is to focus our resources on either a legislative or army investigation, as a more thorough search may provide better results."

Indeed, the change from a small and spartan work station near the IJN anchorage to a large and grandiose office had been dramatic for him. It was most likely simply the passage of time, but the admiral felt that it had more to do with the news he was about to hear. Having finally been given a chance to take on the three-headed monster that was the three great issues that dominated the country, Takagi had found the process to be something of a slog. He could not leave one issue alone for too long, lest it reemerge and undo his progress. Yet it seemed now that his efforts were finally paying off.\n\nSitting at the center of a large table and surrounded by his cabinet, the Prime Minister awaited their usual reports. For once, it seemed as if his ministers were bringing him genuine, untwisted good news. Corruption was beginning to shrink away, the YSK was entering into a seemingly peaceful state, and much of the army's excessive militarization was being successfully curtailed. It was certainly not a tidal wave of upheaval and change, but it was enough to satisfy both Takagi and hopefully his supporters.\n\nAs the meeting came to a close and the ministers began to file out of the room, the Prime Minister requested that Kido Kōichi stay behind. As the former first minister stood at one end of the table, he was still dwarfed by the seated Takagi. \"Kido, you must have been here before. You must have sat in this very room and listened to your ministers tell you of success. But answer this. When was the moment when your efforts to reform caved in around you?\" Kido considered the question before him, not moving for a good while. \"It was sometime after the initial successes. I suppose I found myself feeling more confident than before. Yet I think ultimately that confidence was unfounded. I must admit... the reforms were made too quickly. There was simply no time to consider what my enemies were planning or who was joining their side.\"\n\nTakagi considered what Kido said. \"And what can I hope to learn from this?\"\n\n\"Hiding beneath your banners of victory...\""

Their loud humming and whirring had relegated them to the building's corner as to not disturb the rest of the floor, whose own work required more quiet conditions. Officially, the computers were there to solve mathematical equations and to complete simple organizational tasks. However, Nishioka Tetsuya, a computing researcher, had for a long while been pushing the boundaries of what the computers were truly capable of.\n\n\"Mister Nishioka, I believe you wished to show me something. You mentioned a potential computing innovation?\" The head of Toshiba's research department seemed like an intimidating man to Nishioka, who feared he had heard the promise of miraculous innovation followed by little more than poor excuses for failure. Nor did it help that his superior stood a good foot taller than him, which blotted out the light from the lamp behind him. \"Yes, well I have been conducting some independent research into what our computers could theoretically be used for. You see sir, I was able to create a sort of virtual filing cabinet. It's little more than a set of names and occupations right now, but it seems promising. One of my colleagues thinks he can make one of our devices simulate a stock exchange and I've heard plenty of other promising ideas around the lab too!\" A brief silence ensued, as Nishoka's superior seemed to not only analyse the information he had been given, but the purpose of his employee's occupation. \"Very well Nishioka, I expect to see the computers operating your new systems by the end of the week.\"\n\nWithin a day, most every available researcher was assisting in the computing department. Trails of wires now spewed from the computer room's double doors, keeping them firmly open. A system of monitors had been set up, allowing for numerous personnel to observe the creation of a computerized archive of staff records as well as a simulated stock exchange. The latter innovation had created something of a joke around the lab: \"Whatever you do, buy more Toshiba stock now!\" Indeed, once the company higher ups unveiled their latest products to the market, said joke became something more of a cry on the Tokyo exchange floor."

Tokyo is the heart of not just Japan, but of the Co-Prosperity Sphere too. Naturally, the city attracts people of all kinds, from businessmen and bureaucrats, to labourers and office workers. Although the city continues to grow, most of Tokyo's ward's remain unmodernised. While many cities across Japan have become places made up of concrete and steel, our capital seems to have become almost stuck in the past. Indeed, the core of Tokyo still consists of the buildings, plumbing and crude electrical wiring from a good few decades past. Nostalgia for our humbler past aside, the question of what to do about this dilemma is becoming increasingly pressing.\n\nTo the relief of Tokyo's city planning board, Prime Minister Takagi has embraced the chance to utilize the difficulty. Beyond merely modernizing the city, the Prime Minister believes that this may be a fine opportunity to create a clear symbol of his reforms. Indeed, what could be a finer symbol of the changing times? That the very capital of our nation, is to be rebuilt and massively improved after years of neglect. As Japan moves into the future, Tokyo will be lifted out of the past with it. It will receive all the infrastructure, utilities and grandeur of a modern capital.\n\nPerhaps most significant among these changes, is to be the creation of a new underground train network. The Prime Minister already has several companies interested in operating their own private train lines. This should also help to attract speculators to modernized wards across Tokyo. Within a few years, the city will become a metropolis worthy of the Japanese Empire."

Perhaps because of his success, Takagi decided to let his long-standing advisor in on the discussion at hand.\n\nIn a stately room around a platter of appetizers, Takagi Sōkichi had gathered his attendants and a few representatives from the diet. In a curt speech, he outlined the main issue his government would face- their liberation of the Japanese economic market riled up many representatives who got their seats with hefty donations from the industrialists and military. While some, such as the sanctum of prince Konoe's conservatives would be hard to appeal to, other cliques in the party responded well to the feelers the Prime Minister sent out.\n\n\"And above all else, we have to emphasize that unlike Kido, we are willing to strike a fair deal with potential backers in the Diet.

Now he stood on an unstable mountain, where the wrong steps would see an avalanche suffocate not only the greying admiral, but Osahito and every other ally and cabinet member the Prime Minister used to reach the summit.\n\nTakagi's plan was desperate, almost the opposite of what one would expect from the fast-thinking admiral he was twenty years prior. He would settle for nothing less than to force his plans through the webs of Japanese administration, no matter the cost. Even his closest ministers felt the plan was too reckless. Both Satō and Yasushiro threatened to leave, but the charismatic Takagi sat them back down.\n\n\"The path we are facing will not be made easier by conceding any more than we have and allying with those who but weeks ago wished for our downfall.

The old admiral had his own scores to settle with Kido's wildly unpopular plans, and Kōichi found Sōkichi's policies to cater too much to his pals in the Navy and the keiretsu. Yet the two would need to work together and get still another faction into their growing coalition to secure a majority in the Lower House. The unlikely target was Ikeda's Conservatives, who were not so reactionary that they were all guaranteed to dig themselves into the opposition, but compromises would have to be made.\n\nWhile the two spent the evening figuring out their approaches, the great question remained of Kido's most radical reformists; could Ikeda be brought into the coalition without destroying their own faction and forcing Takagi to search for another ally?

Most of the fading aristocrats sent their estate managers to deliver their records, though a few showed up to personally meet with the lower-level auditors, often with complaints of how Takagi showed no respect for the greatest families of Japan. Even some of the commissioner's own subordinates were buying into their claims of unjust inspection.\n\nThe one who first began to question the legality was a rather plain auditor from Sapporo; his records showed no mention of affiliation with radicals or the Kazoku. He had even threatened to speak with a number of Japanese news agencies about the supposed 'purging' of Japan's old families to provide the Prime Minister with a slush fund. From the perspective of the average citizen, the agitator's case seemed sound.

If he was to clean the whole Co-Prosperity Sphere from the corruption it had bathed in since the East Asian War, Manchukuo would be the ideal starting ground.

Whilst some grew to hate him even more, a significant portion looked to him and smiled, either for his suddenly ornate appreciation of Japanese upper-class pleasures or simply for the money he slipped them. Regardless, Takagi used these tools occasionally to swing enough members under his influence, and it was working quite well.\n\nTakagi scratched the fat cat's belly, and in doing so, he had won the loyalty of a large conservative camp in the National Diet. It was a dirty move, but if it meant they would stop blocking his reforms, it was worth it. No longer having to copy the failed initiatives of the past onto tomorrow's agenda, the efforts to bribe opposition in the Diet had certainly impacted the successes of Takagi's call for reform.

A silence submerged his thoughts in a mist of confusion. How was it so easy? They had abandoned their high and mighty standards for a pretty price, and now they followed the same line of the Prime Minister they used to heckle from the stands as he read it to the crowds.\n\nWith these blocks to Takagi's aims lifted, the Reformists would seemingly roll over to his demands.

Yet before I could even finish reading my own proposal, a series of loud objections were made quite clear to me by a cluster of reformists.

Observing from afar, I noted the jovial nature of the conversation. It appeared that they had beaten me to implementing my own plan. However, just as the conversation broke off, I witnessed the quick transfer of paper money to the objecting reformists. I focused entirely on eating my food for the rest of lunch.\n\nWhen the votes were tallied, it did not surprise me when my proposal was approved by the Diet. While it was a victory, I could not help but feel disgust at its price."

 jappmtakagi.32.d:0 "\"Prime Minister, the accountants have arrived with the documents from the think tanks you wanted them to examine.\" Prime Minister Takagi gestured for the aforementioned accountants to be let in. He had expected perhaps two or three, but as six men entered his office, Takagi was admittedly somewhat confused. Yet as he gazed out of his office window, it became apparent that six accountants would indeed be needed. A second car pulled up at the steps and the driver began to onload a number of large boxes, each one containing documents. \"I suppose those are the financial files we will be looking over,\" inquired the Prime Minister. The accountants replied with a respectful nod.\n\nEventually, the seven or so boxes were delivered to the Prime Minister's office. Their work could begin. Immediately, it became apparent that little effort had been put in properly organizing the documents. Although not directly involved in the process of organizing, Takagi would occasionally request an update on their progress. \"It would appear that the think tanks are trying to make this a challenge for us. We've had to re-organize everything in these boxes.\"\n\n\"Prime Minister, I believe it pertinent that you see this. Once you begin looking at the whole picture, you realise that money simply pours in and out of these think tanks. They've separated their budgets from the sections detailing their funding. Here, you'll see they've accepted money from-\"\n\n\"The military, Diet representatives, and a number of corporations, sir,\" chimed in another accountant. \"They've carefully hidden their real records within these ones. If you give us more time, we should be able to decipher more.\" Not wanting to let the think tanks go unpunished, Takagi agreed to let them take as much time as they needed. \"No wonder they were always trying to contradict me,\" muttered the Prime Minister to himself."

 jappmtakagi.33.d:0 "Prime Minister Takagi had grown accustomed to eating in the Lunchroom of the Imperial Diet building. While the food was much richer than that which he had been served during his time in the navy, Takagi could not say that he found it unpleasant. He had similar feelings about the decor, but unlike the food, the design was not to his taste. Regardless, he ate his meals without complaint and focused mostly on casually observing other members of the diet from the strategic placement of his cabinet minister table. He could now recognise virtually anyone who regularly ate in the lunchroom, whether they were a Representative or a Peer.\n\nIt therefore came as a surprise to him when two men that he had never seen before sat down at the table for cabinet members as if that had been their dining table since birth. They clearly knew each other, as Takagi observed their relaxed and cheery conservation from a few feet away. His gaze did not break from the pair, even as their conversation turned to idle chatter upon starting their meal. Eventually, they noticed the Prime Minister staring at them. Clearly put off by the look they were getting from Takagi, they silently greeted him with a respectful nod and then hastily finished their meal in silence.\n\nThe Prime Minister returned to his office, considering the offensive sight he had witnessed. There was no doubt that they were new members of his cabinet, or they would not have dared to breach decorum by occupying the cabinet table. Yet Takagi had not appointed them to his cabinet. He certainly never would, based on their behaviour in the lunchroom. No, someone else had selected these two for cabinet positions without informing him. While he intended to eventually discover the perpetrator, the Prime Minister was in truth more concerned with finding an excuse to get rid of his unwanted subordinates. Once he had replaced them with suitable choices, the message would be quite clear enough."

Teruya Kenichi was unfortunately engrossed in a thrilling documentary about Japanese wildlife, and ignored Teruo. \"Kenichi, this is genuinely important. The Prime Minister has just announced that several think tanks have been taking money from generals and corporations!\" Kenichi dismissed his older brother's concern as another overreaction to what had probably been an open secret for ages. Taken slightly aback that his younger brother had once again dismissed the news, Teruo restated that it only once again proved that the Prime Minister was truly committed to reform. This had not been the first time he had exposed high-level corruption, after all. \"Why else would he so publically share something that affects even the most secretive parts of our society?\" Clearly annoyed by his brother's insistence, Kenichi finally turned to look at Teruo. \"All you've done since graduating from university is sit at home and read the papers. There's a whole world out there! Go out and find a job!\"\n\nSensing his cause was quite lost, Teruo returned to his newspaper. He probably did need a job. It would certainly take his mind off things. The job listings proved quite boring and disheartening until he came upon the last thing he could have possibly expected. One of the think tanks was searching for a junior economist. \"It looks like that degree might finally pay off, huh?\" The older brother tossed the paper towards his sibling, who proceeded to pick it up after it narrowly missed the TV. \"Well Teruo, if you want to find out if those think tanks are bad as the Prime Minister says they are, now's your chance.\""

 jappmtakagi.35.t:0 "A Shift Within Japanese Democracy"
 jappmtakagi.35.d:0 "Elections were an inconsistent matter in the Empire of Japan. Up until recently, they had not been held at regular intervals, instead occurring entirely upon the whims of the government. The results of the vote were often dubious too, although the level of interference was ultimately decided by the Prime Minister and the wider Taisei Yokusankai. Usually this took the form of intimidating independent candidates or making last minute changes to polling stations and minor electoral regulations. Prime Minister Takagi had, until recently, largely focused his attention on other matters, but now a report had arrived on his desk. It seemed he would have to consider the future of the Japanese electoral process.\n\nThe report outlined possible ways that a potential future election could be rigged in favour of the government. It would work, there was no question about that in Takagi's mind. However, as the public was more than aware of previous electoral fraud, Takagi would certainly suffer a blow to his standing with the populace. Realising that he could not possibly make a decision on whether to commit to the plan now, the Prime Minister dismissed the advisors in his office and bade them return in the afternoon.\n\nIn truth, losing face with the public was not something Takagi wished to deal with. He had worked hard to earn the trust of a population that had grown tired by years of negligent governments and army obstruction. Yet this downside was in many ways a tactical loss, rather than a strategic one. If Takagi increased his strength in the Imperial Diet, then he would be far more capable of implementing his own reforms. Many of said reforms would go a long way in improving the lives of Japanese people. Prime Minister Takagi was now sure of his choice. He would guarantee that the election produced a grand victory, and then do all that was in his power to make sure he did not waste such a golden opportunity."

 jappmtakagi.36.d:0 "The school trip into central Tokyo had been amazing so far. Kawane Ryo had visited the capital once before. This time, he was old enough to truly appreciate the sights around him. It certainly beat his quiet village by a wide margin, he thought. During the hour-long bus ride, the classes' teacher Kagawa-san had taken the opportunity to go into greater detail about what their trip was about. The government had begun a new initiative to promote an interest in politics in the younger generations. Part of this involved taking a few classes to visit the Imperial Diet Building, where they would get to witness politics in action. Kagawa-san was careful to remind her students they were to be exceptionally well-behaved in the Diet Building, as it was in that place that their future was being decided. Ryo vowed to remember that.\n\nTo the disappointment of the class, they were not let in through the grand front entrance of the National Diet building. Instead, they entered through a side door and had their bags searched. With that done, the children were finally allowed into the building proper, where they were greeted by a Mihara-San, who was to be their guide. Ryo listened diligently to Mihara-San's descriptions of the Diet's many rooms and their functions, but it was the stunning architecture that truly captured his attention. The central hall, with its ornately carved walls and arches, landscape paintings and shining glasswork stuck with Ryo the most. Mihara-San did a good job of capturing the class's attention, so when he announced that they would now be attending a session of the Diet, many of them were quite excited. The House of Representatives' chamber was equally as impressive as the entrance hall, with the added benefit of comfortable seating. As the grand chamber filled with the representatives of the Diet, Ryo was eager to hear what they would be discussing. As it turned out, the meeting of the Diet was in fact rather dull. For an entire half hour, they discussed little more than budget deficits.\n\nWhen Kawane Ryo returned home, his parents were eager to hear about his school visit to the Imperial Diet. \"I had fun,\" was his simple but truthful response."

 jappmtakagi.37.t:0 "Auditing the Independents"
 jappmtakagi.37.d:0 "\"Shall we proceed with the list, sir?\" Takagi's assistant offered the Prime Minister the first of many files that had been stacked high on his desk. These were audits that had been conducted on each and every independent in the House of Representatives. The audits had yielded plenty of evidence against certain independents, but it was ultimately up to Takagi to decide what would become of them. The first file pertained to a man he recognised. He had been a promising naval officer, whose career had been cut short by a sudden desire to play politics. Takagi considered him a good friend, even if they did have their disagreements on policy. \"I needn't say that it would be stupid to exectute and imprison every independent. I think I'll select a few of them at random. That should produce the desired effect.\"\n\nTakagi continued his examination of the audits. He came across a few more friends, some of whom had crossed the line on a few occasions. Regardless, The Prime Minister quickly placed them into the pile of those that would be spared. Most of the other Independents were not men he knew especially well, little more than nuisances in his mind. Sending a few of them to prison would lose the Prime Minister no sleep. Some of the audits had produced little in the way of evidence, while others contained solid proof of treason. Either way, Takagi selected them at random with an efficient pace.\n\nIt was only when he read the file of another one of his friends that he paused. He was another naval officer, although his career had been much longer. He turned to politics after retiring from the Navy. As an independent his focus has been on local politics for his small rural community in Yamagata. Yet it appeared that he had made some deals with foreign companies, and used his connections in the navy to smuggle them Japanese goods. Takagi was deeply distrubed by the actions of his trusted friend. He all but dropped the file into the pile of the guilty, before reconsidering and placing it in the opposite stack. \"He'll learn his lesson\", the Prime Minister thought to himself."

 jappmtakagi.38.d:0 "Takagi sat alone in his office. All but the essential staff at the Imperial Diet had gone home for the day, which had turned the usually bustling and noisy halls rather more quiet. It was this time of day that the Prime Minister used to reflect upon current events, as well as his own recent actions and decisions. He could not deny that he had made good progress in terms of implementing democratic reforms.\n\nThe school tours of the Imperial Diet had proved successful; More young people than ever had expressed interest in joining the YSK, and many more were eager to vote in the next election. The best result had perhaps been the increased support for the government among the youth. There had been successes in other areas too. The independents had recently proven more agreeable in the Diet, ever since their numbers were slightly thinned through the auditing process. Even more corruption, Takagi's ever-present enemy, had been purged through a recent examination of the Think-Tanks. Not only had this yet again weakened bribery and subversion, but it had markedly improved the effectiveness of the Think-Tanks themselves. For the first time in a while, they were actually doing their jobs.\n\nProgress had been swift and certainly efficient. Still, this left the Prime Minister with a single linger question: \"Has too much been done, in too little time?\" This was not the first time Takagi had feared that his reforms had been rushed through without enough thought given to long term consequences. He reminded himself this was the inevitable effect of hindsight. The dice had been cast in his favour, now all Takagi could do was plan his next turns carefully. Precise and steady reform was necessary, but nothing would truly get his enemies off his back. The Ship had set sail long ago and the Captain was now bound to sail it safely into port."

Based on information gathered with his cabinet, the Prime Minister had requested a survey of all major Japanese ports in search of misappropriated funds, resources, and labor. The investigations went through mostly unchallenged in major dockyards but often faced the scowls and sneers of officers made uncomfortable with the poking and prodding of anti-corruption officials.\n\nSome cabinet members were quick to point out that the Prime Minister, himself of a naval background in the IJN, may impede the successes of the investigations by covering up details on account of his history as a naval officer. Outraged by the infidelity of his own ministers, Takagi lashed back in a tense dispute - eventually coming to an agreement that his domestic minister, Horikiri Zenjiro, should be delegated the authority to carry out the inquiry across the country."

They shook hands and sat opposite to each other whilst discussing Tadashi's findings; the Prime Minister was fascinated by the responsibilities of the military in defense and administration across Asia. Also being presented with Ino's 1962 report on the economic affairs of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Takagi drew his attention to the great costs of this military bureaucracy.\n\nIn truth, the Armed Forces' role across Asia was bloated and inefficiently organized. They racked up billions of Yen each year, and often found themselves inadequately trained or running particularly repressive administrations over civilian populations. The Prime Minister, now aware of the great burden to reform the colonial responsibilities of the empire, closed the report and leaned back in his chair and let out a deep breath - preparing himself for the great task at hand."

 jappmtakagi.42.d:0 "Takagi, alone in his office, flicked through the section of Tadashi's report that detailed the IJA presence in Choson and Taiwan. Overall, military involvement in the governance of Taiwan was the most tame; as the 'model colony' acquired in the Japan-Qing War, the people of Taiwan had grown accustomed to and comfortable with IJA presence across the island. The island was vastly underdeveloped, however, and was in desperate need of modernizing. However, cooperation between natives, Japanese settlers, and the IJA formed a uniquely constructive community in Taiwan - striking a pleasing balance for the Prime Minister.\n\nChoson was a different story, however. Repeated abuses of the native population by the IJA had been reported by civilian organizations as they used slave labor in military administration. Things were particularly brutal in the north of the peninsula, where local populations were regularly worked for the benefit and sometimes entertainment of corrupt and irresponsible military officials. The Prime Minister was aware of the particularly gluttonous governance of southern Choson, particularly in major cities, but news of the abuses in the north and rural regions revolted him."

 jappmtakagi.43.t:0 "The Colonial Situation - SEA"
 jappmtakagi.43.d:0 "Sifting further through Tadashi's dossier, Takagi read of the military presence in Southeast Asia. Garrisons were freckled throughout the region, undertaking patrols throughout the dense jungles and rambling cities of the region. Indeed, the nations of Southeast Asia had largely been deferential towards the Empire of Japan.\n\nWhat was to be noted was how unnecessary the presence of thousands of troops in single regions were to the integrity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Not only did this burden Tokyo with sky-high costs in growing military budgets, but the overbearing residence of our troops agitated the local populations and often proliferated anti-Japanese sentiment. Where the power really rested, however, was in the IJN that dominated the South China Sea and Indonesian Archipelago, influencing the affairs of collaborationist governments through corrupt dealings and threats of bombardment. Takagi rubbed his eyes and scribbled down the notes of his findings as he read on, hoping to come up with a conclusive argument for colonial reform in the region."

He certainly approved of military administrations across the region, maintaining a firm paternalism over the affairs of the Chinese. However, reading reports detailing IJA abuses in rural regions, the Takagi was troubled more by the accounts of massacres, weapons tests, and other atrocities committed against the local populace.\n\nThis was too common among the undisciplined troops in China, Takagi thought, it was bad for the civilian interaction with their Japanese benefactors. He scoffed; what bastard thought that slave labor, random acts of killing, and the rapes of entire households of women would increase their opinion of us? So, after spending some time massaging his temples, Takagi took the time to begin piecing together notes and ideas on how to end the juvenile negligence of duty in the Chinese regions, and make the IJA a force worthy of fear and respect. After all, if the Japanese were to maintain their rule in China, they would have to do it well."

Skimming over the paragraphs explaining statistics and operations, it was clear to the Prime Minister that the IJA largely relied on the collaborator government in defending the region.\n\nThe military of the Azad Hind government was large enough to defend much of its territories, only requesting Japanese support in strategic and intelligence operations. Indeed, with IJA advisors as comfortable friends as well as allies with officials in Calcutta, the region was not nearly dominated by the military affairs of the empire. Takagi came to the conclusive paragraph, nodding and informed, noting the contingency of the numbers of Japanese forces within Indian territories in the withdrawals that he may request."

The Prime Minister and his cabinet had spent hours of their time sifting through statistics, reports, and graphs, and this was their moment to present a conclusive declaration of the government's actions towards corruption and misappropriation throughout the military.\n\nAfter finalizing his government's opinions on the report, Takagi announced that cuts to the IJA were going to be made across the Co-Prosperity Sphere, withdrawing military personnel and tightening the budget. Many advisors with ties to the armed forces gasped and grumbled, and Takagi raised his voice to quell the ambiguities and outrage among his small audience.

But, ultimately, flooding the home islands with troops who have nothing to do is only going to go bad for him.

It is the old men who act as dripping manifestations of social inertia across the political battlefields of the nation. It is only right that, with time, the political establishment must wipe away vestiges of bygone eras. Or, at least, that is what Takagi thought as he ordered his allies and followers to cut ties with, or even ostracize, the old men of the Tōseiha, an informal web of political alliances dating back to the 20s. And, after a few weeks of silence, Takagi sat back with relief at the success of the operation. There would be no battle, it would seem, over letting sick dogs loose.\n\nThat would be until, the next morning, a letter appeared on top of the stack of papers he was to read through and sign. Opening it with deliberation, Takagi read the words on top; \"A warning, for the Prime Minister's eyes.\" Pulling out the letter from the envelope, Takagi anxiously glanced over the paragraphs contained within. The letter detailed a plan, abound with blackmail and scandal, which would bring about the downfall of the Takagi government if the old men were not welcomed, with open arms, back into both the Tōseiha and the administration. Apparently, from what the letter said, nearly the entire government bureaucracy was waiting for the right moment to overthrow Takagi, and his ever-despised reforms.\n\nThe day, then forward, moved at a distorted pace. At every mark of his pen, at every sentence read, Takagi could not help but survey his environment. A secretary pushing a cart down a hallway. The clock ticking, and ticking, and ticking again. Once his cabinet, at last, came to meet with him, he wrangled them into a spare closet. Each of them, after looking over the letter, laughed it off. After closer inspection, it was discovered that several titles and names were misspelled, the letter's plans didn't really make sense, and its claims were far too grandiose. At the behest of his advisers, Takagi threw the letter in the trash, and moved on with the day. It could only be a bluff... right?"

Takagi settled his arms uncomfortably within its bounds, the hard back of the chair already taking its toll on his spine. The throne of the Emperor, colorful in its design and of a heavenly, regal craft, sat empty a few feet behind the seat of the Prime Minister. The last time he had been in the House of Peers, years and years ago, he had only sat in the observer's balcony. He couldn't remember much, only that he held a distaste for these men of privilege who took it upon themselves to abuse the positions and promises of their forefathers.\n\nOnce the crowd settled down, and the aides began motioning him to begin, he sat up, his pre-prepared speech in his hands. Takagi read, \"it is my formal duty, as the Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan, to announce this opening of the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet.

Budget, infrastructure, anti-corruption measures, it doesn't matter what the bill contains, it won't change the result. So, you got a bill you wanna pass, but no one else does. You see, our ever-humble public servants have found it to be most profitable to sell their votes. What you and I know as 'government' is, in reality, an auction building. Our tax dollars flow up and into the blender of the Diet, to be distributed to whichever politician's vote is most important. You don't have to be rich to play the game, to dance that fandango just use your second bank account, otherwise known as the 'treasury'. Once your allies are salted with cash, time to move onto the hardballs. To get those bastards on board, whip out the pork barrel, and start funneling cash into their hands for 'administrative purposes'. Alright, you still don't have the votes, time to do some favors. A fishing regulation here, an unbanning of underground bureaucratic channels there, whatever needs to be shoved into the bill to get it to pass. Keep ramming it in, and nothing can go wro- was that the flash of a camera I heard? Uh-oh, the press is on your tail, time to start flooding all the media channels you know with cash and hoping they don't release evidence of your corruption. But... if they do release the evidence, just claim that you and your cronies deserve the extra money for your hard and dedicated efforts in improving the nation. The bill is on the Diet floor now, and sure to pass. By the way, what was this bill about again? Who cares. Your job as an administrator has been fulfilled. Now, let us move onto the House of Peers...\"\n\nTakagi grimaced as he read over the satirical comic. It was an underground publication, backed by American money. Even so, large parts of it rung true. Corruption was an ever-present spectre in legislative matters. No matter how much Takagi didn't want to be involved, he was forced to \"dance that fandango,\" as the comic stated, in order to be anything more than a figurehead Prime Minister."

This institution, the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, served as his home and learning environment for several years. The paint was wearing, the stones eroding, and the roof tiles breaking off. It was a monument to a simple, idealistic past which, in reality, never existed. Walking through its front doors, Takagi was sent on a nostalgia trip. A young man, who believed that he could transform the IJN from the inside, who would go on to see his innocence and naivety ripped from him in the fire and blood of empire.\n\nIt was in those classrooms that he was taught absolute discipline and the strategies of naval warfare. He remembered the long-dead teachers who saw to it that he would grow up to be an honorable servant of the Emperor. It was in those cafeterias that he ate salted rice for years on end to train his instinctual desires. Looking over the walls, he spotted photos of his class, fifty years ago. Young men, old friends, smiling towards the future. Some died in the East Asia War. Most drifted apart. This was a somber place, more so than he remembered.\n\nWhile examining a model of the battleship Yamato, Takagi noticed a figure in the empty halls of the academy. A janitor, mopping the floors. Looking him over, seeing his slow, cyclic movements, Takagi felt a strange sensation. This man, whoever he was, reminded him of his younger self, but a younger self that could never feel the glory of the Empire nor the hope of social mobility. This man could have been the next great admiral or at least a dedicated sailor. Instead, this janitor, who looks to be in his 30s, has had his life ended right here, in these halls.\n\nTakagi walked out, his head down, as dedicated as he was those fifty years ago. Educational opportunities would be expanded, and he would make sure his cabinet saw it through. No more languishing. He had the power, and it was time to do what he could only wish for as a young man."

The youth of today were born in the Emperor's victory, a time of unique peace and prosperity, but they knew war just like any generation before.\n\nMilitarism had entrenched itself into society during the Great East Asian War, and its warring culture had now coalesced around the youth. IJA and IJN recruitment is rife in universities, well-established in libraries, and praised by the government itself. With a cemented, undying devotion to defending East Asia, propping up their fathers' military conquests had developed a pride in these young men that only violence could satiate.\n\nWith Japan's rising affluence in the twentieth century, urbanisation had risen as populations flocked into cities. Travelling from rural communities, many young people had come in search of wealth, employment, or a new start. The mingling of these varied forms of language, mannerisms, and personal philosophies created a distinctively eccentric class of urbanites loyal to the Imperial throne.\n\nHowever, it has been observed that groups in universities, theatres, and youth organisations have developed an odd affinity for American culture. Smuggled literature is distributed in secret, jazz music has seen a resurgence along with popular American tunes, and some have even begun to cut their hair in American styles and use American words.\n\nThe youth of Tokyo have come to represent the most idiosyncratic aspects of the fringes of Japanese society, but as absurd as the youth seems, they remain committed to the Emperor, and to Japan."

Akito expressed his anger that there was no more space left for fishermen like him, as the great ships would crush his vessel without even noticing. Eizo was silent, and then grunted in agreement; he insisted that it was a great shame that the nation had forgotten its history of small fishing communities. Both of the old men sipped their teas and continued to watch the great stretches of the Pacific waters, occasionally pointing at a bird or another freighter ship charging into the bay.\n\nThey didn't bother bringing any fishing equipment with them, as their cynicism had already judged the government had replaced any desire to support fishing communities with the profits of offshore fishing operations and using the ports for shipping. In fact, these men were far too old to even climb down to the harbor to fish. They had no choice but to watch the buoys dance in the distant waters and listen to the gusts of ocean winds as prisoners of their old age.

Although somewhat cramped by the belongings of the mother, father and their three children, one could not say that they lived uncomfortably. It was a cozy home, filled with joy. They had been lucky to even get the apartment, but with their small corner shop proving fruitful, the Okuma's just about pulled it off. However their good fortune did not last. Each month, they had to perform a careful balancing act of maintaining growth and paying off debts.\n\nWhile they managed their finances for a while without fail, the opening of a much larger store just a few streets down spelled certain doom for their corner shop. Eventually, the time came to explain the coming changes to the children.\n\nThe Okuma's gathered around the dinner table, eating a meal that was much smaller than they had grown accustomed to. The father could not even look up from his plate as he spoke.\n\n\"I'm sure you've noticed that your mom and dad have been a bit anxious recently. We haven't been going to work as much and I'm aware you've seen us looking a bit worried when you come home from school. There's a bit less money going around these days and it's getting harder to scrape by.\"\n\nThe father took the hands of his children and looked them in the eye, trying to look hopeful. The mother chimed in, to take the pressure of her husband. She took a candle out of a small box and handed it to her eldest child.\n\n\"We're going to need all three of you to be really strong, okay? When it gets dark, we need to use these now. It'll be cosy and if you get scared, you can sleep in our room.\" Seeing the tears in the eyes of her husband she knew she would also have to tell her children the hardest part.\n\n\"And on the weekends, you're going to have to make do without food. It's not fair, I know. It's going to be so tough, but I know how strong you all are. You're going to be so brave. We promise this won't be like this forever, we really do. We'll find a way to make even more money than before, and then you can eat whatever you like.\"\n\nEventually, she broke down as well. The children, still too young to truly realise their situation began to suggest that they could work too, or maybe sell some of their toys and clothes. The future seemed terrifying to the Okuma parents, but the naive optimism of their children gave them some hope. For them, the mother and father would do anything."

He used to love running down the stairs, grabbing the letters and getting back home as fast as he could. These days, he was far too hungry. His stomach hurt as he trudged into the lobby, his eyes barely leaving the floor. The child absently searched the mailbox, and eventually picked out the single letter found within. The writing on the front mentioned something about a ministry, but the Okuma child was too tired to read it properly. Instead, he headed back up the stairs and placed the letter on the table in the kitchen. The boy's father, who's eyes were red from too little sleep and too much crying, dared not flip the envelope when he first saw it, lest it be revealed as another bill. Eventually he gained enough courage to dispel those thoughts, which revealed \"Ministry of Finance\" on the front of the letter. Curiosity and a spark of hope caused the father to tear upon the envelope without a moment of consideration.\n\n\"To Okuma Taro and Chinatsu. You are receiving this letter due to your employment as business owners as well as the difficult situation that you find yourselves in. The government has recently implemented measures aimed at aiding businesses such as yours. Therefore, the ministry of finance has examined your financial situation and decided to subsidize your business. You will soon be receiving a cheque, valued at-\"\n\nAs soon as Mr Okuma saw the amount, he called for his wife and children to read the letter too, to make sure that he had not made a mistake.\n\nThe subsidies turned out to be just what the Okuma's needed to save the corner shop. They would no longer have to fear bankruptcy and poverty. Even so, they still were forced to make a difficult choice. The business would not survive in the city, no matter how much support it received. As such, the Okuma's decided to move back to the country, where they would at least be able to live comfortably. As they left their apartment for the last time, the Okuma's hoped that they were not the only ones to have been so lucky."

As she brought over the wooden bowl of seafood to her husband, she peered down to see the boy's work and gasped - numbers! Small columns and tables were sprawled across the boy's sheets of paper as he used the pennies to count, with answers to simple problems scribbled in pencil lead beneath symbols of multiplication and division. She called over her husband, who in turn hurried over to examine the papers and observe his son.\n\nHe flicked through the papers; each creased sheet reading 'Science' or 'Mathematics', reading with basic problems or chemical formulas with diagrams printed onto them.

The students had only wanted a few reforms, most of all the repeal of the Kokumin Yuseiho, which continued to see through that supposed 'inferiors' were murdered or sterilized. Takagi's bandaid remedy to the deaths of innocents was not, in retrospect, a gentle way to approach the issue. Sure, a committee was formed to question the legality of the Kokumin Yuseiho, but it did nothing and continued to do nothing. Katō wrote a scathing op-ed in all mainstream newspapers, who were all too happy to accept the circulation of their papers for free. It was on everyone's minds: the youth movement was ever more enraged, and Takagi could not continue to prevent the march of social progress.\n\n\"Takagi Sōkichi claims to be the leader of the reformist faction of the Yokusankai, and yet his actions are painted with the colors of blind reaction and the blood of the honorable.

He was, too, a student with radical dreams once. He thought he could transform the navy from the inside into a liberalized, less militaristic organization. He had succeeded, but these children had not. Frustrated by an oppressive system, they rebelled. They lost, of course, in the most tragic of ways. Takagi shed a few tears as he looked over their cobblestone plaques. The fog and humid mist of the horizon was all that would welcome his sadness.\n\nA few camera flashes and forlorn questions thrown pitifully against his back greeted his return to the reality of Japan and its politics. Some straggler journalists had followed him here, so it seemed. Even in the abyss of the mind, he could not attain privacy. Takagi turned to the journalists, prepared to make an announcement.\n\n\"To all of those who may be listening in, I would like to make a promise.

Takagi smirked, skeptical of Katō's sanity, and continued flicking through the article's claims. He came across phrases such as 'treasonous against the freedom of humanity' and 'a misogyny amplified to imperial standards', and chuckled harder at the outrageousness of their claims.\n\nAfter reading some of the terms to Kido, the Prime Minister found Katō's section on the recent student protests. She remained ambiguous over her support of the student protests, but noted that the more Takagi's police used violence, the more violent the students would grow. Takagi, lost for words, read this over many times. The students grew louder and louder each day, motivated by their resistance against law enforcement. He had already thought it, already seen it.

Law enforcement redirected the masses of people, but the Prime Minister knew they'd eventually reach his building.

Who knows what they will do if we let their grubby hands near our legislature. Look outside - it's treason!\"\n\nTakagi glanced at the irritated man before returning his vision to the thin air. He was still and silent, but sweating profusely. The faint roar of the protests grew louder and louder as the march continued, with law enforcement regrouping closer to the cabinet's office. Behind them, they had left destruction in their path, litter across the streets and windows smashed near outbreaks of violence. Clashes with law enforcement became more frequent, now visible from the windows of Takagi's offices. He peered from behind a curtain and turned back to his cabinet, all eager to hear his next move.

You are a politician, and you've lived and worked in the heart of politics in Japan for longer than I have. It seems that I am being dragged into that heart more and more these days. I am sure you have seen and heard much of the student movement that has taken the streets these past few months. I am so very happy to see young people here stand up for themselves and fight back. Such a movement for genuine reform has been long coming in this country. I cannot say I agree with all their demands, but I suppose I am somewhat older than them! I hope this does not undermine their hard work, as I fear the older generations will not be so radical as they are... My public support for these students has had some unexpected consequences. It seems that I have ended up becoming some of a figurehead for this movement, despite my hesitations. While it has been good to provide them with this support, I must say the attention from the political establishment is becoming uncomfortable.\n\nThe Prime Minister has recently expressed interest in meeting with me and I am deeply unsure as to what I must do. He speaks of negotiation and compromise, but I wonder if that is truly what he, or those he represents wants. Agreeing to meet with him, even if it does illicit a workable compromise, might push me further into the limelight. I don't want to suffer through another arrest like I did all those years ago.\n\nAs you can see, I need your aid. You know how to deal with politicians and bureaucrats, you've stood against the YSK for years and called for reforms all the while. What do you do in situations like this? I hope you are well and that this letter does not cause you too much bother\n\nMy Deepest Thanks,\n\nShidzue."

 japtakagirecon.62.d:0 "It has been over thirty years since the implementation of the now deeply controversial Kukumin Yuseiho. Since then, it has been used to suppress the rights of women, while masking itself in a guise of protecting the population from genetic disease. Failure on the part of the government to address this long-standing issue has caused numerous problems over the decades. While Prime Minister Takagi has recently opened a commission to \"re-examine\" the kokumin yuseiho, it is doubtful that much will change through this process. What is clear, is that the youth of this country are no longer willing to sit by and allow their future to be decided by the older generations. Can we really blame them for protesting the government's sluggish response to the changing times? I do not think so. When a piece of legislation affects around half the population's rights to their own bodies, is it truly so unreasonable that many young people in Japan today wish to see the kokumin Yuseiho go?\n\nIt is narrow-minded to view the student protests as merely a spark of rebelliousness. I believe they demonstrate the will and demands of a much larger section of the population that has been too suppressed, both politically and socially, to speak up prior to now. These are laws that affect the fundamental rights of women and they stand in the face of progress and equality. The activism of the youth in the face of government stubbornness should be seen as an inspiration and a bright hope of future reforms towards a more equal society. The Kokumin Yuseiho must now be repealed and replaced with something more fitting with the times we live in. It is my hope that the student's hard work can demonstrate this to the government."

He extended his arm out to greet her, to which she bowed her head and looked away. Kido, foreseeing the awkward tension of the meeting, took a deep breath and began to get comfortable.\n\nHe wiggled in his chair momentarily, before resting his arms on the table and speaking to Katō: \"I knew Ishimoto Keikichi. A good man; he really stood up for what he believed in. Saying that, we could never agree.. He would always be adamant in bringing up issues no one else cared about. I respect his firm loyalty to such a cause. He must've been a hell of a husba-\"\n\n\"Do you respect my firm loyalty to a cause, Mr. Kido? Are we not here to discuss matters far more important than private affairs?\"\n\nKido sat in awe, stunned by Katō's interruption. She was a difficult and unwieldy force to be reckoned with, he noted, and could not help but be intrigued by her passions for such an absurd cause. Nonetheless, he had a duty to piece together what she stood for, and understand her role in the recent chaos spreading throughout Japan's cities. Putting the clipboard to the side and crossing one leg over the other, Kido began to question Katō on her political positions and theory. He was seized by her theses, creating great mental notes on her postulations over the state of modern Japan. Kido nodded and smiled - he couldn't get enough of her bullshit."

She was firm and her position was immovable; she held her chin up and looked down upon the pampered Mr. Kido. They had been discussing her feminist theory for over an hour now, and Kido listened casually whilst scribbling notes. He sat across from her and watched from behind his clipboard, recording key pieces of information to be passed on in a later report, though at moments he found himself doodling during her over-scrupulous ranting.\n\nEventually, she had finished speaking and Kido saw his chance; referring to his notes, he glanced back up at her and prodded her with loaded questions: \n\"I appreciate your passion, Miss Katō. I do ask, if I may, what grand solution to wipe away the 'Patriarchal Dictatorship' would repealing a single law be? Do you speak out for a second about the sterilisation clause? For a woman of modern academia, you have left a lot unclear.\"\n\nKido had a despicably smug look across his face. He had caught Katō out, and she was red-faced and furious.

Gradually, Kido prodded Katō to ask about her stance on the sterilization clause of the Kokumin Yuseiho, to which she cleared her throat and blinked a few times in astonishment. Kido chuckled, insisting he was curious as she did not relieve him with an answer in their last interaction. Comforted by the tranquil and serene environment, she began to disclose her thoughts to the well-dressed and cunning Mr. Kido:\n\n\"In truth, my opinion... well I have no opinion. I have no problem with the sterilization clause. I have not come into any friction with it, and I don't understand how anyone would, frankly.\"\n\nKido's eyes lit up like stars as he nodded, maintaining his facade of genuine interest to keep her talking. Nudging his fingers across the underside of the table to check the bugging device was still recording, Kido broke into a firm smile that seemed to approve of Katō's stance. She explained herself, and every word he treated as a gift. She mentioned, somewhat reluctantly, that if the student's found out about this opinion she would be treated as an outcast and as an enemy. Kido's smile spread across his face, delighted her confessions were being recorded on tape, and his amiable expressions urged her to divulge further.

Kido, briefing Takagi with any and all information he needed to know about Katō, spoke for a long while, dashing between anecdotes and figures to help him make sense of the operation.\n\nTakagi stood up from his seat, still listening to Kido, and reached for a couple of luxury, expansive glasses from behind a cabinet. He poured a small amount of his finest champagne for himself and his colleague as Kido began to announce his news of the tapes. Thoroughly impressed, Takagi could not be more happy with the lengths Kido had gone to to gather the evidence required to keep Katō under his finger. They raised their glasses, and sipped from the wine with a great sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe Prime Minister fell back into his chair and exhaled a sigh of relief. Nodding his head in approval, he noted to Kido that he thought Katō was an idiot, but a useful one that had potential to be the unraveling of the student movement.

While he had no chance of winning them all over, there were some that could be convinced through flattery and conversation. As such, Kido had gathered his chosen candidates for lunch.\n\n\"Esteemed gentlemen, I am honored that you have all accepted my invitation to lunch.\"\n\n\"We could hardly refuse when you take us to lunch here, Kido.\" This comment was met with polite chuckles from Kido and the rest of the nobles around the table. \"I hope whatever business you wish to discuss will not ruin this meal.

Yet, I do ask that you hear me out, The Prime Minister has agreed to implement some of Katō's reforms and he requires your support to succeed. I understand that you are far from keen to see Katō get her way, but this a matter of saving the nation from disaster in the long-term. These small reforms will pacify the student protests and restore order to the streets. Besides, most of the changes will go unnoticed by most people. They are mostly symbolic gestures that will ultimately protect national polity.\"\n\nIt would have been incorrect to describe the assembled Kazoku as convinced. Kido could tell that he had not entirely won them over, but planted the seeds of consideration in heads. Stressing the issue would not do any good.\n\n\"I do not need to hear a yes or no right now, gentlemen. Please consider what I said in your own time.

He is planning to move forward with these reforms and put them to a vote in the Imperial Diet. However, it's not clear how much support Takagi has for this.

At times like this, you're going to have to put away your distaste for the Prime Minister to achieve something good.\"\n\nIshimoto remained silent for a good few seconds, but expression changed to that of reluctant acceptance. \"Fine, I'll see what strings I can pull for you.

The Prime Minister and his supporters were less than enthused. Finally, Kishi stood up from his seat among the rows of representatives.\n\n\"From its inception, I have been an opponent of this government. The ideological direction of the Prime Minister has swayed Japan off course and led us down into a shameful state. I had expected as much from this government, but I had not expected them to now stoop even lower.

This government will surrender the moral fabric of the nation under the guise of being diplomats and populists. Talks of reforming laws such as the Kokumin Yuseiho violate the Kokutai itself! This, of course, begs the question of how far this government is prepared to tear Japan apart. Will the Kokutai soon be examined by a commission? Will the Taisei Yokusankai be forcefully disbanded? I dread to think what will happen if the Prime Minister is not stopped. Those men in this room who still have your dignity, your morals and your conscience, I ask of you to vote against any proposed reform to the Kokumin Yuseiho.

He was a conservative, and he stood against such sweeping reform. However, with such a precarious and uncertain political climate, Ikeda relied on stability, even if it came from this Prime Minister. After what felt like hours of tense reasoning, Takagi felt like Ikeda was on a knife's edge; with a bit of bartering, he could be convinced. The old man was wary of even mentioning any attempt to repeal the Konoe-era law, and sighed out of frustration - despite everything, Takagi's plan was the safest option for the stability of the nation.\n\n\"It's hardly religion, Ikeda. It's our last chance - there's no saying the Taisei Yokusankai will survive if we don't pass this through. The old law will go, but a new one will fall in its place. You have my word, the protections will stay in place.\"\n\nIkeda slowly shut his eyes. He bit his lip and slowly nodded, his hands sinking to his sides as he visibly began to concede to the Prime Minister. Takagi approached him with a smile and patted him on the back, thanking him for his support.

The three men sat around the Prime Minister's table, and Takagi began by explaining what he had managed throughout the day.\n\nThe Prime Minister had focused on his connections among the navy, hoping to limit their involvement in the matter or even get them to support him. Takagi had also worked to shore up the reformist clique in the diet, to ensure that none of them had any sudden ideas about how to vote. While the Prime Minister was not calling upon the largest pool of support, he was undeniably bringing in old allies that had always been fairly reliable. Takagi was therefore grateful for Horikiri and Kido, who had contacts of their own to call upon.\n\nAs expected, Deputy Prime Minister Kido had contacted numerous members of the House of Peers as well as a few officials in the Imperial Household. Meanwhile, Horikiri had spent his time hunting down potential allies in the House of Representatives.\n\nAll of this they told the Prime Minister, who, while clearly listening, was locked in deep consideration. Before ending the meeting for the night, Takagi summarized his feelings on the matter.\n\n\"Even with all the allies we have gathered, the favors we have called in, and whatever other methods we have deployed, it is not yet clear whether we can be sure of victory.

His elucidations were clothed in a unique pragmatism; he was aware of the traditions and duties he had to uphold as Prime Minister but also conscious of the increasingly popular demands of the students who stood to protest in the streets again. Takagi stood tall and firm, yet his words sailed over the heads of many sitting in the hall.\n\nIt became more and more obvious towards the conclusion of the Prime Minister's speech that the Diet was split. Independents and Kidoites nodded and applauded the motions of Prime Minister Takagi, hailing him as a wise and pragmatic mediator. The same could not be said for the technocrats and many of the conservatives that filled the Diet's seats, as they shook their heads and audibly protested the speech with low groans and mumbles. An empty applause sounded throughout the great hall. From his podium, even with the supportive grins of allies in the Diet, it was clear that many would not even consider supporting him after voicing his intention to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho.

Takagi was beyond arguing with her as they had for months now, and simply snapped at her that the Diet was not cooperating with any attempt to revoke the law. He spoke down to her, scowling that the necessity to appeal to conservatives and independents in the Taisei Yokusankai was their only hope to gain a majority. It was daunting to the Prime Minister; he found himself at a stand-still - how could he convince moderates and conservatives to vote in favor of such a radical and reformist action?\n\nKatō, turning to the Prime Minister after a brief moment, suddenly proposed a counter offer as Takagi pinched the bridge of his nose in an exhausted and defeated frustration. She mentioned, to appease those who oppose the repeal, he could introduce legal protections expanding state welfare, childcare, and even legalizing abortion. Takagi looked up from his enraged despair, and with a confused smile he wagged his finger at her smug face. He refused to show his excitement; he wouldn't give her the satisfaction of being right.

After a particularly heated moment, Takagi rubbed his brow and asked for Ikeda's honest opinion of the move to repeal the Kokumin Yuseiho. Ikeda inhaled a large breath, and then relented, mentioning he was personally apathetic. What mattered, he insisted, was that the government had a system in place to defend the traditional morality of the nation. National Eugenics Law or not, Ikeda confessed, many conservatives would support a respectful homage to the traditions of the empire in the budget and government policy proposals.\n\nTakagi was silent, staring at the man in confusion. Surely it was not that easy, he thought, in denial of the whole affair. The Prime Minister, now at relative ease compared to the anger of the earlier argument, could not hide his astonishment; he had the information he needed to get the conservatives behind a replacement bill. He still had to wrestle with the legislature, but understanding the Ikeda's platform on abortion and other issues gave him information key to drawing up a potentially successful bill in the National Diet.

The air in the chamber suddenly grew thick and tense as Takagi began to sweat beneath his suit.

He cleared his throat, and peered across the chamber, brushing the room with his stern gaze - determined to pass this bill he had fought so intensely for. Takagi began to speak to the Diet, reading from a prepared speech, and maintained a calm and controlled decorum to distinguish his own authority over the diverging interests tearing the Taisei Yokusankai to pieces.\n\nComplete with all amendments, such as tightened restrictions on the period of pregnancy termination and a government-approved gynecological code of ethics, the bill had been taken apart and pieced back together many times over to find approval from the conservatives in the House of Peers. Takagi waved the bill, priding it for its comprehensive covering of modern attitudes towards women's health, whilst acknowledging a respectful relationship it had with traditional morality seen as virtuous across the nation. Despite this, however, the amendments did not inoculate the Prime Minister from scrutiny, and scowls from conservative factions of the Taisei Yokusankai were frequent as he gazed into the crowds of men scoffing at his works.\n\nThe Prime Minister finished his speech and sat down in the lukewarm tumble of applause that sounded from the Diet floor. He rested his breath and checked his pulse, calming himself down to remain still as the speaker began to gesture a vote."

Katō had passed the book club on her way to park her car, so it did not take her long to find her way back. She headed down the stairs and pushed open the door with the little bell on it. It was quiet inside. Despite the club's relatively small size, the only people she could see were the two members of staff. They did not do as much as greet Katō as she stepped inside. Immediately, she noticed that the corner table was unoccupied. Her watch told her she was exactly on time. The feeling of panic began to set in as she turned to look at the staff for a possible answer. The brief look she got from one of them turned panic into fear. With only his eyes, the staff member seemed to say:\n\n\"Run\"\n\nKatō turned back towards the door and raced up the steps. She was stopped in her tracks by three men, all pointing guns at her. Before Katō could verbalize a plea for understanding or dialogue, the butt of a pistol connected with the back of her skull. A moment later, she hit the ground."

Fittingly, it was Security Minister Horiki Zenjiro who brought it to the Prime Minister's office. He, and Deputy Prime Minister Kido, now waited to hear the news of Katō's arrest. For the benefit of the ministers, Takagi read the report aloud.\n\n\"At twenty-past eight this morning, four plainclothes agents entered an underground book club where Katō Shidzue was scheduled to meet three individuals. Upon identifying these individuals, the agents proceeded to draw their guns and arrest them. However, a struggle with one of the suspects insured, resulting in their death. The suspect, as so far only been identified by her cover name 'Thoreau'. At nine o'clock, Katō entered the building briefly before attempting to flee. She was promptly arrested by officers outside the building who were waiting in a nearby vehicle. The suspects were then taken to Tokkō Headquarters for questioning. Katō was then neutralised along with the two other suspects.\"\n\nTakagi finished reading and let the report fall onto his desk. Kido's face was a picture of confusion.\n\n\"Horikiri, surely this cannot be the entire report. What have they done to Katō?\"\n\n\"I checked with the Tokkō twice, this is their report.\"\n\nBefore Kido could demand that the Security Minister demand more information, Takagi cut him off.\n\n\"The details of what happened to Katō no longer matter. It's the consequences we should be worrying about. She was the figurehead of the protests and now she's missing. Once word of this spreads to the general public, they'll be no end to the chaos on the streets. We need to prepare for this, immediately.

 japtakagirecon.100.d:0 "The once lively and optimistic student movements that had filled the streets of Japan's cities had been replaced with two distinct forms of protests. Rioting had spread across the country like a storm, with its epicenter in Tokyo. There, armored police and water cannons had become common sights. Dozens of arrests were made each day and several universities had even been stormed by the police. While life carried on in Tokyo, an oppressive mood hung over the city. Yet In the quieter corners of Tokyo,, peaceful gatherings were still able to take place. At the spot where Katō Shidzue had last been seen, a candlelit vigil had begun, with hundreds in attendance. Apart from the sounds of distant police sirens, the street was completely quiet. At the top of the steps down into the book club basement, a number of signs had been placed with messages of appreciation for Katō and her activism. A young woman, one of the many students in attendance that had personally spoken to Katō, began to read a message she had written. The student hoped that somehow, whether Katō was, she would hear it and know that her sacrifice was not in vain. Before she had a chance to begin reading, a police car pulled up.\n\nRoof-mounted speakers loudly blared for the crowds to disperse, claiming that they were blocking a busy road. Without warning, the street began to flood with police, who set about dismantling the vigil. Those who did not move out of their way were beaten down or shoved forcefully to the ground. As more and more of the students attempted to get away, they found themselves surrounded by police from nearly every angle. What at first seemed like warning shots from the approaching police quickly began to hit the fleeing students. Panic and chaos set in, and the struggle to get away became increasingly desperate. Those caught by the police were pushed into vans and driven away, or otherwise beaten until let go. By the street was empty, the bodies of three students lay lifeless among the remains of the vigil."

Where once Tokyo had essentially been the only city that was being rocked by intense riots, now Nagoya and Osaka were also deeply affected. As the authorities' response to the demands of the students grew harsher and harsher, it seemed that the protesters only became more determined to fight back. Smashed windows, overturned cars and fires in the streets were now a common sight across several major cities. More peaceful gatherings were met with crackdowns from the police as soon as they sprung up. Simply being in some form of attendance was enough to warrant an arrest. Once released, they were usually beaten and bloodied, their bodies acting as a warning sign for what could happen if they did not stop protesting. Some were not so lucky. Many seemed to disappear, both literally and from police records. Others suffered the extreme brutality during the riots themselves. \"Inaccurate warning shots\" and \"falls\" were common excuses for the mounting pile of bodies.\n\nEven as the police deployed these measures against anyone found during a riot, it did nothing to end the unrest. The riots continued, growing larger and larger each day, as each death or disappearance added fuel to the fires. By this point, it was largely impossible for the general population to ignore the events happening outside their windows. Everyone knew a nephew or neighbour's child who had been blasted by a water cannon or bashed by a riot shield. Everyone had heard the stories of parents losing their children, deaths which the police or national media had yet to acknowledge.\n\nTokyo, Nagoya and Osaka were lit at night by the fires of unrest while similar flames promised to be enkindled across more cities. For the Prime Minister Takagi, the situation was exactly what he had hoped to avoid. Not only had he lost control of the protests, but now even the police were causing him trouble. Takagi could do little more than hope for a solution to materialize in time."

He had lectured her about the virtues of patriotism, trying to connect with her in supporting the government in such turbulent times.\n\n\"Citizens of our great nation, I greet you this evening to discuss the gathering threat to our great nation. I will not waste your time with pretty words and colorful images; the violence in our streets is unacceptable.

It is not worthy of the empire and all our forefathers have given us.\"\n\nThe father smiled, seeing the Prime Minister on the television, but lost his joy when looking over to his apathetic daughter, who seemed disinterested in the appeals of Takagi to end the riots.\n\n\"... Which is why this government has decided to strengthen the commission to reform the Kokumin Yuseiho. If the Emperor's subjects want change, change they shall get - we will begin hard work to craft an all-inclusive settlement of this issue once and for all. However, this can only be completed with the cooperation of all parties involved, and an end to the riots.\"\n\nThe teenage daughter scoffed, rolling her eyes at the broadcast - much to her father's disapproval. She grumbled, hurling insults at the Prime Minister for his arrogance and misogyny before storming off to her bedroom. The girl's father was astonished and remained still in his seat, shocked by the encounter.

It was late evening, though the night sky was lit with the embers of dumpster fires and makeshift floodlights. Supported by armored vehicles, the police units trudged forward towards the chaotic crowds now scampering to face them. Bracing, they lifted their shields as thrown bricks and other debris clattered against their armor. Clashes between law enforcement and protesters erupted, and many officers were outnumbered by the maddened students.\n\nSuddenly, a crashing burst of water shot across the road and hurled many students to the ground. The water cannons were used to support the encircled officers and back the students away from them. Moreover, the pop of teargas canisters among the ruined streets dispersed many of the rioters, allowing the police units to sweep in and contain the demonstrations. Students were beaten in the streets, and hundreds of arrests were made that night.

The current administration cannot go on like this. As it sits around and grows lazy, our overseas costs rise every year, but the revenue we earn from these possessions does not. It would benefit the main bureau as well to overhaul the local governments installed directly in the region, who will then allow us to push for development and in the long run greatly increase our yields while also improving the livelihood of the natives.\" said Takagi, confident in his speech.\n\n\"No. We won't continue to discuss this for much longer. It has dragged on, and nothing more can be said,\" replied the opposition's leader.\n\n\"Fine, if you will not accept the full request, how about we compromise?\" stated Takagi. \"While we shall not implement the strengthening of locally-constructed governments, you must still support the rest of it. We will, absolutely will, be expanding our lucrative businesses in our colonial possessions and strengthening Imperial administrations in these locations, in places like Choson and Taiwan,\" said Takagi defiantly.\n\n\"Accepted. Let us move on, now,\" said the opposition's leader.\n\nTakagi sighed in relief."
 japtakagirecon.118.d:0 "「そんなに難しくなかったでしょう、皆さん？」提督は執務室の革張りの椅子に凭れながら、顎の先をつまんで苦笑いをした。特に中曽根は、高木の植民地改革計画の費用負担について若気の至りで反対した。何時間にもわたる議論、論争、個人的な侮辱の末に、首相は内閣を集めて植民地改革に関する政府の立場を合意させたのである。首相の説得力のある言葉のおかげか、それとも同僚たちが疲れて自分の立場を譲ったおかげか、これで姿勢が決まり、彼らは解散となった。\n\n彼らが折りかばんと上着を手にすると、提督は部屋の奥、卓の下に置かれた自分の椅子のすぐ後ろに立っていた。ほんの数時間前まで、同じ男たちが不平不満に満ちた表情で、普通の人なら数分も考えないような複雑な議論を交わしていたのだから、と彼はほくそ笑んだ。善次郎が高木にうなずいて出て行き、ドアを閉めると、部屋は耳をつんざくような静けさに包まれた。あまりの静けさに、高木は息をするたびに、空気が古ぼけた風琴を鳴らす音が聞こえるほどだった。\n\n椅子の背もたれに寄りかかり、革張りのヘッドレストを握りながら、彼は考えた。無理しすぎたのか？彼は天皇から任命された宰相であり、強大な権力を授かっている。たとえそれが大臣の一人や二人を怒らせることになっても、国家の利益のために政治を行う権利があるのだ。"
 japtakagirecon.119.d:0 "The mighty blast and rumble of an erupting volcano shook the waters around New Britain, and a great burning wave of air rushed throughout the island. The roar of volcanic fury swept through the land and seas, as if the embers of Hell had risen to Earth to scorch the untamed wild of the islands in the South Pacific. Running for cover, locals dispersed into the woodlands in search of shelter but mostly found themselves entrapped within, the now dense and scalding air burning their skin. Immense clouds of ash towered over the surrounding villages and snaked into the air, dwarfing any vestige of human civilization that survived the damning blast.\n\nIn the distance, an unusually large fleet of Japanese ships approached the islands, riding the crashing waves in armed droves. In the cooking-hot sun, the metal ships sailed the seas and navigated the coast to observe the chaos. Sailors scattered in groups on the deck of the titanic ships, gazing at the explosive marvel spewing great clouds of ash and rivers of steaming-hot lava. They watched from afar, in absolute awe of the terrific sight of nature's cruel beauty, seemingly ignoring the wailing pleas of natives for evacuation, continuing to witness the fearsome strength of the natural world as it ravaged the peace and fertility of the isles."
 japtakagirecon.120.d:0 "The girl knew what she was doing was wrong, that she would be in big trouble if she were to be caught; she saw what they did to her friends' parents over a stolen bag of rice. Yet the consequences of her failure only made the act even more thrilling.\n\nRight before sunset, she began her great heist. She had snuck through the window of the bathroom with a bit of noise, but nothing loud enough to give her away. For a moment, she doubted herself. What if she really was caught? What if they found out her parents' names? What would they do to her family? Her mother always chastised her for her antics, but her friends called her the Monkey of Dapu. She grinned. She wouldn't dare let that reputation die now. She'd have a prize for them yet.\n\nShe slipped her way into the hallway, then the kitchen and finally, the living room. She looked around, and for a moment in the darkness of the dimly lit room she couldn't see anything; then, there it was, hanging from the wall. Climbing atop a table, with some effort to reach, she seized it.\n\nThen, a door slammed. Footsteps echoed in the hall, and the girl's blood ran cold. She stumbled off the table and darted back the way she came, into the bathroom and right out the window into some bushes. She sighed in relief, her heart pounding. She looked down at her prize, and she would've giggled with joy if she weren't trying to be inconspicuous. Slowly, she slipped the blade away from its sheath, the last light of the sun twinkling off of its shimmering steel. The Japanese so loved their swords, passing them down from one generation to the next over hundreds if not thousands of years. They cherished them as symbols of honor, of family, of wisdom. In a way, they were the embodiment of Japan's glory and destiny to rule all the corners of the east.\n\nAnd now one was in the grubby hands of the Monkey of Dapu. She couldn't help herself; she giggled. She couldn't wait to show her friends!"

Shower, eat, exercise, as he had always done since Army Cadet School, even if he wasn't as fast as he used to be. Like most 70 year old men, he'd grown weaker in his old age, less agile, slow of body, but not of mind. As much as he could, he liked to keep his body's degeneration to a minimum by taking care of himself.\n\nFinally, when he had finished his jumping jacks and pushups, he headed out onto his balcony, where he would have his morning tea and read the latest news brought to him by his servants. The sound of the South China Sea washed over him as he sipped from his glass.\n\nAh yes, stock prices seemed to be rising again, a sign of a healthy economy, surely.\n\nThat new American President seemed to be having a tough go of it with all that civil rights talk, Baba didn't understand why they didn't just use the military to silence all this dissent.\n\nAs he flipped the page, taking another sip of his tea, his eyes bulged as he read the headline, trying hard not to spit out the liquid in his mouth.\n\nNORTH BORNEO: ECONOMIC SINKHOLE\n\nThe article went on to elaborate how the region was a terrible spot for any entrepreneurial activity, as its corrupt administrative apparatus required constant bribery for continued operation in the area. Not only that, but its brutal treatment of its native population resulted in a less than ideal workforce.\n\nBaba couldn't believe he was reading this about his own administration. How did this get out? Someone was going to pay."
 japtakagirecon.122.d:0 "The Chief Petty Officer peeked into his boresight, aligning the five-inch cannon. The rocking of the destroyer on waves of the South China Sea would make aiming the weapon difficult for anyone unaccustomed to naval warfare, but the Chief had a lifetime of practice. His loader remained silent next to him, reading a magazine, the man was useless until the action started. The chief regarded him for a moment before glancing back into the boresight, moonlight shimmering over the peaceful waters, showing its beauty to him and only him. He had fallen in love with the sea at a young age, and even now, years later, that love had not waned. He knew that he'd stay in the navy until retirement, out here with the waves and gulls, it was the only place that made him truly, wholly, happy. He'd never leave it of his own volition.\n\nThen he saw it, a light coming from the coast the destroyer had been cruising along for the better part of an hour. Show time. He whacked his loader on the shoulder without looking away from his sight, rotating the gun to face the light and zooming in with his sight. It was a small coastal village from the looks of it. A large fire burned in the center of it, with people dancing, enjoying the night. He saw the happy faces of celebration on each man, woman, and child's face. He began calculating the range in his head, adjusting the elevation, and with a terrible blast, he fired.\n\nThe white phosphorus shell sailed flawlessly into the crowd of people, encompassing all around the fire in a burning white cloud. The closest buildings instantly ignited as the fire began to spread. People ran out of the white cloud, flesh melting from bone, faces twisted in horror and pain. He fired again, and again, and again, as fast as his loader could breach a shell.\n\nWhen it was over, nothing remained of the village but burning rubble. Any and all possible rebels or partisans were dead."
 japtakagirecon.123.d:0 "Takagi took his spot at the podium, reading over his notes for the final time. Soft chatter echoed around the chamber from the members of the Diet as they waited for him to begin. He knew this had been a long time coming.\n\n\"Members of the Diet, I come before you today because I wish to start a dialogue about an important issue in our administration. General Baba Masao, a veteran administrator and commander operating in North Borneo, has served his due time for our nation and the Emperor. I ask of you all, this hero deserves to return home in his old age.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment and looked over the reaction of the Diet. Most were silent, some nodded along, and a vocal few recognized what he was trying to do.\n\n\"I propose a solution to the vacancies left in the North Borneo administration from Mister Masao's departure: a partition of land between its Southeast Asian neighbors. I would wish this matter to be handled in a way that honors the Empire and allows the General to return home for his much earned rest. I believe these actions would not only honor Mister Masao's service, but also alleviate the situation on the ground. Thank you, members of the Diet.\"\n\nHe turned and sat back down as the arguments started, the Diet beginning a heated discussion over everything he had said. Some decried the proposed plan to partition North Borneo, although most agreed that Masao had to be removed. Takagi sighed, such is politics."

They were ones without homes or prospects for the future, without money or food. They were the most desperate of the desperate, the festering dregs of Japan's forgotten poor.\n\nThe recruiters offered them a new chance at life beyond the isles, a fresh start and the opportunity to spread the rising sun's rays further across the world. Some distrusted their words, seeing them as too good to be true, but, well, they wouldn't have been there if they refused. In the end, they all saw no better option to escape the brick wall their lives were approaching.\n\nWhen they arrived on the isolated Vitu Islands and the downtrodden were forced off ship, many suspicions among them were raised. The officers finally announced the true intentions of this journey; they were there to establish an outpost to act as a foothold for the island of New Britain south of there, for the glory of the Empire and the Co-Prosperity Sphere. They would be given adequate rations and starting supplies, but otherwise they would have to utilize the islands' own resources.\n\nThat was when the panic began. In truth, almost none of them knew how to build even a hut of straw, much less how to fend for themselves on a group of tiny islands thousands of kilometers away from home. Some began by protesting, desperately trying to explain how it must've been some kind of mistake. They begged, they pleaded, but the crew and the guards responded only by stern orders to get to work. Then a man tried to seize an officer's gun, a blow was struck, and suddenly the entire 'expedition' tried to storm back onboard.\n\nChaos reigned for a full hour, and when the dust settled, five of the volunteers lay dead, their blood spilt on a distant beach. Frustrated, the crew threw the boxes of rations to the survivors and set sail for home, not even giving them the supplies. As the sun reached its noon zenith, a lone volunteer cried out in frustration and fear."

His business was running on its last legs, crippled by numerous debts, and now the government wanted its dirty fingers in, too. Ominous and mysterious as ever, they sent a representative without warning to \"discuss an important topic.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ebihara, let's get straight to the point,\" their representative said, his words prickling Tetsuo's skin, \"You probably already know about recent developments on the New Britain archipelago. We will soon solve the problem with the natives, but the only thing we need from you is your cooperation. You specialize in logging, correct? New Britain would be an ideal place for expansion.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't come here just to tell me that,\" Ebihara replied.\n\n\"Let me continue. If you sign this contract, we will grant your company five-hundred square kilometers of fine rainforest and the land under it, to do as you will with. However, we will require a promise that you will develop the land. Once it is in our interest, we will of course keep you from collapsing under the weight of your debts.\"\n\nEbihara looked up to the Mephistopheles sitting opposite of him, acknowledging that he had promised him the world and some more. There must be a catch, he thought, but the raw appeal of the deal distracted him from the potential to be caught up in mystery clauses and damning loopholes.\n\n\"What I need to sign?\" Ebihara said, peering up at the representative's growing smile."
 japtakagirecon.126.d:0 "Accompanied by IJN marines, geological surveyors and businessmen examined and scaled the resource-rich areas of New Britain due for extraction. They were tasked with the eviction of natives from their villages on the land, and approached the local leaders with the aid of translators. Attempting to negotiate, the businessmen tried every trick they knew to convince the natives to leave and alluded to financial compensation, but to no avail. With every word the businessmen uttered, a deeper red flush of anger swept over their faces as they too began to realise the ignorance and insanity of their proposition.\n\nIn their dealings, an altercation arose from a dispute; the natives were outraged at the ignorance and greed shown by the foreigners. The negotiators retreated back to their encampment, scampering to escape from the increasingly rowdy crowds now gathered to heckle at the negotiators. With the failure to make a deal, it had been noted by field command that the marines were sanctioned to use deadly force in response to any resistance; they cocked their rifles and leapt from the back of military vehicles, marching to the settlements with cold, objectifying stares.\n\nMoving into the small village, the marines opened fire and mowed down the natives for having the gall to resist the \"negotiations\". The crackle of gunshots and wails of natives could be heard from the distance as the surveyors awkwardly awaited clearance from the IJN. Runaways were shot, homes were burned, and survivors were beaten for their disobedience. As the businessmen and negotiators re-entered the village they were met with scowls from the surviving and subdued locals."

Fen watched the sunset from the rickety balcony, ever-so-slightly creaking as she lit the lanterns. She rushed to the front of her house, turning on the porch lights, to give anyone walking outside some light to find their way back home. Ever since the power had gone out - it had never come back on for about five years - they had all agreed to light up the streets by whatever means they could. For Fen, it was porch lights, for others, it was via lanterns and candles. As she fiddled with the batteries, the day finished its transition into dusk. One minute, the streets were dark. The next, all of the street and the houses were soaked in golden light.\n\nTens of people, from the elderly, to the children who had barely learned to walk, rushed out of their homes, stunned by the sudden brightness. The tall white poles shone once more, as metal roofs and rickety wooden porches became bright as day. Perhaps it was useless to those outside of the slums, but to the inhabitants here, this light was as beautiful as gold."

Now, after all of his strenuous efforts, it was buried under the constant stream of cars that would bring him home. Today, like any Friday, the hordes of cars turned into a gas-fuming swamp. If Ruogang was lucky enough, he would be home by ten, but even then the only thing he could do during a coveted moment of solitude would be to prepare a simple dinner, set an alarm, and hope that he wasn't tired enough to oversleep. There must be another way, he thought.\n\nAn old mountain road. Feng once told him that he sometimes takes it just to escape traffic jams. It was quite an awkwardly disguised route, but if all urban routes were clogged it should be a faster way to get home. Ruogang smiled, for perhaps the first time in a week, and approached his old Toyota. It was not as shiny as it was seven years ago, but it still did the job well enough, just as he did. Ruogang passed a dozen odd streets just to find one Feng mentioned, but in the end he found an exit from the claustrophobic city and drove down the old mountain road.\n\nThe path was bumpy, rattling his car constantly, considerably worse than what Feng told him. The road was covered in potholes, ruined by age and poorly lit with flickering bulbs only every few minutes. Even a seemingly safe stretch of the path could be dangerous. It was almost nine, and as his urge to speed up the journey bubbled in his chest, Ruogang stepped on the gas pedal and clenched his hands on the wheel. His eyes were tired and drowsy. His head hit the ceiling of the car, his hands flew off the wheel, the vehicle tipped over, and he gazed into the fast-approaching forested earth below."

Giggling and restless, the boys greeted their mother back.\n\n\"Konnichiwa okasan!\"\n\nHer eyes widened and her jaw dropped as her children skipped away to play in their room. Confusion ran through her head and hammered at her skull; she wondered why her own sons did not greet her in their native Taiwanese Hokkien language. It must have been the schools, she thought as she panicked, unsure of how to react. Her sons always praised the way things were in Japan; they watched Japanese television, read Japanese stories, ate Japanese foods, and much to her prickling resentment, they were losing their own Taiwanese identity she had taught them."

He was paid enough to afford his food and bills, but could not scrape enough pay together for much else. It was a simple living, but he, like many other miners in the region, was always on the lookout to make extra money for himself if he could.\n\nOn one of the night shifts, Sung-Nam and a few other miners were working in the deepest tunnels of the mine; they were tasked with the extraction of wolframite, one of the rare and valuable ores that processed into tungsten, a vital component in the arms industry that ran the imperial war machine. They hammered and drilled chunks of the ore from the walls of the mine for hours at a time, but the twinkling glimpse of a shiny, silver material had caught Sung-Nam's eye. Acknowledging that supervisors were absent in the early hours of the morning, the impoverished miners discussed and gathered around the vein; no one knew what the material was, but split equally between them, it was sure to sell for a high price.\n\nSome time after his tiresome shift, Sung-Nam went to the local market, filled to the brim with the chatter of people and little shops packed with trinkets and fragrances. Bargaining with a merchant, he sold the mineral for a hefty sum, almost half of his usual salary. The ore probably cost a lot more, but he was happy with the price he sold for, as for the first time in months he could afford a fresh and juicy cut of meat for dinner."

After some time, he decided to gaze out the window, and he saw a beautiful plain of fields, with luscious bright green grass. In that instant, his body shot forward and he heard a bellowing crash.\n\nInvestigators arrived at the incident site only three hours later; the train was in utter ruin - the carts had flown off the rails and were scattered across the field, some of them were still burning. Most of the passengers managed to crawl out of overturned carts and expose their seared flesh to the beaming sun. Many were not so lucky, and rows of lifeless bodies were left lying on the burned grass, covered by dirty white sheets. Upon further examination, investigators noticed something wrong with the rails - the steel was ripped and chewed apart like rotting wood.\n\nThe track geometry report concluded that this section of railroad was in no condition to sustain high-speed trains, and was in need of modernization. Trains swarm the plains and hills of Northern Choson like blowflies, the investigators noted, and this incident may be the first of many more potential disasters in the future. The report was shuffled about the various levels of administration in Choson, until finally reaching Tokyo, where it held the attention of the Prime Minister, who had become concerned over the frequency of the disasters."

He always was a rebellious boy, fighting authority in ways that often caused more harm than good.\n\nA sudden knock hammered from outside of the barn - they had been found.\n\n\"Sung-Chul, our death... will it not be in vain?\"\n\nHe was at a loss for words, unable to react. Their lonely resistance cell was discovered before they could do anything worthwhile. The Tokkō's forces had stormed their improvised hideout and killed most of them in the raid, and only a lucky few found a way out to disperse through the night to safety.

The offices of the administration lay in the north, the mountainous and craggy terrain of Sarawak spread out behind them, hiding the high jungles with a veil of grey mist. The warm winds blew seawards, venting the oppressive heat from Sakai's body. His destination was a shrine on one of the hilltops near the administrative complexes. Masao often meditated there when he was not whipping the locals to submission or bullying his subordinates.\n\nNeedless to say, Sakai hated his role as a courier. At least the news was good - for Masao. The feeling of discomfort grew, blossomed, and flared within his chest as his feet drew closer to the shrine. Every instinct in his body told him to bolt into the nearest jungle, to escape Masao's clutches forever. However, the high, veiled forests coldly looked on. They would not help a man escape civilization.\n\nWhen Sakai reached Masao, he found the old commander meditating, his posture cross-legged. Sakai was a courier, a soldier: he had no business kicking a hornet's nest, and so he decided to wait. Standing on the entrance of the shrine awkwardly, he waited until Masao opened his eyes and stood. Sakai called out to him. \"Masao-sama.\" He said. \"A message, from the headquarters. A most auspicious piece of news Masao-sama. They will let you stay here for another year.\"\n\nMasao smiled. \"Dismissed. Thank you.\" Better a quick dismissal than bullying, Sakai supposed.

Where would he go now, he thought, his thoughts tossing, turning, listing from port to starboard every few minutes.\n\nLooking back on his days on the ship, Hisaguchi would never have thought that he would become the administrator of a portion of Karenko. At first, he had hoped that he would be placed in Tainan, where it was the most Japan-like.

Masao found it hard to believe that years could pass him by as easily as leaves picked off by the wind. At least his uniform was still in an acceptable condition. Medals gleamed on his chest. He heard a knock on the door. It was time to go.\n\nOutside, crowds of the natives greeted Masao. He got into the car, and the parade began. To his left and right the copper-skinned and sunburnt inhabitants of this place threw out cheers to him, hailing him as a hero, or so he thought. They could have been as easily throwing insults and jeers, happy that the Japanese military governor would be gone, perhaps forever. Masao preferred to look for the silver lining. He would see Japan again. A return to Kumamoto was no longer a dream.\n\nOnce they were out of sight of the crowds, Masao sat down in his car, exhausted, for some reason. His tears welled up.

Maybe Headquarters was looking for a survey on the youth's interests in literature.\n\nThen, an acquaintance! He set himself down on a chair opposite to her, and spoke. Of what?

No. They talked about the arrangement of flowers. \"I am serious,\" Kenshin wrote in his small notepad. \"They talked about flower arrangement for nearly two hours.

The next morning's newspaper issue featured Tanaka's embarrassing gap-tooth and was headlined: BORING MAYOR CAUGHT RED-HANDED IN CORRUPTION SCHEME."
 japtakagirecon.139.d:0 "昭南、インドネシア、フィリピンの使者が川崎に集まり、北ボルネオの行方を話し合うために飛行機から降りてきて、派手な国際協調を示している。しかし、首相は写真機の閃光をものともせず、外交官たちを大広間に急行させ、北ボルネオ軍政終結のための協議を開始し、合意を取り付けた。\n\n首相は、円卓を囲んで議論しながら、この地域の領土の将来について3カ国間の協議を誘導した。高木は、外交官たちに多くの計画を提案し、それぞれの使節の具体的な、時には理不尽な要求をこなそうとし、首相とその忍耐力を消耗させた。高木は、外交官たちの口論から少し離れ、このような権力者たちに奴隷のように仕えることが、この場にいる宰相の姿なのだろうかと考えた。高木がいなくなったことに外交官たちは気づかなかったようだ。高木は、何時間もの口論を覚悟し、疲れた目と無理やり作った笑顔で自分の仕事に戻った。"
 japtakagirecon.140.d:0 "高木は早朝に内閣と会談した。ほとんどの部下が疲れており、中には寝台から這い出るのもやっとで、まだあくびをしている者もいたが、高木は目を覚まし、新鮮な気持ちで行動に移した。しかし、高木は目を覚まし、準備万端整えていた。ニューブリテン島の入植地の採算を取るには、政府が早急に何百万円もの補助金を出して、この地の開発を支援しなければならない。\n\nその提案のあまりの大きさに、閣僚たちは目を疑った。中曽根は、その提案に笑いをこらえきれずに、大きく息を吐いて笑った。しかし、首相はそうはいかず、中途半端に起きている大臣を睨みつけるように言った。しばらくして、投資の必要性と補助金を出したことを撤回した場合の利害関係を部下に説明した後、閣議決定され、高木はほっとした。"
 japtakagirecon.141.d:0 "高木は、ニューブリテン島の問題で再び内閣と会談し、部下を執務室に集めて軽食を振る舞った。しかし、残念ながら、彼らは昼過ぎには酔いも覚め、高木の提案するとんでもない規模の大きさを十分に理解することができないでいた。\n\n高木が「ニューブリテン島には、当初の倍以上の投資が必要だ」と主張すると、閣僚たちは恥ずかしそうに溜息をついた。高木は、彼らの軽蔑を受け止め、目を丸くして、数字だけでなく長期的な視野に立つよう内閣に促した。メラネシアに恒久的な足場を築くことは、日本にとって大きな勝利となる。中曽根は鼻の下をつまんだ。木戸が最初に渋々同意し、徐々に他の者もそれに続いた。首相は部下に礼を言い、酒を勧めたが、部下は丁寧に断りの言葉を口にした。"
 japtakagirecon.142.d:0 "ニューブリテン島の開発について、ようやく詳細な報告が来た。島中に入植地ができ、製油所では異常な勢いで石油が湧き出しているが、事業に投じた資金を回収するには十分ではない。高木は、この報告書に何か良い点はないかと探したが、結局見つからず、怒りのあまり、報告書を握り潰し、部屋の中に投げ捨てた。\n\n夜も更け、いよいよ閣僚への公開の時間である。彼の手下たちが一日の疲れを癒すように、穏やかでくつろいだ雰囲気の中で共有することができる。重役会議室での公開に臨む首相に、彼らはグラスを鳴らし、拍手を送った。そして、島の雇用の状況や、海洋掘削による生産高の高騰などを、色とりどりに説明した。高木が投資で得た利益を告白するまでは、内閣は拍手喝采、感激しきりであった。ぱっとしない数字が大臣たちを震撼させた。首相は恥ずかしさのあまり唇をかみしめ、平凡な言葉を並べるしかなかった。"
 japtakagirecon.143.d:0 "In a small and isolated primary school by beach fronts of Soshiete-Shoto, an Austronesian boy gazed out of the window to admire a bird waddling about the sun-drenched coast. It flapped its majestic wings proudly, and irked its head back and forth as it strolled down the sandy beaches. The boy was pleased to be distracted from his Japanese class; he hated the subject, and would miss it at any opportunity he could take.\n\nMs. Asagiri, the boy's Japanese teacher, noticed his negligence and screamed his name, demanding he came to the front of the class. He was violently pulled from his serene daydreaming as the entire class of students turned to gaze at him with worry. Shocked with horror, his teacher furiously marched over to him with a deathly stare; she took his hands and dragged him to the chalkboard.\n\nHe was interrogated in front of his peers, and he broke down into tears out of lonesome embarrassment. She heckled his name mockingly, and beat him with a cane to punish him for his laziness in class and neglect of his study of the Japanese language. Ashamed and humiliated, the boy whimpered further, crying and wailing as his fellow students watched on, frozen by fear."
 japtakagirecon.144.d:0 "As Ms. Asagiri looked up to her students watching in horror of her beatings, her face grew red with frustration. In disciplining the Austronesian boy, she attempted to instill a fear and respect in the other students to discipline them also, but rather she frightened the children in a moment of rage. She bore her teeth and waved her cane, causing the children to shriek.\n\nSuddenly, the bird from the beachfront swooped into the room and flapped around Ms. Asagiri. Its golden feathers shimmered in the slithers of sunlight that reached into the classroom, and flapped around her face to cause her to panic and drop her cane. She darted over the floor to grab the stick to attack the bird, and in that moment, the crying boy leapt from her lap and scurried out of the classroom, still glossy-eyed and sore from her punishments.\n\nWith the shrieking of the classroom still audible to the boy, he dashed down to the beachfront to escape his teacher's abuse and play in the sand. As the fresh, salty air blew on his face, he felt the energy to run into the sunlit shore and wash his feet in the foamy waters. He felt the fresh brush of the sea between his small toes and the small pebbles beneath his soles. The boy turned to look behind him and he saw the bird zipping out of the window of the classroom and into the azure Melanesian skies; they both knew the freedom of the natural world, and the peace that came with the glimmering seashores."

Their economic policies of nationalization and borderline autarky are fundamentally opposed to our goals for the Japanese Empire. The technocrat connections to the army are especially troubling for us, as their extra-parliamentary ally stands to gain much from their success. Allowing the army to regain their hold on the Diet would be truly disastrous. Fortunately for us, the IJA's corruption has spilled over onto the technocrats.\n\nTheir extensive association with duplicitous members of the army is more than enough evidence for us to attack. In fact, their cooperation could be considered to be extra-constitutional in certain situations. That, coupled with the allegations of bribery that our investigators have already uncovered, should be more than enough to sweep through the technocrat ranks."
