The pilots and officers remained bullies, sure, but this one treated them differently.\n\nIn the end, Valdemar decided not to worry. He was only a tiny pawn in their great game, and he knew too little to comprehend the sudden changes. He decided to enjoy and and make the most out of the new, abrupt normal. When the German asked if everything was clear, the young man nodded vigorously. The officer returned his smile. Valdemar felt his own grow. Perhaps things really were changing after all."

Their expressions likely can't be any more different: Germania's bureaucrats', the Reichskommissar imagines, sport bewilderment at the number of zeros his balance sheets report.

For all the improvements he'd seen from the Germans, public transportation was not one of them.\n\nNo, they'd made improvements in other places, like in the landscape Valdemar had stared enraptured from the cracked window for the past few weeks. What was once a small, placid forest now bristled with industry and construction; trees of concrete replaced trees of wood while machinery the likes of which he'd never seen flattened the clearing and dug foundations out of it, day after day. Smoke now billowed from tall chimney stacks as trucks lined the pristine macadam road with materials to and from the new manufacturing complex.\n\nEveryone had felt these new changes, even the locals. Valdemar himself astounded at how much more food he could buy with his wages now that prices had dropped. He wrung his wristwatch with a smile - a cheap trinket, with its timekeeper so small he can barely keep time with it. But it was a wristwatch nevertheless.\n\nAs the bus went past the new industrial quarter, Valdermar's eyes honed into its most bewildering feature: small, practical cabins for the homeless Angolans. No doubt made of the forest that had once stood here. In truth he can't wrap his head around their hows and whys; Angolan timber was valuable, so why waste it on people like him - slaves in all but name? This \"Schenck\" everyone was talking about, why was he so interested in looking out after them?\n\nThe young Angolan knew there was something more to it; in the end, he probably won't ever know.

Their uniforms were tailored the same, but the crowd's disbelieving stares told Valdemar that he stuck out among the rest.

One Drucklufthämmer can pierce the hardest stone in seconds; combined with the newfangled electric carts, and not one spine had snapped delivering iron ore to the surface since.\n\nThe mine's director had complained at first, moreso when ordered to retrain the natives in \"matters better left to Aryans\" and increase their wages when all they deserved was \"a whipping to remind them of their place in Aryan society.\" His tune changed when he read the reports: the director's eyes almost popped out of their skull when he landed on a quota figure with what was clearly a misprint of extra zeroes. His complaints left as fast as they appeared after the majority shareholder telephoned him to \"shut his trap and let the money flow\".\n\nThe natives of Benguela largely ignored such great gains, but they felt their effects. Death rates had dropped to single digits, and the workers' wages had grown large enough to afford canned goods, bicycles, and even store-bought medicines.

Also, should the bandits attack native patrols, they would be blamed by the population, an unwise move even for the dumbest leader.\n\nWe shall create several new auxiliary units, giving them what they need to keep order, but now a second question arises. How much should we pay them? On one hand, there is no need to be excessively generous: after all, being paid is already a good thing in Afrika, but the promise of bigger rewards could lure many towards desertion. On the other, we could go for the safe route and pay them enough to never make them want to betray us: it would be even costlier, but we would no longer have to worry about the home front, at least on the short term."

The first involves massively employing the natives in garrisoning duties, a costly solution but one which would surely keep the natives happy as the new patrols would never resort to inhuman tactics, and their families would enjoy better living standards. The second - oh God please forgive me for what I'm going to say - is to request help from our \"colleagues\" in Ostafrika: they know everything about keeping order, but the cost... the cost may be more than we could ever pay in our lifetimes."

But he did not deserve clear skies, only shadows. All the better to hide in, a coward, a traitor with false heart and no conviction.\n\nWar in Germany. Crows fighting for the corpse of the fatherland. War in Afrika. A pointless struggle to maintain a pointless system. Failing colonies defended by a shield of SS fanatics and corrupt mercenaries. Led by Reichskommissar Schenck, the most despicable of them all.\n\nIn the sky, he could lose himself, pretend to be a better man. Helping the natives. Giving them the means of overthrowing the Germans. It was remarkably simple; nobody audited Südwestafrika, especially not in these times of civil war. A better man than Schenck would have done this a long time ago.\n\nIn the distance, the changing of the guards. Good lads, here to avoid a life of drudgery in Germany. Men worried sick about news from the fatherland. Soldiers who trusted in the Reichskommissar to save them from the South Africans and the Americans. Perhaps it was not too late for Schenck to choose the easy path, trading his conscience for the men who, like him, served an empty master. A salve to make the pain easier to bear.\n\nA decision.

There was nothing left in Westafrika but small mud huts to bomb, and the dunces in the Luftwaffe called it \"training\".\n\nSometimes, he wonders if he should have died flying during the war. A burst of tracers through the cockpit - life ends, curtains fall, his Vaterland and family would remember him a hero, and that would've been the end of it. Dying as he lived, mid-flight. Schenck sighed. Instead, he had a career, and ceaseless nightmares."

No matter how desperate the situation, the proud men of the Luftwaffe would never stoop so low as flying planes maintained by the natives. Better to keep up a pure, if increasingly ragged, air force, they would say.\n\nBut there were only so many proud Aryans in Afrika. And without air cover, many more would die fighting in the south. Südwestafrika's air bases were already running into staff shortages, and using locals to maintain planes under German supervision would free up an immense amount of resources. Until now, the native employees had only been trusted to refuel planes and moving equipment. With this new order, the simplest planes would be entrusted to native mechanics, recruited from trusted African SS units, freeing German technicians to tend to the more complex machines. And perhaps, when all was done, the African technicians would have some money to bring back home.\n\nThen again, it would take considerable energy to get the new technician corps started, only to hear the men of the Luftwaffe roar with indignation that he'd even considered letting the Africans anywhere close to their jets."

Aircraft were pushed past the limits of their maintenance cycles, so that the swamped maintenance personnel could have more time to ready another set of worn aircraft for another sortie.\n\nWhat wasn't working, however, was the pilot side of this cycle. A sharp increase in pilot accidents, some deadly, indicated to Luftwaffe command that the pilots needed more rest.\n\nNow, air crews are shuffled between air wings, so that the balance of personnel may be optimized. Pilots operate on a day-on-day-off system; on the first day, air crews are on alert for twelve hours of high readiness, followed by twelve hours of low readiness, where there should be ample time for rest between sorties, should the call come. On the second day, pilots shall, in essence, be granted a day of rehabilitation, resting for the trials of the next day.\n\nSuch a process won't allow us to squeeze quite as much out of our pilots as before, however, their combat readiness will be much greater, and hopefully we won't see any more deadly incidents involving pilot error."

As Schenck monitored the first day's progress, he saw the instructors surprised at the speed of their charges' learning.

He would rather collapse upon his bed and forget the woes of the world, but there was yet work to be done, and this particular task had to be done alone.\n\nAgain, he stared at the phone which sat menacingly upon his desk. Cold sweat covered his body. He had given express orders for no one to disturb him. Though few would at such an hour, he had to be certain that none would overhear. Schenck took one final breath, and dialed.\n\nA familiar voice filled his ear. \"Herr Schenck!\" it spoke, \"How good to hear from you again!\" it finished, with a chilling, deceptive kindness.\n\n\"Well,\" Schenck replied, \"I wished to inquire on the matter of our partnership. Has - has the board come to a decision?\" he finished, with a nervous swallow.\n\n\"Ah, Herr Schenck. I am afraid that the board has convened and decided that your proposed venture is unfitting for the company. We apologize, and hope that you understand our decision.\" the voice said brightly.\n\n\"Yes. Of course. Thank you.\" Schenck said, as the telephone slipped from his grip. The receiver dangled inches above the floor, as Schenck slouched into his seat, lost to hopeless despair."

The truth here in the Reichskommissariat is that we need weapons.\" A kernel of truth - Südwestafrika needed weapons, but not for war. His secret project demanded a constant, and ample, supply of arms. The African heat did not seem to hold back his chills.\n\n\"Herr Schenck,\" the voice said, even-toned as always, \"for America to arm her enemy - even one who decides to cooperate with her - she would need justification.\" A pause over on the other end. \"As we all Americans say, friendship is a two-way street. If you are not willing to divulge the purposes of such armaments, there is only so much I can do to convince the Agency's brass to give you what you want. I hope you understand my position here. I am a liaison, not a plenipotentiary.\"\n\nSchenck had to be careful. Now was not the time to tell the Americans what he had in mind. \"Mr. Lansdale, I can guarantee that the usage of such armaments would not be against Americans,\" Schenck said, speaking slowly to mask his chattering teeth. \"If you need more reassurance, the next time we talk, it would be about an American object of interest. We shall discuss oil. I promise that I will give you full attention when the time comes.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Lansdale did not seem to have the highest opinion of him. \"I'll bring it up with the Agency.

Naturally, Schenck masked it as construction material, giving express orders not to open the cargo. He doubted all of his soldiers shared his intentions, and should Hüttig or Müller realize what he planned, his project would fall like a house of cards. Despite the calm he projected to his secretary, Schenck was walking a tightrope.\n\n\"The manifests are here, sir,\" the secretary said. Ever faithful and trustworthy, the man had proven himself a source of sorely-needed help for Schenck. It took a moment for Schenck to remember the young man's name - Wilhelm. \"As you can see here, and here,\" Wilhelm said, pointing to certain lines in the manifests, \"the boys have delivered it to the locations specified.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Wilhelm. I wouldn't know what to do without you.\" Schenck smiled. Though Schenck was a pilot, he admitted that he had no head for numbers. The Reichskommissar of Südwestafrika would rather delegate what he considered the dull parts of his job to his subordinates. If only all of them were as competent -\n\n\"If I may ask, sir,\" Wilhelm said, his voice hesitant, \"what is the purpose of all this secrecy?\"\n\nSchenck had nothing to tell him."

He realized that he had become a pretty face that hung above his Reichskommissariat, but he did not care.\n\nToday was inevitable, in retrospect. Even without the Americans' denial of gun shipments over to his fiefdom, he would have needed to take a long, straight look at the Reichskommissariat's finances. Today's focus was revamping his secret project. The Americans have thrown it off-course, necessitating a correction; Schenck would not be a good pilot without the benefit of foresight. He had to take some pills for his nerves, however.\n\nHis feet were restless. Schenck realized that he had mountains of work to do; the papers in front of him had waited for years. He heard the aides in the next room, an excellent set of lads, partying while he had to make precise clerical entries. Gritting his teeth, his hands moved slowly. The din was distracting him, and he had to concentrate. Why, he asked himself, were all the mainland Germans so eager to present themselves as savages? It was going to be a long day, as he had to account for the weapons and supplies needed to get the secret project back on track. Schenck only wished for himself some peace and quiet."

If the other Kommissars hear of this, the Führer will have my head and my rank - and you shall have no one to negotiate with.\"\n\n\"Herr Schenck,\" the voice said, attempting a diplomatic tone, \"these are not my terms. Instead, think of it as an exchange.\" Schenck's fingers clacked on the table, and his feet became ever more restless. \"America entered these clandestine talks with the single aim of aiding you. If you are not inclined to give what she needs, within limits, there would be no point in any negotiations. You are reasonable, Herr Schenck. An ace, a war hero. America could not have chosen a better partner.\" The voice paused as if to emphasize its next point. \"What she cannot gain through words, she can gain through force. Remember, Mr. Schenck.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand,\" Schenck said, his leverage taken away from him, leaving him deflated and wheezing, \"However, surely we can negotiate the rates? Twenty-five is too much.\"\n\n\"That's your problem, Herr Schenck. I am not your friend, and, at this stage, neither is America. You either agree, or you don't.

All of these, his guilt, his bleeding conscience, and his crimes could have been averted with a single, resounding \"no.\" In Germania, he was a trophy. In his domain, he is a puppet.\n\nStanding up for a bit of fresh air, he peered at the nearest window. There, the vistas of Südwestafrika beckoned to him, like a siren's call. Yet, he did not hear their songs, nor even their voices. The savannah spread empty, flat in almost all directions. An orange expanse with roads spreading like tattoos on its surface. On those roads, like ants, trucks carried the material produce of his domain, throwing reddish dust and clouding the afternoon light.\n\nSome of those would ferry what the Americans had demanded of him. If the Führer 's cronies discovered that he was shipping German oil to the OFN, he would be dead. A prospect which had brought him to his rarely-used office often lately. He had to prove, using creative accounting, that he was in a trade contract with the South West African Gulf Oil and Aviation Company, a no mean feat. He placed a finger on the window, longing to fly again in the African skies. That was for another day, however.

The oil that flowed through his territory was one of his sources of revenue, not to mention a convenient cover.\n\nHe stared at the phone. \"I understand,\" Lansdale had said, sounding defeated, \"we'll call you at a later date to discuss another avenue of American interests in your domain.\" At the very least, the talks had not broken down right then and there. He sighed, his hands trembling. At least there was a way forward, and that his refusal had not sealed his project's prospects.\n\nHe stood up and peered outside. The vistas of Südwestafrika, his dominion, opened its lips and smiled at him, beckoning him. Schenck felt the desire rise in him, to run in those fields and fly in its skies. However, his countrymen's - and his - hands were stained with blood. Whatever fire that could have burnt in its flat, orange, almost-infinite horizons was now only embers. With whatever he had, he was determined to defend the vestiges of its hope. Whatever he did, his sins would linger, and for that, he left time to heal all the wounds he had caused."

Schenck felt the warmth of the day, carried by the light of the early afternoon. He had left the windows open.\n\nThe Reichskommissar's fingers twisted the receiver's wire. He still felt uneasy. \"Medical equipment, for the most part,\" he said, trying to sound relaxed and laid-back, \"radios, binoculars, backpacks, and rations.\" No guns. \"This shouldn't be too difficult, right, Mr. Lansdale? I did not request weaponry.\"\n\n\"You're right, Herr Schenck.\" Schenck's counterpart sounded calm, almost complacent. \"This is not too much for America, but ultimately, the decision does not lay with me. The President and the Agency would decide whether or not to send whatever you need. You understand my position?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"I'll try to put in a word for you, but only if you let me decide the next topic of discussion: the rich mineral deposits of South West Africa, and how the Company seeks to use it for the greater good.\"\n\nSchenck had little choice. \"Understood.

Schenck had forbidden his men from looking inside: loose lips sunk ships.\n\nOn his desk was a great treasure: American-made war materiel, practically the stuff of dreams. Prying the lid open, he saw what the Americans had sent him. On a bed of hay - to cushion the delivery, he surmised - were a binocular, a first aid kit in a tin box, a compass, and an MRE package. The binoculars arrested his attention immediately. What would it feel like to look at the world through American lenses? He picked it up, scattering strands of hay, and set it onto his eyes.\n\nThrough the windows of his office, the South West seemed an arid, wild land. Closer inspection, however, revealed the beauty of its nature. He saw rodents, lions, wildebeests, and many more, scurrying around, living lives devoid of any conception of sin and redemption. For himself, there was no such hope. Not anymore. He whispered a cold, empty prayer. He could see it plain as day, written on the walls of his office.

Yet, the United States of America used their proxy to utter a single, world-shattering word: 'No.'\n\nHis men had left him with stacks upon stacks of paper. A calculator lay beside the mess, ready to accompany Schenck into yet another session of overwork. All these negotiations had tired him, and he wished he could go a day without worry or anxiety. The medication helped soften his nerves, at least.\n\nHe recognized that this nervousness and anxiety would never go away. Schenck had gone too far, but if weeks of overwork were all it took to redeem himself and his actions, he would accept it, every time. However, as he looked outside, to his favorite panorama in the world, he felt the sun's low, sleepy gaze alert something in him. He had to do his work and do it quickly.

All the paperwork that laid before him was an excuse to let them in. Müller and Hüttig would not suspect a thing. They would perhaps even welcome his overtures to making a more competent and elite land force.

It would not do much in the grand scheme of things, but he would make it as pilots always did - adjust the course of flight to make his destination in time.\n\nTomorrow he would address all his soldiers and hand out medals to the most experienced ones.

Many stones were left unturned. One stone, however, was recently reported to have been hiding quite a valuable military commodity.\n\nA group of adventurous young boys recently took it upon themselves to break into an old, locked-up German warehouse. They discovered not guns nor dusty supplies, but tanks. Parked side-by-side, the Germans must have crammed as many tanks as they could into the warehouse. Easily enough armor to outfit a battalion. It didn't take long before our officials heard of the discovery, and drove down to investigate for themselves. As sure as the sun rises, there it was: a warehouse containing abandoned yet fully outfitted German panzers.\n\nWhilst the models stored within the warehouse are outdated, it will doubtlessly prove to be an immense boon to our forces upon the front lines, should we choose to employ them in the field. Already, the machines are being transported to more secure locations, where they will be prepared for combat use in the near future."

Much to our dismay, they operate from within as well.\n\nLast night, our forces encamped not far from the current front lines came under attack, but not from Zentralafrikan or Ostafrikan forces. The attackers opened fire upon the camp as our soldiers slept. The night sentries were the first to fall, as the guerillas swiftly attempted to commence their slaughter. Men rose abruptly from their sleep, roused by the racket of gunfire. Before many had time to so much as rise from their cots, a barrage of grenades were tossed in their tents. Men in yet untouched tents emerged with their rifles, many without the time to so much as put on a single piece of clothing.\n\nAmidst the explosions and the screams, our men returned fire, killing several and sending the rest running off into the night. Whilst the enemy had been routed, over a dozen Angolan soldiers now lay dead, with many more wounded.\n\nThe fallen attackers wore mostly civilian clothing, with some brandishing ramshackle uniforms. The only common identifying factor between the attackers was a simple swastika arm band. Those still loyal to the Reich appear to have taken up arms against us, a bastardization of our brothers in Ostafrika and Zentralafrika who do the same to earn their freedom, these terrorists fight in hopes of putting us in chains.

He used to admire the Germans and their marble pillars. His mind skipped another beat. The Südwestafrikan flag that sat in front of one of the colonial buildings was cut down by freedom fighters and burned. Abilio recalls how at that moment he felt so inspired, so resolved to bring down the oppressors of his people once and for all.

The thought lingered for a moment as a couple tears streamed down his face, before his thoughts leapt again.\n\nHe recalled all the cold nights at camp. Those long nights he spent maintaining his rifle and thinking of home, and of the horrors he had witnessed in his fighting. He reminded himself of why they fight, and of what horrors his family would endure if people like him did not take up arms for the Angolan cause.\n\nHis memories skipped to closer things, like the attack on camp. The Germans descending upon them from the darkness, expending ammunition into every defenceless Angolan soldier they laid their eyes upon, lobbing grenades at tents full of barely awoken men. He recalled his proudest moment, where he boldly emerged from his bunk, rifle in hand, and returned fire upon the assailants as his comrades scrambled to retreat. Would his family be proud of him? Would the Angolan people be proud? His thoughts returned to the present. Of course they would take pride in him, he was assured. So long as they fought on with a sense of sacrifice, his people would be free. And Abilio had made his sacrifice. His thoughts became a blur, as his head felt dizzy. It was time for him to rest."

His people will learn that, on this tragic day, German history's greatest man has died.\n\nIts greatest man indeed: a failed painter turned architect of a crumbling empire. The Führer's Thousand Year Reich, won in blood, now ran on the back of corrupt opportunists, cruel fanatics and, most importantly, spineless bureaucrats. Germany was rotting from the inside, and Reichskommissar Schenck knew that, shorn of its main pillar, the Reich will cave in on itself. He might have wept for those caught in the coming chaos once. Now, after the chaos it has exported abroad? The Reich will only reap what it has sown for two decades.\n\nThis collapse will no doubt spread to Africa. Even as the Reichskommissar droned his well rehearsed eulogy, his mind wandered. All three of the Reich's Afrikan colonies were powderkegs. Any embers drifting in the wind will set off one disaster after another. At the very least, the coming trouble will surely clip the Afrikaner Luftwaffe's wings. Inwardly, Schenck relished the thought of ending at least one source of pointless bloodshed. Anything to ease his burden, relieve him of a crisis he was incapable of fixing himself.\n\n\"The Führer always taught the German people that the toughest trials can only be overcome by the strongest men. As vanguards of the Aryan race in Africa, we must hold our people's civilizing torch over the Dark Continent in his stead.\"\n\nSo did Schenck end his speech. A technician cut the microphone.

The Ostafrikan had been insistent that the deteriorating situation necessitated some military cooperation, that all proud Germans in Africa should close ranks together to forestall the civil strife that had befallen Germany. Less charitably, he commented on the Südwestafrikan's faint hint of hesitation; he asked, likely in a deadpan tone, if the man had anything to hide from his colleagues. Ostafrika, contrarily, held no compunctions in operating on what is merely another piece of the Reich's Lebensraum - especially on matters of regional security.\n\nIn other words: Hüttig had trapped Schenck to a corner. Müller's thoughts Schenck can only guess, but he also acquiesced to Hüttig demands.\n\nAn hour had come and gone before Schenck signed everything Hüttig required. The former aviator looked at the window, from which the waning sun cast its crimson light throughout the office. How much the Reichskommissar would prefer to be away, flying in the sky.

The hour was late, yet he had no desire to leave, without the will to carry himself away.\n\nFumbling as he uncorked a bottle of whiskey, he pressed the bottle to his lips and downed as much of the toxic liquid as he could. Breaking to cough as his throat burned, Schenck placed the bottle back down onto his desk, alongside the other empty bottles.\n\nHe needed to forget. Why would God not let him forget? Schenck lingered upon the thought as he swallowed another swig of whiskey, only to hack out another series of coughs. What would it take to forget?\n\nHe ruminated over the atrocities he had signed off on over the course of his career. Decent people, men, women, and even children, unable to escape the fuses of his bombs, or the barrels of his troops' rifles. He wondered if it would make any difference if they knew he did not wish for any of it.\n\nSchenck took another burning sip of his drink, tears now rolling freely down his face. No, he thought to himself, this wasn't his fault. He never wished for any of this. None of the horrors in Africa were of his volition. They were all orders from Germania. One after another the orders flood in, mandating atrocities, ruining lives, killing thousands.\n\nWolfgang Schenck could not live with himself one day further if he continued following orders as he did.

His head began throbbing. He could not run away this time. The Angolan Plan was the only way out, because no matter how high he flew, his conscience would be there. He prayed that if Angola were not to become a great nation, then it would at least be strong enough to stand against their oppressors, who would no doubt come back if they had the chance - German or otherwise. It meant a nation with water and sanitation, with jobs and income. It also meant a country that could fight, on the land and in the air.\n\nNo doubt the other Reichskommissars would be suspicious if he made any moves to execute the plan. Müller, as distracted as he was, would be suspicious of him using any materials not used directly for the war effort. Hüttig would be worse: any men kept in reserve would surely enrage him and the man was already paranoid to begin with. Schenck wondered if a free nation in the midst of this foolish war were even possible. Throughout history, there were many men more capable and more intelligent than he who could not achieve these very dreams. But he had to try. There was no other choice."

He shuddered at the thought of someone finding these papers and snitching to Germany, or even worse, someone like Hüttig. God knows there were too many Hüttigs in this world. Even more tempting, however, was to soar again in the clouds - but that merely delayed the work that needed to be done.\n\nHe sighed. What was all this for anyways? A free Angola was so far away. So many maladies bedevilled the country: the poor infrastructure, the unruly fighting men, the complete absence of any proper industry. These all needed to be fixed before Angola could even have a chance at mere freedom, let alone prosperity.\n\nSchenck closed his eyes and tried to imagine the Angola he wished to leave behind. Hopefully, when all this was said and done, as his plane would take off from these dusty airfields for the last time, he would leave behind a place which echoed the best of what was beating in the heart of every person. It would be a place where a simple man could provide an honest living for his family. A place where the children could run around in parks with their friends. A place where the wicked man would get justice, fair and promptly. Finally, he dreamt that this new Angola would become a place which would bow to no one except for Father Time - but only barely."

And the German Civil War would not last forever; should the victor intervene in this blasted war, then there would be double the scrutiny. Anything they did would need to be covered up and fast. Schenck furrowed his brow. He knew some men who could be trusted to handle the more sensitive parts of the plan.\n\nAnd how suspicious would Müller get? He would mostly be distracted by the war, but Afrika-Schild would permit Müller access to Südwestafrika. If he realized that supplies were used to merely \"stabilize\" Angola, he might get suspicious that we aren't trying our best to win the war.\n\nIf too many resources were reallocated too quickly, Müller would no doubt act on his suspicions and put an end to Schenck's plan for good. Conversely, if too few resources were allocated, then a liberated Angola would crumble when the Germans, or even the Americans, decided to assert themselves."

Unfortunately, there was the problem of the war: military factories were busy churning out guns, planes, ammo, and everything else for the war effort. Civilian industries were at capacity trying to maintain the facade of normality, on top of repairing the infrastructure damage caused either by American bombers or insurgent bombings in the countryside.\n\nThere were no easy solutions, Schenck mused. The factories had to supply the war to keep the Americans from overrunning Angola, but without a post-war industry capable of supplying the natives in their post-war struggle for freedom, the Angolan Plan would be doomed from the start. Perhaps there was a compromise that could benefit both of Schenck's objectives...while risking failure at both."

But for the Angolan Plan to succeed, that would have to change.\n\nWe could invest generously into improving the standard of living, committing ourselves to civil development to the point that even the poorest Angolan will know the wonders of modern plumbing, but it will make Müller suspicious as we divert more of his raw materials for non-military purposes.\n\nThese plans are, of course, expensive - both in terms of resources and the political cost of getting Zentralafrika to look the other way. Needless to say, it was a bad time to be diverting wartime necessities for civilian utilities.\n\nSchenck sighed. Any major infrastructure push would no doubt raise suspicions from Müller. Yet, at the same time, he had to give the natives something to fight for - a semblance of prosperity and a headstart for the natives after so many years of oppression. That, and the hope of minimizing the crushing regret that he did not do everything possible, when this was over."

It would be an overstatement to say that they were competent fighters, and for their own good, this could not continue.\n\nSchenck dusted off plans to dispatch some of the garrison to remote villages - not as a garrison, but as a 'nativizing' training force, quietly preparing them for the day they would stand alone. Perhaps they would not have the most advanced weapons, but they would not need them if he trained them right. They would fight dirty, with guerilla tactics and unconventional strategies, bleeding their many enemies dry, whether they be American or German.\n\nThis would not go unnoticed. Hüttig, in particular, would be more than annoyed: his suspicions would be piqued. If the men are not ferried towards the frontline, he might question what, exactly, is so pressing on the Südwestafrikan home front to demand so many troops. Schenck shuddered. For a moment, he wondered if Hüttig already knew what was going on in these rooms from some rat or erstwhile spy.\n\nFor now, Hüttig had his hands full with the war, but Schenck knew he couldn't push his luck; the madman could make a move before the war is over, and the failure of Schenck's plans would leave Angola in a worse place than when he arrived."

His plans are moving quickly towards completion; now all he needs is to allow the independence movements to take control of the territory in a final push, but for that, they need time and space to gather the men, and roads and factories to move and supply them.\n\nTo address this fundamental issue, his mind already has a solution: he will order the garrison to stop protecting the villages from the rebels, and stop the patrols that regularly keep vigil over the roads and highways. This way, the rebels will slowly take over, and extend their control over Angola. As soon as that happens, more and more will join the freedom fighters, further strengthening their cause.\n\nHowever, this option is not free from risk. The other Reichskommissars will surely notice the empty garrisons and unguarded roads, and this will greatly increase their suspicions about our conduct: if he truly is to make this move, he'll need to be prepared for everything, even - no, especially - for the worst.\n\nThe choices are straightforward: move fast, move carefully, or try to find a balance between the two.

Unity, or liberty? Schenck's decision tonight could set the precedent for all the other leaders in Afrika to follow.

Alternatively, Schenck's men could do the majority of the work, while briefing some hardy ex-revolutionaries in their cells, telling them to stick to the plan.

Any option taken would need to account for how much suspicion it would raise from Hüttig. There would need to be new names in the prison rolls, new identities for the released prisoners, but time was of the essence. The more prisoners that would be freed, the more difficult it would become to release them all unnoticed.\n\nSome would have to be released, no matter the cost: they had essential skills and education that would be vital to the new government.

If such a dilemma was supposed to make him feel better, it didn't. It was one more thing to hide from Müller, who would surely start asking questions when faced with such disorganized orders.\n\nThere wasn't much left to do now - most of the preparations for the Angolan Plan were finished, and Schenck could just tell his men to pull out of the villages immediately.

However, reports have flooded in, saying foreign troops marched inside, and within in a matter of hours, secured it. While our great leader Jonas Savimbi and his officials were evacuated shortly before the occupation, losing the city meant we we've lost our main facilities and means of equipment production. This means our forces will slowly be drained until they are nothing more than simply men. No matter how loyal and brave men are, they cannot compensate for the superior troops of the enemy; and without centralized command, the resistance will fizzle out into nothing more than several separated partisan cells, which will be easily hunted down and destroyed. It seems all hope for victory is lost, and that we must pray that our foes offer us some dignity, even in defeat.\n\nDespite this, we have done our best.

The burgeoning air force of the nation is his sole focus, as evident to anyone who ever looked over the Angolan horizon. His planes rule the sub-Saharan skies.\n\nOver the years, Schenck has ensured that Südwestafrika is the air hub of German Afrika. In other internal matters, he is known for his leniency and the close camaraderie he shares with fellow Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller, who he often attends safaris with in his personal helicopters or joining in the hunt.

Most prominent analysis of the war saw the MPLA as unlikely to succeed - their success is a statement of the MPLA's campaign of unconventional warfare, and to failures within Savimbi's forces.\n\nNo longer trapped in perpetual conflict, Neto has begun a litany of plans to repair the broken nation. Tokyo has already congratulated Neto for his victory, declaring him a \"liberator of the African people.\" For his part, Neto has wasted no time in installing a popular republic, one reliant on Japanese aid and support. It seems for the present, the two have become closely intertwined - Japan may at last have its foothold over Africa."

 ANG_PW.10.d:0 "Angola was a depressing experience, yet each day he got up and kept pressing forward. War correspondents didn't get sent expecting comfort - the places he stayed was proof. Dirty shacks with infrequent running water was roughly the standard. Fortunately he didn't spend much time in them.\n\nHis work was out in the villages and towns, speaking to the people and soldiers living through this war. He remained struck by the devastation that touched everything, throughout the country. Even the richest towns had an undercurrent of uneasiness, fear, and weariness. No matter where he traveled, how many soldiers he spoke to regardless of side, this feeling of devastation; a country that had only just been starting to recover, persisted.\n\nHe had his limits. He didn't wander into ongoing fights. His PRESS badge wouldn't protect him there, though gunfire was a common occurrence, and he'd definitely been shot at more than once. The longer he stayed here, the more he struggled to capture the magnitude, horror, weariness, and importance of the wars that were consuming not just Angola, but the entire continent. Nothing seemed to properly capture this, and so he kept working.\n\nToday he was wandering the remains of a skirmish. Broken barricades, destroyed guns and equipment, and even some burned-out tanks and transports were strewn around the battlefield. He even saw the bodies from both sides sprawled on the ground, forgotten, abandoned, and rotting.\n\nA sound made him start, as he realized he wasn't alone. He spun to the noise, and his heartbeat slowly relaxed as he saw it was only a child. A boy that couldn't have been more than thirteen, dressed in ragged clothes, and little more than skin and bones. He didn't seem to be paying attention to him, instead trying to scour the remains of a tank for scrap to sell. Almost of its own accord, Matthew raised his camera, and snapped a picture."

 ANG_PW.11.d:0 "If this was the face of the enemy, Issac thought, then he wouldn't have ever enlisted in the United States' Armed Forces. This was a jovial, happy face, one that indulged in alcohol from time to time, but that seemed to be its biggest vice. The thought never crossed Issac's mind that this man could have been a soldier in the Free Angolan Army.\n\nThe man was native in Chokwe, but over time had learnt enough Portuguese to be able to communicate with it, which was fortunate for Issac. Isaac's ability to speak the language was a major boost to his application to join the volunteer force in the first place, but now it served as a telephone line between two vastly different cultures. They met well, as Issac was in severe need of somebody to drink with, and Adrien knew nobody that spoke either Chokwe or Portuguese.\n\nBetween drinks Issac talked about his hometown in New Orleans. Adrien, the name of Issac's drinking buddy, was interested in the intense mingling of culture that had made the city famous in both America, and now, it seemed, Angola. Adrien shared anecdotes from his time as a professional fisherman, which turned out to be less anecdotes and more fishing tips for the next time Issac was travelling down Lungué-Bungo.\n\nAs time went by, their conversations gradually shifted to the war. Both men were careful not to reveal their true professions as soldiers, but they spoke optimistically about the end of the conflict. Adrien spoke sorrowfully about the war, wishing an end to the conflict and a peaceful homeland for his people, a universal value so it seemed to Issac.\n\nIt grew late into the night when Adrien departed. Shouting had erupted from outside the bar, and the sounds of trucks grew louder and louder. Adrien understood the sounds well enough; his joyful expression had turned grim, but before he departed the establishment, he made a promise to Issac to once again meet at the same bar they were standing in right now. As the door to the bar slammed shut, Isaac truly wondered if he would be able to return to this place before the end of his deployment."

 ANG_PW.12.d:0 "Checking his bag, Will triple-checked that he had everything he'd needed for the interview. While he'd never thought himself of much as a reporter- photography was more his forte, but when the US government offers you the opportunity to interview an ally out of Angola, you don't refuse. Standing on the helipad, his shoulder-long brown hair blew in the wind of the descending Huey bearing the focus of Will's trip. As it descended in front of him, Jonas Savimbi jumped out of the passenger seat, wearing his iconic beret, camouflaged uniform, and khaki slacks, he seemed like something out of a TV action flick. The burly monster of a man smiled through his bushy beard, and moved his mouth, though Will couldn't hear any words, thanks to the whirring helicopter behind him. \"What?!\" Jonas cuffed his hands together and yelled into the face of the journalist. \"I take it your ears aren't shattered?!\" The pair shared a smile.\n\nDriving through the city bearing nothing short of a thousand guards, Will was getting the grand tour. \"And there would be the arms depot- you're not a spy, are you?\" Savimbi flashed a smile, hardly caught out of the corner of Will's eye as he snapped a picture of the warehouse. \"Heh, no, of course not. Now, you've said that the bombing raids against the Socialists have been something of a point of contention in the high command?\" Savimbi scoffed, then let out a sigh. \"Some of my subordinates call it 'inhumane'. They don't know that this is the best way forward for Angola, even with a few more craters. They don't know what is best, and I do.\" Will felt as though he was getting a better idea of Savimbi than Jonas knew. Looking at his notes, Will looked back to Savimbi. \"Before the German occupation lifted, you said that you'd do whatever it took to liberate your people from the German menace. Since the civil war, however, you have received aid with open arms from German sources.\" Will looked to Savimbi, as his subject of interrogation slowly turned his head to him. What Will saw was not a look of anger, however. The closest which he could compare it to was his father when recounting stories of his youth. Nostalgic. Smiling, he looked to Will."

 ANG_PW.20.d:0 "Angola. A land of humidity, jungles, mud, and death. A nation of little importance, which was barely industrialized, and that held nothing but the bitter wounds and consequences of Nazism.\n\nYet he was here all the same. A Japanese commander in Angola, assisting the MPLA against the OFN-backed UNITA. He looked out the window in his small office, as children played with a ball below, and released a resigned sigh. What was he even doing here? What was even the point of this escapade? Spreading the liberation of Pan-Asianism? In Africa? Angola was well beyond where the Co-Prosperity Sphere was supposed to end.\n\nThere had been a time where he'd believed in the cause and mission, where he'd been proud knowing that they were better than the imperialists who had enslaved and exploited Asia for so long.\n\nNow though? He found this entire situation uncomfortable. Wrong. Japan had as much right to involve itself in Africa as the OFN did - which was in short, none whatsoever. How, exactly, were they supposed to claim to be better than the Germans and Americans when they engaged in the same imperial tactics? The politicians sold it as spreading 'liberation' and 'protection' from the 'evil west' - the exact same excuses the OFN and Nazis also used. He found them just as unconvincing, no matter if they came from Tokyo or Washington.\n\nIn the end, it all came down to a desire for power. Principles didn't matter when there was opportunity to spite the United States. He shook his head as he watched the children play. They were so carefree, and reminded him of his younger brother, and the times where they had feared the retaliation by the Americans after Hawaii. Japan might no longer need to fear America, but Angola was not so fortunate. Perhaps there was no reason to be here, but maybe he could at least ensure that something good came out of it regardless."

 ANG_PW.21.d:0 "Imada Harukichi, a journalist for the Mainichi Shimbun on assignment somewhere in Angola, found himself fairly impressed with the man he was interviewing. The man was Agostinho Neto; the venue was a fast motorboat on a river. The leader of the MPLA, far from being the bombastic Chō Hi that Imada would have expected, was instead a personable man of a moderate temperament. He treated Imada with courteous respect and asked polite questions about the journalist, his home, his newspaper and his family.\n\nAs the interview went on, Imada noticed one thing about Neto: the man was stubborn to a fault. Whenever Imada brought up the MPLA, Neto would narrow or roll his eyes and say things like \"their ideas are at last misguided and at worst a prostration before American or German imperialism\". After the second such attempt, Imada gave up, and changed the subject, only to be interrupted by Neto, who had ordered the boat stopped.\n\n\"Senhor Imada, I beg your pardon, but can you tell me what you see?\" Neto was pointing at a village by the far bank of the river. Imada looked and said that he saw a village. Neto sorrowfully shook his head.\n\n\"You're right, but I don't just see that. I see destitute, hungry people, ruined by the imperialist manipulation of the masses. No riches, no pride in their own culture, no pan-Africanism, no nothing. That there, Senhor Imada, is what I fight for. To find a way to put an end to that sight. To give these people a chance for happier times, a happier life.\""

Loading into a taxi, Hayao made for the shoreline.\n\nThe sun sunk behind the high-rise districts of the developing Chinese city, casting long shadows along the ocean's surface.

I've been told that this field in particular has a vast reservoir of diamonds about 750 meters underground.\"\n\n\"That's right, untapped riches.\" The one on the right replied, his unflawed Japanese thoroughly surprising Hayao. \"731 meters to be exact, and they've been located in various portions in the right of the field.\" The one of the left added, in similarly well punctuated Japanese. \"But this field is one of many, and we are not here to merely discuss this particular set of diamonds. Your nation wants its mining firms all over Angola.\"\n\n\"Correct. Diamonds are definitely going to be a large subsect of our endeavours, but iron ore as well as granite is a top priority. I've read up on reports... most say that while the resources are here, they are usually untapped.\"\n\n\"That's right. We would be willing to sign onto almost any mining site, as long as we can maintain a few overseers over each sight. Plus a share of the profits, but that part was to be hashed out in the negotiations.\" The right hand Angolan feigned shock, and looked around the site in fake amazement, locking eyes back with Hayao after a few seconds. \"Which appears to be happening right now.\"\n\nQuelling a laugh, Hayao thought for a moment. He was warned that the Angolans would've required a share of the profits.
