In the past couple of weeks, one such abnormal arrangement between the Axencia Anti-Separatista and the American Central Intelligence Agency has taken shape, initiated by the Americans nonetheless!\n\nThey have provided vast amounts of intelligence that they have gathered regarding some of the most persistent and dangerous underground groups in Iberia, including the CNT-FAI and FSLP, including providing the locations of safe houses and weapons caches that they have gathered. This information, correlated with our own, is allowing the AAS to begin planning operations and raids to further cripple the separatists and socialist groups that would seek to destroy Iberia.\n\nOf course, the United States would never publicly acknowledge that they would sacrifice those \"fighting for freedom\" to authoritarian states, and Iberia would, of course, never recognize that they needed the help of Americans to root out dissent.

Membership lists, weapons storage locations, safe houses, recruitment efforts and even fully detailed plans are now in our hands, which will make targeting and crushing the many organizations seeking to destroy Iberia much, much easier.\n\nWe would never admit to needing the help, but it's unquestioned that the CIA has much more advanced technology and resources at their disposal than anything that we could provide our own agencies.

It may keep the ordinary citizen fed and clothed right now, so for now we have to tolerate the black market's existence for now since we are still trying to repair and reform the whole system.\n\nThat doesn't mean we can't keep an eye on it, and our agents in the police that are doing such have reported a disturbing trend lately. Along with fresh vegetables and unrationed meat, there is an increased amount of uncensored literature, pamphlets and assorted media that is being distributed by these underground capitalists, which they appear to be selling for rather low prices, or even slipping into otherwise innocuous packages. They are denouncing our reform efforts, calling into question Speer's beliefs, and other such hogwash, undermining their faith in the new National Socialist system.\n\nUnfortunately, there is little that we can do right now.

Some include those that Speer's advisors and supporters have called for that a majority of the nation is at best lukewarm too. But some of the pamphlets are calling for such crazy ideas as free, multi-candidate elections and even reducing the Führer's power!\n\nThere is no doubt that some foreign power is behind this, most likely the Americans with their silly ideas of democracy, or perhaps the Japanese or Italians trying to take advantage of our weakened state. However, the Reich is in little position to actually combat this growing tide of foreign backed destabilization, so all we can do is manage it, and hope our reform efforts will convince the ordinary Germans that we know what we are doing."

While most of these groups are small, disunited in aims, and spread over a vast area, they have all seen a massive boost in organizational activity and resources that seems rather sudden and surprising.\n\nUndoubtedly, this is the work of a foreign power, using their secret service to fund our opponents to undermine our power and strength. But despite our efforts, we haven't been able to trace the source of the funds and support they are receiving. After all, we still have a Reich to rebuild!\n\nWe can deal with some posters and pamphlets for now, but we will have to keep a close eye on the people, for if too many are swayed and misled, it could spell trouble."

Small town mayors, minor party officials, government bureaucrats, local military heros and many others have had a deluge of criminal charges thrown at them in unsubstantiated pamphlets and word of mouth.\n\nScandalous stories of corruption, charges of fraud, even accusations of murder, are running rampant through the populace. Even more concerning isn't the popular opinion, but those that these salacious rumors are targeting: lower level National Socialist functionaries that are at best wary of Speer's reforms, and at worse actively opposed to them. How many of these rumors and accusations are true is unknown: some most likely are, though many more will have been fabricated whole cloth, but will be difficult to disprove nevertheless.\n\nOn one hand, this can be helpful to get some reforms passed. If our reactionary opponents are so busy defending themselves in the court of public opinion, they won't have the time or energy to stop those that want to reform the Reich. On the other hand, the fact that we can't find the source of these rumors means we should be wary: our unseen allies of reform today can become our worst enemies tomorrow."

For weeks, undercover police officers have been reporting on a flood of pro-reformist literature and media, uncensored by the Propagandaministerium, advocating for policies and ideas that even the most strident Speerites would consider a step too far.\n\nLocal authorities and the Orpo have managed to crack down on the most destabilizing and blatant of these pro-reformist and destabilizing pamphlets and flyers, but it can only be a fraction of what is actually distributed.

However, that doesn't mean plainclothes, undercover police officers can't investigate and infiltrate these movements, and their reports are increasingly worrying.\n\nSomehow, these disparate groups are receiving funds and resources that these students shouldn't have in their possession, which is allowing them to expand their efforts outside of university campuses and technical college classrooms. Even more disturbing is the reports that groups like the Reichsbanner are also receiving such resources, allowing these more radical groups to grow in strength.\n\nWhile we've been able to track, confiscate and seize some of the funds that investigators can prove are illegal, it's clear that some foreign power is putting a lot of time and energy in bolstering the pro-democracy and anti-National Socialist movements in Europe."

A dozen civil servants in the reparation program have been accused of corruption, kickbacks and other measures, despite previously stellar records.

That is just one of the many reasons why we are now trying to wind it down.\n\nOur efforts to end the slave system while also keeping our economy going has not been easy, and reports of an increasing number of breakdowns of vehicles and factories all over the eastern territories has raised concern that this isn't just lazy or incomptent slaves like usual.

 USA_CIA_RUS.11.desc:0 "Langley, Virginia. Somewhere deep within the labyrinthic headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency, a mid-level office grunt named John was tasked with composing a detailed list of military equipment to be sent to a certain OFN-friendly nation state in Russia. Like any other CIA member, he conducted the task most diligently, laying out a number of possible options and contemplating the possible risks of benefits of each.\n\nThe simplest and most obvious option would be basic infantry equipment, of course. The clear superiority of mass-produced modern equipment over whatever scraps the local warlords can come up with would undoubtedly be a decisive factor in the upcoming conflicts, but Russia must be already overflowing with rifles and other assorted infantry equipment - would that marginal improvement really be worth it?\n\nAnother option would be sending a large quantity of motor vehicles. History proves that mobility is one of the most essential tools of warfare, with even Russia itself failing to counter the rapid advance of lightning-fast motorized forces. American vehicles could be spearheading a rapid push to encircle large enemy formations, but they could also be misused in front assaults against well-entrenched enemies. Could the Russian commanders be trusted to properly use these powerful tools?\n\nLastly, John thought of going as far as to send them helicopters and jets. It'd be an incredibly risky move, but the potential payoff would be huge - if they could figure out how to maintain, fuel, and pilot these machines, they'd be completely unstoppable in the skies for the foreseeable future. That \"if\" is a massive \"if\", however. Even the slightest amount of carelessness or incompetence would rapidly turn these fine tuned machines into useless piles of scrap, and John wasn't sure if that kind of expertise still existed in the wastes of Russia.\n\nIt took a while of crunching numbers and contemplating the strategic implications of the options, but eventually, he came to a decision. The first delivery was set to be dispatched in a few days, containing vast numbers of..."

Several arrests of lower ranking dissenters have occurred over the last few weeks, though many within the Party itself are largely immune to such action.\n\nIt is unclear what exactly is causing them to feel so comfortable speaking out, and allowing them to organize so freely.

The Maudling government of the United England Party, one of the splinter factions from the original collaborationist Royal Party, has taken power and pursued OFN membership.\n\nDespite Reginald Maudling being the nominal Prime Minister, analysts report that real power is held by Harold Macmillan, previously a reform-advocate in the Royal Party. His shadow leadership makes ascertaining England's new direction difficult. Although he was known for his pro-democracy leanings before the war, it is still unclear why he opposed HMMLR during the conflict. Nonetheless, our analysts believe that he still favors increased democratic reform in England, and further believe that a pro-OFN faction within his party, possibly led by the liberal minister Selwyn Lloyd, has won Macmillan's favor. This is likely the cause of their new international alignment.\n\nConcern has been raised about the security risks involved in accepting England as an ally, given militarist Anthony Kershaw's position in the Cabinet. Kershaw has not been deemed openly hostile to OFN interests, but he has been ascertained to be a loyalty-risk. He has no inherent objection to remaining in the Pakt except that it forces England into a subservient position, something which might not be the case under a reformist leaning Reich. He and his faction seem to prioritize combatting Thatcher's Royal Party and Chesterton's National Front over staying out of the OFN, but he cannot be counted on as a permanent US ally. Ultimately, Kershaw is loyal to Macmillan above all else, and we cannot know Macmillan's outlook with certainty.\n\nAnalysts recommend acceptance of England in the OFN, but urge caution. Macmillan's government has served our interests, but his party's loyalty cannot be guaranteed. Close monitoring of English political developments will be necessary, particularly in the event of Maudling usurping control of the party from Macmillan, but England could still prove a valuable asset to the OFN."

The Agency would neither wish to hinder a future friend nor aid a future enemy, and until Thatcher's political allegiance is made law it would be inadvisable to covertly aid or attack her regime.

Consequently, I approached Colonel Standish, appealing to his sense of national pride. Standish claimed he has never believed in the reconstruction efforts currently in progress but was ambivalent towards notion of overthrowing government. Made it perfectly clear to Standish that he'll have full support in his obstruction of the government and eventual overthrow. Standish agreed shortly thereafter.\n\nOver following week, I was introduced to several officers who feel as Standish does. All are willing to join in, provided our support is concrete and of the material variety. I formally request a demonstration of our support in the form of *REDACTED* to be shipped to Liverpool on the *REDACTED* day of next month.

Matthew Whelan, Horace Fuller, Frederick Price, Harold St. John, and Lewis Weaver were strong advocates of a reconstruction effort that would rebuild a portion of London's sewer system that collapsed during the war. During a session in Parliament last month, they abruptly changed their votes and reclassified the motion as a waste of time and resources. Later, London Police were approached by an individual (whose name has not been disclosed to the EBC) who informed them that these MPs had taken a bribe from an agent of Germany enticing them to prevent the reconstruction effort from succeeding. The informant provided photographic evidence of several meetings between the MPs in question and a party MI5 has identified as a known espionage agent. An arraignment date has not yet been set, and it is not expected the MPs will be tried individually. The EBC made an attempt to interview the informant who broke the story but MI5, we are told, has lost track of this person.

For a while it had seemed like Justine would never get The Sun off the drawing board, until a strange man had approached her with money, and plenty of it. He said he wanted to help her, and by extension, help Thatcher. Justine had been suspicious initially, but the money was good and soon the doors to The Sun opened and writers came pouring in to work for her. Already she'd received numerous letters of encouragement from people in office.\n\nYes, Justine was doing well, and in her view, there was no limit to how far she could take The Sun. Careers were hers to make or break..."

As the horribly-butchered song came to a sonorous end, Thatcher couldn't help but applaud the efforts of the brave lads. Beside her, her husband Denis did the same, albeit awkwardly as he was holding a tumbler of whiskey. \"Is this enough to change your mind about accepting their offer, darling?\" he asked Margaret.\n\nThatcher chuckled and shook her head. \"Not a chance.\" The motley Chicagoans, despite their antics, were really a keen-minded crew who'd helped shape America's economic policy. Now, pockets bursting, they'd crossed the oceans and offered their money and support to Thatcher. Their reason: they sought a more stable England for doing business with and believed Thatcher could deliver it. On the surface, there were no snags, but at this party hosted at Margaret's estate, the Iron Lady happened to notice the Chicagoans were not quite as drunk as they appeared.\n\nIf this was a performance intended to put her off her guard, it was well-done, but Thatcher was never off her guard. This gift of funds and support might be a Trojan horse, but she knew how to deal with it if it was.\n\nThe trick was to have a torch to hand to set fire to the horse the instant it began to open its mouth. For now, however, she would accept this gift for what it was: a tool to make her more powerful than ever before..."

Subservience to the Americans was just as bad as to the Germans, and the economic collapse had shown just how bad indeed that had been. He had been one of the votes McShane was most certain of. But now, in McShane's office, he seemed to have changed his tune.\n\n\"I've taken a closer look at what the United States have done for Canada and Australia,\" O'Connelly remarked, fidgeting with his shiny new watch as if he was entirely too anxious for the meeting to be over. He leaned in, his voice quieter. \"Listen, Tommy. It's better the Yanks than the Germans or the Brits, and without someone keeping us afloat, it'll be the Germans or Brits who scoop us back up. We might as well try something new, eh?\"\n\nWhen no immediate response was given, O'Connelly clapped the stunned McShane on the back and briskly fled the office. He mumbled something about how he needed to meet the missus for dinner, but McShane was barely paying attention. O'Connelly was only the most recent in a long line of defections to Lemass, and not a single one could be explained. Had McShane missed something?\n\nAs he remained quietly in thought, a noise floated through the open window. O'Connelly was starting his car, preparing to go home for the day. As McShane watched the older man struggle with his keys, a thought struck him. Hadn't that car been red just the other day?"

Poe was doubtful. \"This can't be the guy we're looking for. Looks like some random idiot wandering, or worse yet some kind of informant. \"The sergeant of the infantrymen nodded his agreement. \"We can open fire, Agent Poe, if you give the order.\"\n\nPoe nodded. As he was about to give the order, Donlon put a hand on his shoulder to stop him. \"No, don't do that, Agent Poe. Look through the binoculars. You'll see it's one of ours - the USFIPs to be exact.\"\n\nPoe nodded and looked through and was shocked at what he saw. A worn but unbroken face, with eyes still bright, attached to a man in well-maintained but very clearly old-model uniform from the Second World War. \"You're right, Donlon, it's one of ours. At ease, soldiers. We've met friends.\"\n\nAs the troopers lowered their arms, Donlon and Poe cautiously walked to the man holding the lantern. The man seemed to be repressing strong emotion at the sight of the Americans. When they reached him and shook hands, the man, who ID'd himself as Colonel Russell W.

Sometimes they got into cringe-inducing slap fights over the matter that attracted eclectic crowds of amused onlookers ranging from the imam and the muezzin to the harbormaster and the librarian. The local policemen had to be shaken awake and often showed up thirty seconds after everything had calmed down.\n\nNo wonder, then, that nobody wised up to what was actually being discussed. In fact, this \"chat\" was a preplanned secret communication between a CIA agent and a contact operating on behalf of the Indonesian resistance.
