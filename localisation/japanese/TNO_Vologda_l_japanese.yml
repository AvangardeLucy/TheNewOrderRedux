 POLITICS_VASILY_IVANOV_DESC: "ヴァシーリー・ニコラエヴィチ・イヴァノフは地方の靴屋の子として生まれ、1920年代に入って赤軍に徴兵された。その後士官学校への入学を許され、順当な昇進を重ね、ドイツ軍が侵攻してきた時点で大佐にまで出世していた。彼と指揮下の旅団は絶望的なモスクワ防衛戦を戦い抜いたが、ドイツ軍がモジャイスク防衛戦を突破した際、比較的規律を保ちつつ撤退を行なった。他の兵士と違い、彼らの部隊は北方へと向かい、最終的にエゴロフ元帥の率いる部隊に合流した。西ロシア革命戦線内で大将にまで昇進したイヴァノフは、ドイツに対する反抗作戦の一端を担うこととなった。\n\nしかし、その勢いは長くは続かなかった。革命戦線は裏切りと内部権力闘争によって弱体化し、そのためにドイツ軍と協力者に対する隙を与えてしまった。故郷ヴォログダを手中に収めていることを確認したイヴァノフは革命戦線の大義を捨てるという重い決断を下し、指揮下の軍を率いて分離し中立を宣言した。これ以上瓦解しかけの革命戦線に関わって血が流れていくのを見たくはなかったのだ。\n\nイヴァノフはこの行動によってヴォログダの人々にナチの暴虐からの街を解放した英雄、他の軍閥によってもたらされる混沌からの防波堤だとみなされ、信頼を得た。また、この国家は革命戦線とモスコーヴィエン国家弁務官区の両方から有用な緩衝国家として事実上その存在を許されている。ここ数年、この武装中立は抑止力としては良い働きをしているが、他の軍閥によって試練がもたらされるのも時間の問題である。"
 POLITICS_PAVEL_BELYAYEV_DESC: "During the Great Patriotic War, during the Moscow evacuation, Pavel Ivanovich Belyayev was a nobody; a flight school cadet, not someone one should fear. During the West Russian War, he rose to prominence as one of Ivanov's most capable pilots, eventually cementing for himself a place among his closest advisors. When Ivanov founded the State of Vologda, Pavel stood beside him all the while, a godfather to a newly christened government. During this early period, he served Ivanov faithfully, pledging to be above politics and to continue advising the founder as capable as he could.\n\nPavel would break this promise only a few years into the founding, partially out of fear of being rendered irrelevant, and partly out of his disappointment at the State's indecision. He was elected into the People's Assembly, the legislative body of Vologda. No one, at least not publicly, doubted his loyalty to Ivanov. However, in the chamber itself, he had become increasingly critical of Ivanov's almost-pacifistic conception of Vologda as being a \"neutral zone\" for all Russians. He joined the Militarists, and, owing to his prestige as a godfather of the State, he climbed the rungs of their hierarchy, emerging as their head.\n\nNow, as the leader of the Militarists, he advocates for something radically different from the other parliamentary factions. He regards their policy of \"neutrality\" and \"liberal democracy\" as being stumbling blocks that will set the State tumbling down. Instead, he passionately argues for irredentism. To him, war and force is the safest guarantee for Vologda, but not everyone is as sure."
 POLITICS_ANATOLY_DRYGIN_DESC: "Anatoly Semenovich Drygin is a divisive figure in Vologda. To his supporters, he is a rare human face in the military, a true believer in democracy and in safeguarding the statelet's ordinary people. To his opponents, he is a naive dreamer with no answers to Vologda's pressing security questions. One thing nobody can dispute, however, is that Drygin has always fought nobly for what he sees as right.\n\nBorn into a large peasant family in Saratov, Drygin initially studied agronomy and became an expert in berry cultivation (a hobby he still indulges in his free time), but was drafted into the Red Army when the Germans began their invasion, continuing to fight for the West Russian Revolutionary Front after the Soviet Union collapsed and eventually serving under General Vasily Ivanov. Never a military man at heart, he learned to suppress his personal ideals for the benefit of Russia, facing some of the most brutal battle against the Reich without once questioning orders.\n\nFor Drygin, Ivanov's declaration of neutrality in the West Russian War was an eye-opener. Seeing military achievement sacrificed to protect human life inspired him, and his war-hardened cynicism rapidly disintegrated. He ran for the People's Assembly almost immediately after its foundation, and became the founder of its Democratic faction, avidly promoting reforms for the territory's peasant population.\n\nDrygin has long had dreams of making Vologda the democratic pearl of western Russia. Now that he has consolidated power in the People's Assembly, he is well-positioned to make them reality."
 VOL_neutral_zone: "中立地帯"
 VOL_neutral_zone_desc: "Enough bloodshed; with these words General Ivanov has decreed the cessation of fighting in the sector under his command. No longer will we shed Russian blood while the hated German has already broken the Homeland's spine and while civilians fear for their lives. No - we will protect those under our care, and wait for better days. Then, and only then, will we strike."

 VOL_ONG_Miklay_Kazakov: "Miklay Kazakov"
 POLITICS_MIKLAY_KAZAKOV_DESC: "The Mari people had long been denied their nationhood by every Russian state and its successors who ruled over them. Whether they bore the red banner of socialism or the tricolor, it was all the same, but Miklay Ivanovich Kazakov made it his life's goal to change that. As the victory of the Anti-Communist Guard in West Russia became almost an inevitability, he rallied ethnic Mari across the region to join a Mari Regiment which fought alongside the Guard.\n\nLabelled the \"warrior poet\" by his compatriots, as he always kept a passion for poetry and literature, Kazakov was the obvious choice to be placed as the leader of the first ethnic Mari state and so he became.\n\nThe Republic has been another success story for North Russia, as Kazakov has stabilized it and looks to other states of the Idel-Ural as well as Arkhangelsk for cooperation and solidarity."
