DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_one_name_one:"Alexander Andrae"
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_one_name_one_desc:"THE MODERATE WEREWOLVES \n\nAlexander Andrae served loyally in the Luftwaffe and lead the artillery corps of Germany in the two World Wars and the West Russian War. After his service, using contacts from his days in the police, he moved from military affairs to political affairs, becoming prominent in Prussia. After the revolution, Andrae became the military head of the Werwolf groups."
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_one_name_two:"Reinhard Gehlen"
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_one_name_two_desc:"THE LOYAL WEREWOLVES \n\nAn agent of many stripes, Gehlen was once loyal to Hitler, then to Speer, and finally to Tresckow. A veteran of the Second World War and one of the most high-ranking intelligence officials in the Gestapo, the spymaster was always pragmatic and sided with whoever he deemed would assist in the destruction of Judeo-Bolshevism. After the revolution, it was Gehlen who organized the most fervorous nazis under the resistance."
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_one_name_three:"Franz Stangl"
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_one_name_three_desc:"THE SS-WERWOLF \n\nOne of the most hated men by every victim of Nazism, Stangl was not only a Commander for the Schutzstaffel but was directly involved in the massive atrocities carried out by the Reich. A ruthless and cold killer, he joined Heydrich's ranks during the civil war and was imprisoned in Düsseldorf, but managed to escape and regrouped with local Himmler sympathizers. However, Franz refused to flee to Burgundy, assisting the Werwolf by starting a terror campaign."
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_two_name_one:"Adolf von Thadden"
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_two_name_one_desc:"THE MODERATE WEREWOLVES \n\nThe half-brother of an executed resistance member, Thadden was much unlike his sister, serving the Wehrmacht pridefully and loyally while being a member of the NSDAP himself. Being a close ally of Speer, he was demoted from his position during Tresckow's reforms, which allowed him to work under the radar and organize the political wing of the Werwolf movement as a coalition of anti-communist forces."
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_two_name_two:"Hans-Ulrich Rudel"
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_two_name_two_desc:"THE LOYAL WEREWOLVES \n\nThe most decorated pilot of the war, the one who would bridge the gap between every faction of Wehrmacht veterans who would not surrender, Rudel was one of Hitler's most loyal followers and was respected throughout all of the Reich. His public appeal and influence led him to the Werwolf program, in which he commands a military wing in Saxony, known for being decently equipped."
DDR_nazi_hunt_nazi_character_one_name_four:"Collected Werwolf Remnants"

DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_one_name_one:"Karl Maron"
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_one_name_one_desc:"A communist since 1926, Karl Maron left for Russia during the Nazi regime and only returned to join Markus Wolf's organized guerrilla cells. Initially studying in the Soviet Union and then educating himself, he became proficient in various topics, such as economics, security, and healthcare. Carefully analyzing the mistakes and successes of the USSR's militsiya, he was instrumental in constructing the Volkspolizei."
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_one_name_two:"Willy Stoph"
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_one_name_two_desc:"Returning from his exile in Madagascar after Speer's victory, Stoph was known as a reformist and retained his post as a general in the Reich. However, right under the noses of his fellow commanders, he and other unsatisfied officers had conjured a plot to revolt, which was facilitated by the revolution. His interests aligned perfectly with Mielke's and Wolf's and the union of their armies created the NVA."
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_one_name_three:"Karl Steinhoff"
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_one_name_three_desc:"If you say the word 'experience' in the republic, Steinhoff is the first associated with it. A doctor-in-law who had been part of the ministries and administration of the Weimar Republic, he was dismissed from government services by the Reich due to his SPD membership. After decades of political inactivity, he joined the SED during his time in the 'Red Rhine' and was instrumental in building a socialist law and order in the region."
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_one_name_four:"Emergency Committee for Anti-Communist Activities"
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_two_name_one:"Horst Sindermann"
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_two_name_one_desc:"A member of the communist youth, persecuted by the Reich and imprisoned in various concentration camps throughout his life, Sindermann was tortured for decades and kept alive only as an example, but saw thousands of his comrades be executed. Being freed by Willi Stoph, the duo worked together in building up the NVA politically and militarily. Eventually, he joined the SED and was assigned to supervise the Volkspolizei in enforcing De-Nazification."
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_two_name_two:"Friedrich Dickel"
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_two_name_two_desc:"A close friend of Mielke and a veteran of the international brigades, Dickel would settle in the Soviet Union after the civil war was lost. Known as an experienced colonel in the KPD, he would join the Revolutionäre Zellen as they moved westwards, participating in guerilla warfare and becoming a general for the NVA during the revolution. Along with Maron, he was a founding head of the Volkspolizei."
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_three_name_one:"Bernhard Elsner"
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_three_name_one_desc:"A soldier in Eastern Prussia, Bernhard Elsner had served behind the lines in the West Russian War and been acknowledged as skilled by the Gestapo, which recruited him. While participating in a mission in Moskowien, he became disillusioned with the Reich and secretly joined the Wolf-led resistance. Sabotaging the Gestapo from the inside during the revolution and convincing agents to change sides, Elsner earned his spot as a supervisor of the Volkspolizei."
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_three_name_two:"Wolfgang Schwanitz"
DDR_nazi_hunt_stasi_character_three_name_two_desc:"Being part of the new wave of German leftism, Schwanitz was part of diverse student movements before he was able to infiltrate the Hitlerjügend as an agent working alongside the communist guerrillas. His experience in successful intelligence operations that enticed division and rebellion within the ranks of the NSDAP's youth, would justify his relevancy in the SED and the Volkspolizei."

nh_information_tt:"The GUI in front of you is a turn-based strategy with a goal of either reducing the enemy health bar to below 10% or eliminating all enemies. Each character is either a representative of a task force, dedicated to disabling the remnants of the Reich, on the left, or a character representing a partisan group, fighting the newly established DVR, on the right. \n\nAll of them have 3 stats: supply, being their resources, morale, the general state of mind of the force, and corruption, how the force is susceptible to enemy influence. Morale restores supply in linear proportion, with 15 supply gain on 100 morale, 10 on 66 and so on, and supply acts as a threshold, which allows more complex operations to commence. Both sides have 6 operations they can choose from that have different effects and tooltips for information. \n\nShould both supply and morale of a character fall below 5, the character is considered "eliminated", getting completely removed from the battle. Also, both health bars reduce every time any character of the side receives damage and it CANNOT be restored, as the side that has lost cannot continue the active fighting anymore. \n\nLosing one battle is not the loss of the campaign. But in the finale the enemy will have more forces - being a good commander is in your interest..."
