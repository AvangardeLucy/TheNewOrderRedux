 POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "What would one call Prince Demchugdongrub - the hero of Mongolia, or the traitor of the Chinese Nation? Born in the Sönid Right Banner in 1902, Prince De is the 31st generation descendant of the Golden Clan and the only son of Prince Namjil Wangchuk. Six years later, Prince De inherited his father's title with the approval of the Aisin Gioro court, and was indoctrinated with the essence of the Chinese Civilization. Among all historical figures, Genghis Khan, the ancestor of Prince De, was whom the young Prince worshiped the most, and whose legacy the Prince pursued after throughout his life.\n\nWhen Prince De concurrently served as the Chief of the Xilingol League in 1931, much has changed in the steppe throughout the troubled times - the Kuomintang has replaced the fallen Qing Empire and the Beiyang Regime as the Central Government of China, whereas Outer Mongolia was lost under the schemes of Russia. Later, the Mukden Incident would let Prince De make use of Nanjing's fear to start his Pan-Mongolian self-rule movement. After negotiations fell apart due to the Han Chauvinism of Chiang Kai-Shek and his followers, Prince De turned to his last resort - the Kwantung Army - out of strong desire to achieve his ambitions, despite realizing that the Japanese carried no goodwill in their offer.\n\nDecades of struggle have partially fulfilled the Prince's dream. Nine years after the Greater East Asia War, the Mongol Autonomous Government crushed the forces of the Soviet puppet and recovered the lost territories in the wake of the Siberian Intervention. However, despite Prince De's grand accomplishments, Mongolia has yet been united, let alone independent - Mengjiang is still a de jure vassal of Wang Jingwei and his dogs, as well as a de facto fiefdom of Kwantung. The lands of Eastern Mongolia remain under the grip of Manchukuo, and the resistance of Outer Mongolia never stops troubling the Prince.\n\nSome despise Prince De as a traitor humiliating the spirit of Genghis Khan, while some condemn him as an upstart vassal with delusions of grandeur. Somehow, Prince De echoes with their words - for he has zero desire to follow the steps of his previous overlord Puyi as a Japan puppet. With Nanjing announcing their Modernization Programme, Prince De vigilantly feels that the storm of revolution will soon reach East Asia once more, and perhaps this will be his last chance to prove himself as the worthy descendant of Genghis Khan - the last chance to free Mongolia from the oppressors."

Many elements in our government are calling for the reconquest of Mengjiang, claiming that it would be irresponsible of us to not return order to the steppes, and that standing down now would be little more than an admission of weakness.

Prince De has expressed shock and outrage at the very thought that his authority would not be restored in Mengjiang and many people had simply assumed that the old status quo would be reinforced. However there are those who have lost faith in the Prince and claim that for De to return would merely mean repeating this war in ten years time.

But time and again we fall apart into petty infighting, and deliver ourselves as slaves to the Chinese. In the great war, aided by the great Japanese Empire Prince Demchugdongrub set out to unite his beloved people once again. In the footsteps of Modun Shanyu and Chinggis Khan he united his people under his name for the first time in centuries, earning his place in the great line of Mongol rulers. But not all have yet submitted.\n\nOur fair Mongolia greets this day a divided and bleeding people. In the previous weeks a treasonous coalition of bandits and communists swept through the Mongol steppes, catching our own armed forces off guard and once more dividing our people. With a combination of luck and trickery these vagrents have taken the momentum, even capturing our capital Urga, known to the reds as \"Ulaanbataar\". This shall not stand. The Mongol will never again fight his brother while being stabbed in the back by a Chinese dagger. Already our great Prince Demchugdongrub has called on every true Mongol to defend their nation and sovereign with the zeal of a thousand warriors.

Some of the more jingoistic and independent-minded officers want to directly drag Tokyo into the Mongolian rebellion, but this could lead to a dangerous precedence of wasting men, resources and materiel into small-scale conflicts that our proxies should be able to solve by themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the idea of direct intervention isn't that bad, as it gives us an opportunity to experiment with airborne and helicopter tactics in coordination with armoured and motorised thrusts - a doctrinal boost in an ever-modernising battlefield. In addition, it also gives some of our newly-graduated airmen a proving ground - the skies of Mongolia are vast, and there's little opposition to shoot them down.\n\nLastly, it will remind Prince Demchugdongrub to not get cocky in his internal affairs, and hopefully this would be the end of our massive investments in the Mongolian conflict."

With this in mind, the North China Area Army has proposed that an All-Mongolian Conference of Unity is to be held in Beijing - neutral, safe ground away from the front lines, with the idea of forming a pan-Mongolian, anti Bolshevik front against Tsedenbal's forces.\n\nThose in attendance would be the high-ranking commanders of the Kwantung Army and the North China Area Army, as well as the Minister of Finance, Kanemaru Shin.

They were here to 'handle' communist guerrillas behind the frontline whilst we focused on the enemy, we were told by Tokyo, but their sinister appearance signaled as if they were here for much more than partisans. Unloading truckloads of equipment and arms, the uniformed agents drew particular attention from our own men who were apprehensive of such an unsettling presence.\n\nTheir silence was foreboding, as it seemed they refused to speak to anyone other than who they were permitted to. We thank them and shake their hands for their service now, but with whispers and suspicion of ulterior motives, must remain aware of their praetorian position within our borders."

 MEN_Saving_the_Country_desc:0 "This great land, sacred home to the great Mongolian peoples, has for generations been divided and weak. A people who were once lead by great Khans riding over the whole earth and making fools of the Chinese had become wretched vassals. Now we are once more united and free but for the treasonous men who we now must face. Let the pure sky and steppe not be polluted by these criminals, to arms!"

 MEN_Destroy_Resistance_Agents_desc:0 "The people are being lead astray by the insidious agents of the rebellion; like a plague rat wherever they are found soon after the sickness of discontent rears its head. They must be destroyed as the harbingers of pain and deceit they are, and the nation returned to a state of harmony, lest we fall back into anarchy once again."

The hearts of the loyal remain true even behind enemy lines and the enemy caravans are guarded only by the lightest of arms. By raiding the enemy and empowering those still true to us the bastard enemy will falter."

 MEN_By_the_Princes_Orders_desc:0 "Prince Demchugdongrub was born into a servile and divided Mongolia, home to an atomized and nearly forgotten people. But by his hand and in the way of the great Khan from who he is descended the Prince struck out against all of his peoples enemies. It is such a great man who the people are commanded by, and who they should love and fear in equal measure. For by his orders, we ride."

Our battles and skirmishes so far have not yielded any decisive victory, and the broken state of the Mongol people persists against all that is right, and the peoples own will. This ends now, as our forces and all the people of Mongolia must come together and destroy these devils who brought such suffering upon the land. This time, there will be no turning back!"

 MEN_The_Relentless_Attack_desc:0 "We will not and frankly cannot allow this rebelion to continue. It must be crushed totally and swiftly. Our loyal men must charge and charge again into the enemy and chase him away before the damage done to Mongolia gets any worse. The harsher the war, the better the peace is a time honored fact, so let us go forth and conquer."

 MEN_Nomadic_Legacy_desc:0 "From the earliest days of childhood every Mongol knows the horse, and in his song and dance the horse remains. It was on horseback that the Mongol race made a name for itself and it is this unique and unsurpassed tradition of horsemanship which must be marshalled in times of war. No one in the world can match our calvary, not even our missguided foes."

Not one day will the Mongol go unreminded of the Prince and all he has done for the nation. It is under his banner that every Mongol of the steppes lives, workes, fights and dies. He is the Prince, and we are at last united under him: we shall not forget it."
 MEN_Japanese_Support:0 "日本の支援を要求"
 MEN_Japanese_Support_desc:0 "A saddening number of Mongols have been lead astray by the lies of bandits and into rebelion, even capturing our capital city. The Prince has seen dark days before, and just as he once rode beside the Japanese to unite the people he may now request the old friendship be called upon again to correct the people. Who would not ask for a friend's aid in times of need?"

 MEN_Intensify_Japanese_Bombing_desc:0 "Perhaps the most potent weapon in the Japanese arsenal is their air forces: flying in uncontested skys with clear targets and few restrictions the Japanese pilots will surely shine as they have rarely been able to before. By their bombs and their guns the treasonous shall flee in fear."

 MEN_Death_From_Above_desc:0 "The Japanese bombing campaign has been just as successful as we had hoped. While large formations do not often appear in steppe warfare the supply trains and treasonous camps in which they live have had no peace. By redoubling the effort and supplies of the bombing campaign the traitors will be blasted from this earth."

 MEN_Slash_And_Burn_desc:0 "The price of treason is death. The price of harboring and aiding such criminals is death. The price of impeding those who seek to deliver justice to the betrayer is death. Entire families and even towns have become complicit in the betrayal of the Prince and the Mongol people, and for such a crime they cannot be allowed to live. The enemy behind is just as deadly as those ahead, and shall be destroyed just as swiftly."

They have stuck up in Tuva and terrorized the local population. Mongolia may be stable again, but it will never be whole, as long as its westernmost provinces exist under communist imperialist occupation. The wise prince Demchugdongrub wills it and the Shо̄wa will grant his wishes.\n\nThats the official version of the story at least. IJA officers know that the Mongolian officers will engage this conflict and bring combat to west Mongolia, and has figured that it would better to mobilize some divisions to assist the operation in order to guarantee success."
