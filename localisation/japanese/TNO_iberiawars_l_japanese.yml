 iberiawars.998.d:0 "Fernando sat in his office, gazing out the window at his officers frantically preparing the barricades all over the town of Gibraltar. His golden hat and over-ornamented uniform felt heavier than they had in months, and the pleasant buzz of the illicit pleasures of Gibraltar had turned into a wash of cold horror within his head.\n\nWith trembling hands, he stripped the hat off, removing the weight from his head. Next to go was his new golden adornment, dropped on the floor without a care. He continued to stare, thinking about the terrors that were about to descend upon his position.\n\nHe could flee, he knew that. He could run to Italy, or Greece, with his riches, and-\n\nAnd die, when the tidal waves would destroy everything.\n\nAs he thought, a feeling that he had not felt in years slipped over him, hardening his expression like iron. With manic abandon, he tore open his wardrobe, and gazed upon something that had been abandoned since he had taken over in the first place.\n\nSeamless white, with gold braid. It was dusty, and somewhat disheveled from being ignored for so long.\n\nBut now... it was not the time for pleasure. All parties had to end, and his time had come long ago.\n\nHe slipped the old hat back on, and wiped the dust off the crest of the Iberian Navy on the front. With automatic ease, he straightened seams that had been softened by disuse.\n\nNow was not the time for games. Now was the time to be a hero once more."

The many Portuguese officials whose loyalty was always to their national identity and Caudillo Salazar first began to grumble as soon as the first reports of the revolt came in. The final straw was triggered when Salazar abandoned all hope of maintaining the sinking ship. Caudillo Salazar attempted to escape Madrid without much fuss but was quickly put under house arrest in his local residence in the Iberian capital. Only with the support of loyal followers was the old man able to stage a successful nighttime getaway.\n\nA mass exodus of Portuguese government officials and military personnel followed, leaving behind an administrative vacuum that Spanish bureaucrats hurriedly attempted to fill. Lisbon has now become a hotbed of revolutionary fervour. The cries for independence and self governance are resonating all across the Union. Salazar's public broadcasts have rallied the Porutgues people to form militia divisions to fight alongside the national army against Unionist forces."

 iberiawars.301.d:0 "The fight for independence has proven to be a strong rallying factor for the Portuguese both in the Iberian Peninsula and further abroad. Troops stationed in former Portugal colonies such as Cabo Verde and Guinea-Bissau have also rejected the mantle of Iberian unity in favour of fighting for their old homeland. The regions are now under firm control with Unionist forces yet still unable to recapture them successfully. The former Portuguese empire is enjoying a resurgence despite the instability caused by the Iberian civil war\n\nOne exception, São Tomé y Principe, where local forces felt compelled to fight the war on the frontlines instead of acting as a glorified garrison, has seen resistance to the re-establishment of Portuguese imperial control. Their abandonment of the colony has allowed native resistance cells to act more freely. The situation has given the PAIGC independence movement renewed strength in their previously futile mission. With their leaders sensing the opportunity as good as any to return from exile a bitter guerilla war has begun to be waged."

The expanding harsh guerilla campaign fought by the rebels has incentivized the Portuguese government to take action and also withdraw forces from Cabo Verde and Guinea-Bissau. To keep up the occupation would have required continuous resupply and troop reinforcement, something the newly independent country could not afford in its battle for survival on the Peninsula.\n\nSoon after their withdrawal the PAIGC militias entered Bisáu and Praia unopposed, seizing all important administrative and military buildings. It was not long before the rebels seized the initiative and broadcasted their supposed victory over the European colonizers, calling for all patriotic freedom fighters to celebrate their newfound independence. The loss has greatly damaged our prestige even if it was seen as a necessary move by most observers. Unfortunately some in the armed forces did not share this view and have heavily criticized the decision as an act of cowardice. This faction led by general Kaúlza de Arriaga has called for regaining the colonies at the first opportune moment. They have found support and allies in the north of our nation which is known to be a conservative hotbed. Far more worryingly some towns in the region have begun to plead alignment to a movement calling itself the 'Government of National Salvation' which seems to be acting as a direct challenger for authority in Portugal."

With the abandonment however came heightened tensions between the local population and the Iberian administration. It was not long before Orungu troops, who had offered their support to the independence revolt which had been brewing ever since Portugal had seceded, entered the region and quickly forced the remaining colonial soldiers to retreat. Sensing that the situation was beyond repairable the Iberian mission completely abandoned Equatorial Guinea in favour of attempting to salvage the situation on the homefront."

This however had allowed the opportunity for the freedom fighters which had previously been successfully suppressed to finally rise against those who they declared to be their oppressors. Under the name of the São Tomé and Principe Liberation Movement or MLSTP for short the various native groups have come together and forced the remaining Iberian garrisons to surrender without much of a violent confrontation. The guerillas then promptly entered the regional capital and to a jubilant civilian population publicly declared total independence from the Iberian Union."

 iberiawars.4.d:0 "Under the cover of darkness, a lone old military truck joined the convoys and the persistent businessmen on the long highway to Lisbon. Neither seeking profit in the late hours nor making its way to the front, it drove into the Portuguese capital with a single purpose.\n\nFollowing the unfortunate but necessary evacuation of Guinea in order to not get pushed into a protracted colonial conflict and to reinforce the Iberian front with hardened garrison soldiers, a military clique of disgruntled officers had formed. Under the leadership of Kaúlza de Arriaga the conservative cabal was able to influence a number of towns in the north of the country to support the legitimacy of a new administration, the Government of National Salvation. Its mission was to wipe the stain of abandoning the Portuguese imperial holdings from the national consciousness, ensuring that every soldier and citizen could stand side by side pridefully to fight for a strong country. Loyalists to our regime have leaked plans of the clique to attempt to use their newfound support to successfully carry out a putsch. We also know exactly when they plan to execute their mission.\n\nThe driver gasped in surprise and turned quickly to his passengers. Pointing ahead to the side of the road all could see the two tanks and a large number of military personnel checking each lone passerby. With an angry grumble a man at the back of the truck waved for the driver to turn around. 'Let them have it this way,' he thought. 'Portugal and its soul could have been saved with minimal bloodshed.'"

Many are calling for the so-called \"liberation\" of what they perceive as their rightful lands. No doubt, their true goal is to destroy everything we've spent decades building and return to their former barbarous ways.\n\nHowever, many of the more sane amongst them still recognize that a full and immediate break from our influence may prove detrimental to their weak, fledgling state. Indeed, without our control, they may lack the necessary defences to resist other foreign powers. Few want to escape from the frying pan should it mean landing in the fire.\n\nUnderstanding this, Hassan II of Morocco has given us an offer: recognize Morocco's independence and gain an ally, or refuse recognition and remain alone against the revolutionary onslaught.\n\nShould we recognize Morocco, we would gain an immediate ally and prevent the opening of yet another front in this already straining war. However, it is unlikely that this alliance would last long past this conflict's resolution, meaning we'd be deprived of direct access to the nation's industry and resources going forward.\n\nEven still, a war with Morocco would be unwinnable in our current state. Our ability to reconquer the traitorous Moroccan state would hinge entirely on our ability to win the ongoing conflict in Iberia proper, which would be much easier with aid from Morocco.\n\nUltimately, after much deliberation, we've concluded that..."

Chief among these are supporting the Iberians in their war effort and securing our newly gained territories.\n\nProviding the Iberians with aid should prove simple enough as, at least for now, the frontlines are far from the heart of Morocco. This should mean producing weapons, equipment, and supplies will be to no detriment of our own. Of course, transporting these goods securely is another ordeal, but with proper planning it is certainly doable.\n\nSecuring our new territories may prove much more difficult. The edges of our kingdom still remain engulfed in conflict, and many are dissatisfied with our government's collaboration with the Iberian State. As it stands our military is unprepared to deal with an organized insurgency, so the best we can do is prepare and hope beyond hope that the situation does not escalate.\n\nRegardless of these issues, now is a time of celebration for the Moroccan people, as we once more taste true freedom after countless years of subjugation."

Taking inspiration from the anti-spanish and pro-republican sentiments brought about in the initial Rif uprising decades prior, these radicals seek an immediate break from all Iberian influence as well as the abolition of Morocco's long standing monarchy.\n\nThough territorially small in comparison to Morocco proper, the Rif rebels hold key Moroccan port cities as well as a relatively large population given their land area, not to mention that they represent an increasingly popular idea within our own borders.

Jumping up he dashed as fast as his legs could carry him.

Shortly afterwards Galicia blocked access to all roads to and from their provinces. Given the rapidly escalating tensions it was perhaps not surprising that the next proclamation to arrive from Santiago was a claim that the interests of Galicia no longer align with those of Madrid and that the only logical course of action was independence.\n\nThe secession of Galicia puts us in a tough spot. While their treachery can not be abided, our resources are already stretched to their breaking point. We can ill afford to open another frontline at this juncture.

 jap.2041.d:0 "The small port city had become a good deal more cosmopolitan in the last few weeks. For the most part, the tiny handful of Iberians were gone, as the nomadic Berbers of the interior moved north towards their settled cousins and the Arabs in the cities. And then of course, there were all the soldiers of fortune, and the Japanese 'advisors', a group which included Private Nosaka.\n\nNosaka was on leave one particular day, and decided to take in as much of the city as he could, staying within the safe zones. Moroccan ordinance was not particularly accurate, and it had not done significant damage to any key infrastructure, but Nosaka imagined that would be cold comfort for those who now lived without homes. Less so for those who no longer lived. He could feel a palpable sense of tension wherever he went, even if he didn't understand the words spoken. Much like had been the case in the 1920s, interior nomads still formed the core of the Rifian military. Their hard faces regarded the city with suspicion. The positions, angles, terrain, all different to what they were used to. They regarded who Nosaka assumed to be Arabs with considerable suspicion. The Arabs, for their part, glared right back at them and some shouted, but little violence had occurred so far. So far.\n\nAs the siege continued, Nosaka noticed the markets slowly shrink and become abandoned, as the lines for Japanese and Red Crescent food packages grew larger and larger. The livestock brought into the city by some of the nomads became gradually more emaciated. However, Nosaka was still eating okay, and nobody seemed to be starving. For now."

 jap.2042.d:0 "Kentaro and the rest of the engineering company moved into the town at the light of dawn. A major battle between the Rif and Morocco was expected in the coming days, leaving precious little time to build the necessary fortifications- especially if they planned to get out before the shooting started.\n\nHe did not know the village's name. He only knew that a light Moroccan garrison had been cleared out recently, and the town had been 'cleared of traitors' shortly after. Kentaro had some grim ideas about what that might have meant, but all he saw upon entering the town was stillness. No people came out to greet them, or walked the streets, and even animals could not be seen. The wind did not move, and the low rumble of the trucks was the only sound to be heard. They moved into the empty square, and began to survey the position.\n\nHours of digging and dragging followed, as trenches were dug, pillboxes were constructed and guns were moved into place. Kentaro's shovel plowed through the soil, until it made contact with something which was not soil. Minutes of scraping followed, and the whole sight became apparent. Decomposing limbs lay limp across tattered heaps of ruined cloth, forming an indistinguishable mound of flesh. Men, women, children. One of the privates threw up, and the rest stared in shock for a few seconds. Then they moved on, and continued with their task. They had a job to do, and the corpses were creating a hole in the defensive line.A couple of hours later, the task was finished, and the perimeter was established. Unknown bodies rotted in a muddled heap outside the town, safely out of the way."

We need to go now.\"\n\nMurano Keiichi couldn't help but grimace, glancing at the absolute disgraceful work of a defense they've built up around this particular village, the glance of the Rif soldiers as uncertain as the man were, and well..., if any of his instructors in the IJA were here to see this, they would scream his ear off and send him back to boot camp for the sheer disgrace this fortification would be.\n\nBarely hidden mines and razor wires stretched across the acrid, dry floor, while a backline made of hastily dug together trenches, held by few wooden planks, and genuine faith. Behind, the village was also booby-trapped, the citizens evacuated and each home locked as both a fort against external invasion, but in his machine, also massive deathtraps, with the amount of ammunition and explosives being set on it. He wishes he could do more, something smarter, more meaningful, but he knew in advance his work was one to constantly set up diversions, to the rampaging forces behind them.\n\nMurano's unit felt like rats, constantly chased by a persistent, immortal cat, and each trap and fortification they've set up was more half-assed, brittle than the next one until it would finally be caught up with them...but what could they do? Murano glanced tiredly at his lieutenant, giving a short nod, and a pitying glance at the Rif units behind him, underequipped and underprepared for what's going to come, only the fire in their eyes, or perhaps desperation, was any amount of edge they would have.\n\nBy morning, their squadron was hundreds of miles away, the sounds of gunfire echoing softly in the distance.\n\nBy evening, there wouldn't be any village near Amezrou anymore, only rising pillars of smoke the sign of any life that community ever had."

 jap.2044.d:0 "Mounir was grateful for any military assistance he could get, though he wished the process was a deal less kafkaesque. The Japanese colonel would speak in Japanese, his interpreter would translate to Arabic, and then he would deliver it to the men in Berber. This process caused considerable confusion, and a good deal of time was wasted clarifying misunderstandings, or puzzling over technical terms which had yet to receive any kind of direct Berber translation. Still, it was unavoidable given the circumstances, and the men did seem to be learning something.\n\nOn this particular day, the colonel was furiously tapping away with his pointer at the large map, explaining the finer points of mountain supply routes and defences, while the Arabic translator and Mounir struggled to keep up. Even as his mind raced between two languages, however, he found a lot of the advice given to be a little strange. He understood the importance of safeguarding resources and industry to maintain an army, but the Japanese seemed to place an emphasis on mineral deposits which bordered on the tactically unsound. Many were not even developed, and the Moroccans could afford to lose men over them in a way the Rifians could not.\n\nThen there was the flat, dispassionate tone which the Japanese always seemed to possess. They seemed like extremely distant people. There was very little fraternizing between the Rifians and the Japanese, and the only times where they seemed to leave their barracks was to engage in this mad dance of tapping at maps and cycling through tongues. All in all, Mounir wasn't certain why they'd taken an interest in this fledgling nation. They didn't have any resources that Japan didn't already have in abundance, and Morocco posed no threat to Asia. Something bigger had to be at foot, but Mounir didn't have the time or patience to comprehend it."
