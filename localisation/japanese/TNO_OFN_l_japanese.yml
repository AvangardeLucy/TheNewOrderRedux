 OFN.1.t:0 "南アフリカサミット"
 OFN.1.desc:0 "待望のアメリカ主催の「南アフリカでの軍事行動サミット」の日がやってきた。アメリカ代表は、この戦いに向けてOFNが一丸となる必要性についてかなり熱のこもったスピーチをした。ドイツの崩壊を招いたのは統一条約の連携不足であること、日本はOFNにしか出来ない多国籍軍の共同対応には頼れないことが主張された。アメリカ代表団が「この脅威に対処しないことは他のOFN加盟国にとっても脅威が及ぶ」ことを主張し、恐怖の兆しも押し出された。\n\nマクナマラの演説はスティッカー副長官や亡命政府の代表者団から拍手が送られ、カナダとオーストラリアの代表団も小さく賛同したが、他の代表団は躊躇っている様子であった。\n\n最も印象的な反応は西インド諸島、[USAGetIcelandAndGuyana]からの代表団であり、彼らは皆戦争への不関与を既に表明していた。昨年メロワ・ジュニア将軍の死去により米軍の占領が解かれたアイスランドの初代大統領であり、急進的民族主義者としても知られるトルベルソン大統領が提案への反対勢力の先頭に立った。アメリカの様々な「傀儡国家」は、アメリカの挑戦に興味を示したことは一度もなく、異国の地で自国民が死ぬのは許さないと断言し、彼の演説には再び他の代表団から拍手が沸き起こった。\n\n最終的な決定は投票に委ねられる。大勢が、OFNは鋼鉄の同盟なのか紙の同盟なのかを固唾を飲んで見守っている。"

With the state of the Federation, this is certainly not the optimal time to send out troops we could sue to enforce the peace. Demands are demands and we realize we have no choice in the matter, so today we have sent out telegrams to various stations to call out for volunteers."

 OFN.13.desc:0 "Aboard Air Force One, Nixon rested in the President's private office, his neck craned over to read the daily briefing sitting on the desk. Alone with only the hum of the aircraft's engines filling the silence, the President skimmed through the papers, wielding a pen as he scribbled his thoughts onto the yellow notepad in his lap. Near the end of the briefing, Nixon paused, curiosity behind his eyes. He read the last paragraph slowly to himself before reaching for a nearby telephone.\n\nAn onboard CIA officer quietly stepped in, only to be met with Nixon's questioning, perhaps prying, tone. \"What is this?\" The officer's gaze switched between the President's and the briefing that lay on the desk. Was this some kind of joke?\n\n\"...That would be your daily briefing, sir,\" uttered the puzzled officer.\n\n\"I know what it is, goddamnit—I want to know what the hell it's talking about,\" Nixon growled. Turning the briefing so that it faced the officer, Nixon scooted forward and pointed to the last paragraph. The officer leaned forward, squinting his eyes. Finally realizing what troubled the President, he quickly straightened himself.\n\n\"We've determined that the explosion in public support for intervention in the South African War is a social phenomenon more than anything else,\" the officer began clearly. \"This support is subject to rapid change—a response to what happens on the frontlines. Furthermore, recent data suggests that our military personnel's performance relies on the public's support for their duties.\" Nixon silently nodded along.\n\n\"We've also found that while many Americans believe the war is justified, this may not be the case for future conflicts.\" The officer paused, almost hesitant to continue. \"I advise you to read the memorandum on West Africa for more details, Mr. President.\""

 OFN.14.desc:0 "Desmond, an active construction worker in New York City, heads to a grocery store to pick up the latest edition of the New York Times. He had a long conversation with a coworker about the South African War, and the conflict was still fresh in his mind as he left work today.\nThe man selected his copy from the grocery store counter and opened it, finding today's leading headline in bold: \"WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA RAGES ON.\" Ever since war broke out between the Reichskommissars and the Republic, Desmond was known to be strongly apathetic towards it by those around him. After all, with what happened the last time America fought abroad, how was this going to be any different? He began reading about the recent German offensives ripping through the South African heartland and wondered why he was paying taxes to support such a pointless war. Once he reached the bottom of the article, a new bold headline appeared directly under it: \"BOER MASSACRES TAKE HUNDREDS OF LIVES.\"\n\nDesmond couldn't believe what he was reading in this article. The Boers, supported by Germany, were brutally raping, enslaving, and killing women and children; at least 500 individuals suffered at the hands of the invading party, and the war was only just beginning. It was then that Desmond really saw the scope of the war and why it was so necessary for Americans to get involved: innocent, unarmed human lives were at stake. The man imagined what could have happened if his wife, daughter, and son were victims of the Boer atrocities. As he gave the cashier a handful of coins, he began to contemplate whether he really can support the war effort."
