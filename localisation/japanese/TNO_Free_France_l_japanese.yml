However, second place would most likely go to Pierre Mendès France.\n\nAfter France's surrender, Mendès France was sentenced to six years of imprisonment on a false charge of desertion. However, he escaped, and joined the Free French forces, where he served as part of a combat group, doing sabotage missions. He joined the CFLN in 1943, and acted as the official liaison between the OFN and Free France throughout the 40s and 50s.\n\nTo Mendès France, De Gaulle is nothing more than a tinpot dictator, and the Free French army a corrupt hive where few true allies remain. He opposed expansion in Africa, and also any violent attempt at reclaiming France. In 1962, he was the one to push for a French Constitution in Free French territories, which had been suspended nearly two decades prior.\n\nMendès France represents both a strong commitment to socialism in a deeply conservative country, and to a moral compass that has never been put aside."

There will be no true victory until liberty spread its wings over the nations it has won.\n\nThe nations of West Africa and exiles of France cry for our help. They argue that only America's involvement in the reconstruction can save West Africa for itself. For our part, corporations like Firestone and DuPont are chomping at the bit to exploit the resources in the region. President [GetName] has approved the initial aid packages and projects, and it is up to us to ensure that we hold West Africa humanely.\n\nIt is a hard task.

A farmer stood in its shadow, looking right and left before spitting at it.\n\nIt had been a hard year for West Africa. He saw his sons go to war, returning home in caskets draped in the tricolour. Farmhands went away to serve, never to be seen again. The land, arid though it was, splayed its gifts as tidings to ease the burden of grief. That, too, was being taken away from him. He turned his head eastwards towards the city of Bamako, growing, accreting all the riches of this land.\n\nHe saw the new roads, packed with people from the other villages. New buildings, stamped in the signage of the American companies. He shook his head. How did it come to this? He saw the soldiers dig into the reservoirs of the earth, diverting it to the plantations. In their eyes was the dull blaze of idle disdain. Their ears met his complaints with deft ignorance. He sighed. Inching forward, little by little, he walked to the city."

Youthful men, barely out of their twenties, already numbed to the suffering of so many. Diallo saw it in their eyes, too. Deadened. Some joked and lit up cigarettes, attempting to hide that premonition of guilt.\n\nThe trucks clambered over low hills, the mud trails winding through clearings in the jungle. They passed through checkpoints enclosed by walls of chicken-wire. The spotlights searing through the jungle with its cyclopean gaze. Diallo knew not where he was going. It did not matter.\n\nAs the land flattened and the jungle canopies retreated to far-off corners, plantations appeared. The rubber trees neatly planted, row upon row. Workers ambled about their bases, collecting latex in small buckets. Diallo and his children watched them go by, little by little, until the neat trees and shambling men grew smaller into dots in the horizon. The advancing treeline swallowed all.\n\nThey reached their camp not long after. They stepped off their vehicles and went in a line to their quarters. Improvised huts with thatched roofs barely enough for two, let alone five. Regardless, they drew their legs in, and waited for the morning to come."

Sighing, he continued. \"The only incentive they keep here is with guns. Bad news. Soldiers watching from ditches to make sure they tap every tree properly.

She carried one Polaroid with her anyway. Taking pictures of things she'd rather forget. Searing in colour the things she saw. She saw those pictures crawl out of her Polaroid, horror etched against every corner, mundane and plain. She stared at those fingers again, noticing the missing fingers, the scars of slashes rending through flesh.\n\nShe quizzed the children. Early risers against their own will.

Firestone extracts rubber tapped from their plantations in Mali, shipping them off to their plants in Liberia. Though the arrangement had suited Firestone in the past, the immense growth of the company's assets had meant that this process had become a bottleneck.\n\nThe talks began when DuPont approached the corporate leadership at Firestone. They made a general gesture: if Firestone agrees to their infrastructure deal, DuPont will exclusively buy rubber only from Firestone's plantations, eschewing other competitors in the field. In exchange, DuPont will provide capital for the new highways, train networks, harbours, ports, and ships in tandem with Firestone's own contributions. One condition became paramount for DuPont: Firestone will only use its plants for rubber processing.\n\nWeeks passed, and talks whittled the terms into specifics. The consensus did not change."

Both the Iberian government and Leclerc's delegation have a vested interest in how their respective possessions in Africa are handled, albeit with some nuance.\n\nBoth sides have remained deadset in their opposition to anticolonial movements. This has made agreeing a fairly simple affair. Iberian diplomats were especially surprised at how fiery the French were given how indirectly they control their territory, yet it makes sense given their recent scuffle with pan-Africanism.\n\nLeClerc admitted that his government would be unable to maintain a direct hold over West Africa if they retake the mainland; they promised to do what they can to keep friendly governments in place so that both the Iberians and Free French can continue to have access to valuable West African Markets.\n\nWhile this is all dandy, the question of colonial claims is a little more tricky.

Rather than adhering to Gaullism the way Chaban-Delmas did, he prefers economic liberalism and the construction of a welfare-reinforced market economy.

To observe a nation like France -a former Pakt member, that is- have its old sins revisited upon it in the way it had was deeply compelling. To follow the French resistance grow from a revolutionary non-entity to a force capable of overtaking a European state was a sight to behold, made no less intriguing by the sheer uniqueness on display in front of him now.\n\nThe scene was a sight to behold; a street in Bordeaux practically alight with flames and bonfires stretching across the avenue. It was odd, because he knew it was exactly what most of his friends and family would kill to see- literally, for some of them. These fires weren't unattended, for a start, very much the opposite in fact. They were all surrounded by crowds, shovelling in nothing but red; Chris saw countless swastikas and even a few copies of Mein Kampf laying in the fires, though they were mostly flags of the old regime. That wasn't all Grisham saw, however. He also made out some other iconography, too, though it was all practically Greek to him- probably some obscure ideological niches. Even still, it was all so bizarre to him, like the French had gone ahead and absolved themselves of it all, and it certainly seemed like they knew it, too, if the cheering and laughing was anything to go by. Usually he would walk down and ask around for comments, but it was not that kind of night; the whole city was in a state of partying and celebration, like an anarchic festival, with burnings and public executions around any corner. Standing there on his balcony overlooking the whole affair, he began to feel a bit queasy.

Nearly 30 years, and he'd been stuck fighting underground for most of them since the establishment of Vichy. Some of those soldiers were with him through those years, like Pascal, who was a vineyard worker before joining the army. Then there was Jean, a young man born in Nice not 20 years ago, always hoping to serve his nation, and accomplish his father's dream; to start a family in Bordeaux once more. Then there was Phillipe, an aging artisan who fled the north not long ago, hoping to aid in liberation when the time came. Unfortunately for them, the four treacherous traitors led the resistance members to their certain doom. The walk felt abysmal for Maurice, like he was being pulled backwards with every step. There was little anyone could do in such a situation as this. Maurice thought he had felt hopelessness before, from the pits of the final days of official war, and perhaps he had, but then he was able to fight. Now, there was no such option. Throughout all that time, Maurice lived for his country, and sang its songs every morning to his son. And so, he already loved his country.\n\nIt began as a mumble, at least for a sentence or two, before everyone in the line realized he was singing \"La Marseillaise\". After a moment's hesitation, Pascal joined in. Their singing was cut short by a burst of machine gun fire tearing diagonally through Maurice's chest. Falling to the ground, the rest of the men froze, even the other captors. Jean was the first to sing again, then Phillipe, then the rest joined in. Again, gunfire overpowered their voices. As Jean fell onto Maurice's back, feeling his last breaths escape him, he muttered his final words to Maurice."

 france_reclamation.proxy.IBR.1.desc: "It was impossible to see the sun peeking out behind the horizon- it had been blocked by rows and rows of steel ships. Each ship defiantly waved the Free French Tricolor— a signal to the Collaborationists, and the Nazis along with them, that the rule of Vichy was no more. The ships had names such as Ramillies, Bonaparte, or Gaul- and they were staffed with more men than anyone could count.\n\nCountless thoughts ran through countless men's minds; countless emotions, countless faces, countless fears. The grin of Yves sat in stark contrast to the determined grimace of Muhammad- but both men's eyes were fixed on the horizon, on the coastline, on their home.\n\nFrance.\n\nIt called to them, like the cry of a mother beckoning them home. It sang to them, like an ancestral music they could not unhear. It commanded them, like a general they could not disobey. They followed France's command; they followed her home. Countless Napoleons return from their shared Elba.\n\nNot every ship was headed to the exact same location, of course; some were to land at \"Epee,\" \"Or,\" or \"Juno.\" But they each played a crucial part of the heated battle to come: the Reclamation of France, once and for all.\n\nAs the ships and landing craft approached the coast, as the planes dropped their parachute clad men, as the gunfire on the coast line roared, the rest of France held her breath. So many men, so many women, so many children had thought this day would never come, no matter how much they wished that it would. So many had been confident that it would, no matter how much they hoped it wouldn't. Countless televisions spewed their bile, their propaganda, unheeded; countless men and women, those who had been waiting in the shadows, returned to the light, rifle in hand."
