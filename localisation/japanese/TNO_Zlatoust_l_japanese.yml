Or all of it mattered. Voronin sure as hell didn't know anymore, as the caravan pulled into the snowy thicket.\n\nOut of the middle car stepped the certain Mr. Lagunov had been tasked with meeting the one he was meant to coordinate an arms deal with.

However, with Mayor-Consul Dragunov's expertise and wisdom, perhaps there is the chance that we can come to an agreement?\" Mikhail said.

That early morning, the few stars peaking through the rising sun's glare alongside the gentle falling snowflakes were not strong enough to pierce beauty through the grizzly sight of a blood-stained forest, as cloudy mists of Russian blood sprayed through the trees. There, deep within the Russian wilderness, Colonel Utkin found himself alive. His men, alive. And every single would-be marauder of his fine homestead and village on the run, or lying dead in the snow. Everyone stood silent, taking in their first victory in months, their first chance to make a stand against the Russian attacker who so greatly pillaged their lands for so long. The men threw down their rifles, hugged one another, and cheered to the heavens over their newfound victory against the murderous thieves who plagued them for so long. Colonel Utkin, however, took a minute to inspect the bodies. Boys, the least of which must have been sixteen. A prime age for cadets before the rise of the Soviets, perhaps, but the cold, lifeless eyes reminded him of that day when Russia would war no longer.\n\nCheers and cries greeted the party of guards as they entered their settlement once again, this time having tasted their first victory against the men who tore their land asunder for so long. However, whilst the rest of the men enjoyed family and the taverns, Colonel Utkin made his way up to his office, readying himself to congratulate the man truly in charge of their victory. Spinning the rotary, Colonel Utkin awaited.\n\n\"Yes, Mayor-Consul Dragunov? This is Colonel Utkin. I wished to report the lives you saved with your most recent transaction with our government...\""

Refugees flock to Zlatoust by the hundreds, fleeing the wrath of madmen, who swim like sharks around the mountain home, eager to rip it apart at any moment.\n\nRumours speak of giant caves, filled to the brim with intact weaponry and heavy equipment, enough to give their owner the edge against any force in Siberia. Unfortunately, there are also those who try to divide the root of Zlatoust's unnatural prosperity.

They shot at target dummies from a range of ~400 meters, and practiced hand-to-hand combat with one another in the evening.\n\nIt is my firm belief that this was not another roving band of mercenaries, as these soldiers exemplified discipline... but most importantly wielded modern weaponry. Private XXXXXXX had flanked this group, hoping to spy on it from the other side of the forest.

For a moment, Jaba thought that a mocking smile flashed across the head merchant's face. He gazed at the mountain trucks, equipped to pass through any kind of blizzard, while he, the most successful bandit in all of Russia, had to arrive on a horse.\n\nThe merchants had brought out three dozen crates of rifles, bullets, and some combat knives for the chiefs. Jaba took one of the guns, an old AK-47: its barrel was battered, but could get the job done. He turned his head and nodded to the bandits. They grabbed the crates and carried them off, not unlike how a vulture feasts on the scraps left by a fierce predator. In turn, some footpads emerged from a nearby bush with heavy sacks across their shoulders. They deposited these into the mountain trucks, then disappeared back into the woods.\n\nThe head trader returned a dry smile, reached into his overcoat and produced a letter. Jaba took it, but before he could open the seal the merchants had already started their engines.\n\nThe head trader yelled out: 'Zlatoust appreciates this deal, and we hope that many more will follow.

Two dozen men emerged, armed with modern assault-rifles and sporting gas masks never before seen in Siberia.\n\n\"We have come to see comrade Jaba!\" yelled one of the soldiers as he flung the gun over his shoulder.\n\n\"I'm Jaba.\" The bandit shoved some footpads aside as he made his way through the mud.

He raised his hand and a pack of mules emerged from the foliage, loaded with sacks of grain. The head merchant raised his eyebrows and stared at the animals, then drew a heavy breath and looked back at Jaba.\n\nThe man from Zlatoust eyed Jaba and his compatriots as they handed off the grain. \"Now, in order to secure trust in the dealings between the Republic and the Yugrans, we must understand a level of complete trust. We would like the rest, please.\" the Merchant said.

My messenger tells me that your illness has passed, so I believe it is time for me to relate to you the full story:\n\nAs you know, XXXXX clique had entruded upon our pastures last month, resulting in fifteen skirmishes between our forces and the loss of sixty-two brave men. Despite early promise, the enemy onslaught slowed down near Point XXXX Hill just a week ago, where casualties spiked.\n\nThe resolution originated with one XXXX XXX, who had arrived at our forward outpost in a model XX XXXX and claimed to be a representative of Zlatoust. He offered to mediate our dispute in exchange for XX bags of wheat. With Comrade XXXX's permission I accepted, and was later informed that XXXXX clique had been visited by the same man. He set up a meeting between our parties three days ago, where we had agreed to cede a quarter of the milk yielded by cows grazing on the contested pasture.\n\nIt is my firm belief that further cooperation with Zlatoust is preferable to continued border conflicts with our other neighbors.

So, when the merchants arrived, Jaba emerged from his hut, flanked by four guards, armed to the teeth with the most intimidating (and inefficient) equipment he could scavenge. It was a surprise when a single truck pulled into camp, and out came a single merchant, not of death but of opportunity. He seemed to sing when he spoke, yet his voice somehow managed to maintain integrity and directness. Jaba could only listen as the man made outrageous demands in exchange for nearly trivial promises, but portrayed them in such a way that would make a king understand. However, the deal boiled down to this:\n\nThe bandits are a brave bunch, but lack the numbers to protect their territories (and loot) properly. True, thought Jaba, there are occasional reports of thieves stealing from thieves. Therefore, Zlatoust is interested in offering protection for Yugra, but requires a simple favor: the allowance of its units to pass through bandit territory.

He had provided for them. Once, that had been enough, but now every time he closed his eyes, he saw flashes of muzzle fire and heard the thunderous report of the guns that bore his name. He had once been so proud of the AK-47. He still was on some days. It truly was a groundbreaking piece of weaponry, and he occasionally wondered what destructive muse must have been guiding his hands the day he drew up the first designs. Simple. Durable. Deadly.\n\nNo one would have guessed that a farmer's son from Altai would create the most important gun in Russian history, least of all himself.

Sometimes he wished he could push past the veil of time, grab that boy, and shout at him or warn him or plead with him to put the rifle away and never look back. He could have been a mechanic, or an engineer. He could have used his talents to design any number of other contraptions.

The Republic had recently repaired the railway from Nizhny Tagil, Mischa said, and that had to be the target.

As it turned out, however, they would never know.\n\nEmerging from the clouds above the German formation, a collection of small black dots dove onto the bombers, and as the friends heard the unmistakable sounds of machine-gun fire, and realized what was happening, they cheered. The Aviators were legends, avenging heroes that fought back not only against the Germans, but also against the hopelessness that was felt whenever the drone was heard.\n\nAs one of the bombers was rocked by an explosion, it began to rapidly descend, its angle growing steeper by the second until it was almost perpendicular to the ground. When it struck the ground, not far from the overhang, it was as if there had been a small earthquake.\n\nWhen the bombers, and the Aviators, had left, the group began running towards the crash site and saw others, some with weapons, doing the same.
