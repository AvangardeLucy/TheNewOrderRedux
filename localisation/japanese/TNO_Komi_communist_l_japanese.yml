 andropov.1.t: "スィクティフカルの夜更け"
 andropov.1.d: "ユーリ・アンドロポフは、タバコの吸殻を灰皿に怠そうに突っ込みながらため息をつき、興味なさげに小さなガラス容器の底に灰が落ちていくのを眺めていた。また今日も夜遅くまで執務室で過ごすことになった。窓を雨がポツポツと叩くため、彼の目は外の暗い蒸し暑いスィクティフカルの街並みに引き付けられた。彼は立ち上がってタバコを口にくわえながら、街を見渡した。今夜は静かな夜だ。彼の好みよりも静かすぎる。\n\n時々、若い共産党員たちが、ミハイル・スースロフの秘密主義、すなわちパラノイアについて呑気そうに互いに耳打ちしながら言及することがあった。彼らの愚痴るには、党は安全なところだそうだ。みんな同志のはずであると。ひょっとすると彼はもう少し緊張を解いてもよいかもしれない。\n\nいつも彼らは、ユーリに肩を叩かれて会議で意見を表明したいか聞かれると黙ってしまう。そして、党の真の影が誰なのかを知るのである。\n\nアンドロポフは、その時のことを思い出しながら、首を横に振った。彼の仕事は馬鹿な子供たちを怖がらせることだけではなかった。それは、党の安定を確保するために必要なことを行うこと、つまりスースロフの怒りを買った人物を消すことであった。ミハイルから渡された最新の調査対象者リストは、どれもあらゆる観点から見て退屈な人物ばかりだったが、一人の名前が彼の目を引いた。スヴェトラーナ・ブハーリナだ。\n\n何度か会ったことのある子だ、と彼は窓に煙を吹きかけながら思い出していた。彼女はユーリが想像するようなお姫様のような話し方をして、清楚で礼儀正しく、笑顔で握手をしてくれた。それで彼は彼女が危険な存在であることを見抜いた。彼女の父親もそうだった。味方である限りは素晴らしい男だったが、目の奥には毒が隠されており、彼は彼女の目の奥にも同じものを見たのである。\n\nユーリがリストを眺めていると、稲妻が街を照らした。一瞬ほとんど炎のように見えた。これはスヴェトラーナの力を示すものなのだろうかと彼は思った。\n\n彼は首を横に振って、タバコを灰皿に投げ捨てた。"

 andropov.2.d: "土砂降りの雨の中を歩いているユーリは、コートのポケットに手を突っ込んで暖をとろうとした。右手のポケットにいつも入っている銃のグリップにほとんど反射的に手が回った。彼はいつも少なくとも2つの武器を持ち歩いていた。ブーツにナイフ、ポケットにトカレフ。この街では、誰が自分を黙らせるために襲ってくるかわからないのだ。\n\nここ最近物事が昔よりもより速く動くようになった。確かにレーニンが言った通りだった。時には数週間のうちに数十年分のことが起こってしまう。あの子（ブハーリナだ、と自分で訂正した）は政治的な駆け引きに生意気なほど長けていた。わずか数週間の間に彼女は党内で急速に昇進し、無視できない権勢を誇るようになった。\n\n何かがユーリに、彼女の昇進がそこでは止まらないと告げていた。彼女は党内において、スースロフをますます心配させるような神通力のようなものを持っていた。ユーリの選択の根拠はそれだった。\n\n彼女に有利なことを書記長に吹き込んでおけば、彼女はもうしばらくは安全だろう。そしてユーリは、彼女がそれをうまく利用できるだろうと感じていた。いい投資である。\n\nしかし一方で、彼の中にはもうしばらく様子を見たほうがいいという気持ちもあった。もし彼の考えが正しければ、彼女は自力でスースロフのところまでたどり着けるはずだ。"

 andropov.3.t: "負け戦への挑戦"
 andropov.3.d: "Yuri Andropov was nothing if not a smart man, he reasoned with himself with some satisfaction; his hunch on Bukharina was certainly a correct one, hell, she had risen far beyond his expectations. Suslov hadn't seemed to worry about her growing beyond his control, but Yuri certainly had - and who was right in the end?\n\nA smirk crossed his lips as he trudged home. It had been a very productive meeting with several prominent 'revisionists', as Suslov would have called them. Yuri would have called them smart people. He wasn't exactly a bleeding heart when it came to how to best implement socialism, but he was a smart man.\n\nThese people were, whether he personally liked it or not, the future. Bukharina - hell, even Zhdanov, to some extent - they were the ones who were going to lead the Party to the future, not Suslov. Though they may have initially distrusted him as a hardliner, they certainly didn't after tonight.\n\nAndropov chuckled to himself. The game was afoot, and he certainly intended to pick a winning side."
 andropov.3.a: "Out with the old."
 andropov.4.t: "Check"
 andropov.4.d: "\"- I've seen the way the tide's turning, Comrade. There's no future in the past - but there is one with you.\"\n\nSvetlana Bukharina's eyebrow raised.\n\n\"While I'm glad you've seen the light, Comrade Andropov, you'll need for forgive me for my disbelief. You served as Suslov's attack dog for years. How can I trust you?\"\n\nAndropov shrugged. He expected the suspicion, and he had come prepared. From within his overcoat pocket he withdrew a small pocketbook and held it out to the woman. As she opened it, her eyes widened, and Yuri couldn't help but smile.\n\n\"All of your opponents' dirty little secrets. Things that'd surely turn the party against them if they somehow leaked.\"\n\n\"Comrade Andropov, I have the feeling this will be the start of a very beneficial friendship for the both of us.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Comrade Bukharina. I hope so.\""

And in your capacities as head of the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation, your duties will include ensuring the immediate cessation of counter-revolutionary activity wherever it may rear its ugly head, ensuring the safety of the Soviet State, and keeping the people safe from all other hidden threats. Do you understand, Comrade Andropov?\"\n\nYuri smiled. \"I do, Comrade Bukharina.\"\n\nThis was it, then. The bet he had made such a long time ago in Syktyvkar had finally paid off. From fixer to intelligence director. Not a bad career path, if he said so himself.\n\n\"Good,\" Bukharina continued. \"Then I believe we're done here.\"\n\nYuri moved to exit her office. \"And Yuri?\" She spoke as he left. He turned to face her, surprised to see a genuine smile spread across her face.\n\n\"Good luck.\"\n\nHe returned the smile with one of his own. Somewhere along the line they'd actually became friends, it seemed.\n\n\"You too, Comrade. You too.\""
 andropov.5.a: "Another win."
 bukharina.1.t: "The Victory of Reform"
 bukharina.1.d: "As she approached the microphone, Svetlana Bukharina suppressed a nervous tremble. It had finally happened. She had finally achieved what she had set out to do so long ago.\n\nAfter years spent in obscurity, after more spent concealing her ambitions from those who saw her as useful only for her name, and after yet more spent in the consolidation of Western Russia, she, and through extension the people, had triumphed. And she had no intention, of allowing the opportunities now offered to be wasted.\n\nWatching the technician carefully, she began speaking the moment he indicated that the microphone was active. She began by speaking of triumph, by thanking all those listening for their efforts - and sacrifices - in support of the state's victory. Very quickly, however, she moved to speak of what the future held. Of how she intended to change their lives for the better.\n\nSocialism, she said, rested at the natural apex of political thought, for it combined economic progress and collective human care. But all too often it had not been implemented in proper fashion. By her predecessors. By other so-called revolutionary states. By, she said with regret, of her father's Union. She intended to correct this.\n\nProgressive economic and social policies were to be soon introduced, and those obstructing such reform would be swept aside. Equality, of all kinds, would be emphasized, continuing the legacy of some who had come long before and ensuring that Russia was known as a champion of equitable action.\n\nChange, she promised those listening, was imminent. They needed only to watch, and reap the rewards besides."
 bukharina.1.a: "A new day for true socialism."
 bukharina.2.t: "The Selection Process"
 bukharina.2.d: "Bukharina is a woman of measured and deliberate tones, but the exhaustion in her voice is all too real as she begins the announcement. So, too, is her triumph. The Congress of the Soviets has been formed, the long struggle over who to select and who to reject for the Presidium finished. It is coming to a close, at long last, and the business of real governance can truly begin.\n\nHer hand trembles as she reads aloud the words, each blending into the next, and the Congress registers her candidates with polite and faceless nods. A unionist here. A politician there. A general or two thrown in for diversity's sake. She can't quite remember the specifics of everything anymore - her head is trembling with the effort necessary to stand as it is - but what she does know is that while she was still lucid, she had taken measures to build the broadest possible base.\n\nShe will not repeat the mistakes of her father. Never again will Russia crumble from the errors of a few.\n\nShe stumbles, almost trips and falls. Panic echoes through the Congress, and guards stand to help her up. She waves them off - a leader always stands up before her people, she thinks - and resumes reading. A police officer, one of the few good ones, she thinks, and she's finished at last. Polite applause comes as her speech ends. She staggers out of the podium, stumbles into her seat and takes a long, long swing of the devil's brew.\n\nShe barely has time to let it down her throat when the first rejection comes. The unionist is a good choice, yes, but according to the remarks he made to a speech in so-and-so factory, his allegiances to independent unionism are rather in doubt. And as for his own capacities to build the Revolution, has the Chairwoman not noticed his work with so-and-so employers?\n\nBukharina stares blearily into the Congress, head unbowed. Something raw and primal inside her wants to burst into a long, silent scream, and in the spaces of her head, she indulges it."
 bukharina.2.a: "I hate bureaucracy."
 bukharina.3.t: "Soviet Humanism"
 bukharina.3.d: "Despite the many questions being asked of him, the professor remained patient and composed. He could not blame the students for their confusion. After all, like them, he too had been removed from academia for many, many years, having only returned with the imposition of renewed order.\n\nAs he answered another such question, he took care to emphasize the importance of the 'Soviet' in the all-important concept of Soviet Humanism. The distinction was critical, he announced to the lecture hall, and could not be overlooked, at least if one were to truly understand the system.\n\nHumanism, he declared, was well-understood to represent the belief in promotion of human agency, and of the inherent value of every human being. But it had also traditionally been defined through a non-socialist lens, with the position of that agency within hierarchies - political or ecclesiastical - being a subject of intense focus. And this acceptance of such a social construct was inherently divisive. Inherently destructive.\n\nSoviet Humanism accounted for this, and in doing so, elevated the philosophy tremendously. By eliminating religious considerations, emphasizing egalitarian social policy, and reorienting the lens from external hierarchies and factors to internal improvement, within both the individual and the state as a whole, it promised progress on a scale never before seen.\n\nIt promised to, truly and finally, place humanity at the forefront of thought. Who, the professor asked, could possibly argue against such a goal? With conviction of any kind?\n\nAt that, there were no more questions."
 bukharina.3.a: "An achievable goal?"
 bukharina.4.t: "In All Things, Equal"
 bukharina.4.d: "Occasionally, when Marianna had the time and her overseer wasn't looking, she'd slip away to a place she knew: the industrial floodlights shone on almost everything, but they hid certain alleys with their bulk just as easily. There she would read, page after page, the works that kept her alive. Her parents had died young, and all she'd known as she grew to adulthood was this: fluorescent lighting, endless queues of machinery and the quiet sorrow of being alive.\n\nBut Kollontai's words kept her going. There was a fire in them, an inexpressible celebration, that let Marianna know who she really was: in her words, for the first time in what had been an otherwise utterly unnoticed life, she felt heard. When her supervisor ignored her pleas for paid overtime, when her colleagues snickered at her slower pace and tentative moves, when she was tired, abandoned and so alone it hurt -\n\nShe would run to her hiding place, flip to the page, so well-browsed it was fastened to the spine by sheer willpower, and read the words, \"Certainly not the woman worker. She is her own savior. Her future is in her own hands.\" She read it over and over and over again. Occasionally tears would slip out and dry on the smoothed, weathered paper, like little blossoms. Then she would return to her workplace, her pain seemingly cast aside.\n\nWhen the Soviet Representative came to the factory, she was ready. Scarcely had the words Marxist Feminism flowed from the Representative's mouths when she rose to speak, talking almost too fast for comprehension. She spoke of the need of her fellow workers to fight alongside her, not undercut her position, and as she spoke she almost wept with the relief.\n\nIn the silence that followed, she packed her things with trembling hands left the factory. For the first time in years, she knew what she had to do. She began walking, not quite sure where she would go but certain she was headed for a better place."
 bukharina.4.a: "The liberation, in the end, was her own."
 bukharina.5.t: "A Principled Response To Gender Revisionism"
 bukharina.5.d: "Socialist Workers! We have heard the cries of the Revisionist in our struggle to build a world for the Dignity of the Proletarian. The Revisionist says one of three things; FIRST, that women are physically incapable; SECOND, that women are emotionally hysterical; THIRD, that to embrace equality would ruin our traditions. Let us consider the following:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we argue that women are NO MORE physically incapable than are men! Women are rarely seen in manual labor because they have NOT been given the chance to work outside the home; indeed, raising a home with little support from a husband can be oppression in itself!\n\nTO THE SECOND, we reply that women are, far from hysterical, the more composed sex. Was Hitler not a male? It was under the charge of MALE leaders, not female, that the world was swept in war and horror; and it was under the Bourgeois Dictatorship of the Intellect that the world LEARNED to associate Maleness with Wisdom, and Femaleness with Chaos. This is oppression in itself!\n\nTO THE THIRD, we retort that the same traditions that give Russia its 'values' have led it into error, again and again! Because Russia loved the Tsar, it SLAVERED before his gaze and expected reprieve from the First War, and was shocked when the Tsar answered their begging with BULLETS. Because Russia loved tradition, it hesitated when the clarion call came to build itself up with the rest of the World, and for it, we were CRUSHED as Hitler's savages came for us. Our infatuation with tradition will lead us to embrace only the GRAVE!\n\nComrades! You have heard the call for Revolution - let us obey, and fight to the end against all the shackles that Reactionism imposes upon us! Modernity, and the Classless Future, awaits the brave!"
 bukharina.5.a: "Reject Tradition! Embrace Modernity!"
 bukharina.6.t: "A Principled Response To The Crypto-Orthodox"
 bukharina.6.d: "Socialist Workers! We have heard the cries of the hidden Counter-Revolutionaries that call themselves NICODEMITES, the hidden Christians. The Nicodemite claims three defenses: FIRST, that the Orthodox Church must be preserved to keep Russia blessed by God; SECOND, that the Church contains many within its walls that are innocent; THIRD, that the tearing down of churches will destroy our cultural heritage. Let us consider:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we respond that the so-called 'PRESERVATION' of Russia's Church led to its near defeat in the Great War, and has done nothing for us since the release of the SERFS! Religion is an OPIATE of the masses, and our duty as class-conscious workers is to WAKE the masses from their drugged slumber. For that is worth any amount of forfeited 'blessings'!\n\nTO THE SECOND, we demand a retraction of this INSULT to our workers. Our Workers' Battalions are imbued with the most HUMANE of class values, and would gladly give their lives for the defense of the INNOCENT. They attack only the hidden predators of the working class, who ABSCOND with the wealth of the masses in the name of religion! Those who are not enemies of the workers have nothing to fear!\n\nTO THE THIRD, we call only for a demonstration of the so-called VALUES these Churches preserve! Do the accumulated wealth and power accrued by the PRIESTS not indicate that, far from being our moral guardians, the Church has in fact acted as our collective RACKETEERS? Let us be AWARE, comrades! The Church cares nothing for tradition, nor for the soul - unless one's soul is contained within one's WALLET!\n\nComrades! The State has called for Revolution, and let us unceasingly vie to outdo each other in zeal to fulfil the mandate! Destroy the strength of this accumulated REACTIONARY force, and let the Revolution emerge as our true and better Salvation!"

The Working Oppressor, for that is his name, claims that: FIRST, that the women involved are willing to wear face-veils; SECOND, that removing these veils will scare their husbands and fathers from socialism; THIRD, that socialism is not incompatible with the wearing of veils. Consider:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we have only SCORN for the fools and dullards who believe these women are not COERCED. The reactionary apparatus HYPNOTIZES innocent women into SELF-VICTIMHOOD - that is precisely why they struggle with us when we RIP the illusions from their faces! Let us ceaselessly destroy their illusions - when they come to their senses, they will THANK us.\n\nTO THE SECOND, we are UTTERLY CONTEMPTUOUS of the idea that these so-called \"swinging socialists\" would ever be pure enough for the REVOLUTION in the First Place. Our creed calls for the SELF-CRITICISM of every aspect of their reactionary lives, and yet it is the removal of some SENSELESS VEILS that destroys the fabric of their communities! Only their extirpation and assimilation into the Enlightened Proletariat will suffice for an answer.\n\nTO THE THIRD, we answer only with DISGUST! If you have not understood that socialism demands the total extinction of reactionary traditions, you have understood NOTHING about socialism at all! For these senseless fools it is worse to work with than to fight, for they will actively undermine your cause: RESIST them and DRAG them to their SENSES!\n\nNo matter if the Government disagrees with us, the Immortal SCIENCE of Marxism shows us the WAY!"

These calls for SENSELESS assaults on veil-wearing masses can only DESPOIL the image of the Revolution here and abroad, and will do NOTHING for our Revolutionary Struggle! Let us be measured in our zeal, and let us be prescient in our vision.\n\nHENCEFORTH, assaults on veil-wearing women will be deemed COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY by Decree, and the RADICALS that espouse such a monstrous, dehumanizing treatment will be CHARGED BY COMMON LAW.

 bukharina.9.d: "The Working World had not been easy on Officer Tabashnikov. Life in the Republican Police had been a constant struggle from beginning to end - struggles against internal corruption, struggles with his bosses over funding and manpower, struggles with the men on the street who didn't understand that he was doing what he was doing to keep them safe. Of course, the rabble didn't know how much it cost, or the sleepless nights he endured, but that was why they were rabble, weren't they?\n\nIt came as a dull surprise to him when the Revolution reached his home in scarlet banners, but he supposed he'd gotten lucky. There had been little that changed: he reported now to a Commissar instead of a Boss, and his deputies greeted each other with Comrade instead of their first names, and there was talk of hiring a woman - a woman! - in the branch someday. Nothing else had changed. Why would it?\n\nEverything began to crumble when the order came in from Central. President's orders were to release everything in a comprehensible format. Nice, safe and orderly. Well, Tabashnikov knew then that he had to be the one to review his own records. It was the only way to preserve his skin - and his service to the people. Too much lay in the balance to risk it. He gave strict orders to his secretary to lock the records down and left for the weekend, to settle accounts.\n\nHe forgot, of course, that his deputies had been appointed to the task as well - and that they had been granted equal access with the very same decree that had opened the records.\n\nAs Tabashnikov returned, he found his deputies staring at him with something between disgust, fear and pity on their faces - and a cold-faced bureaucrat with a very, very unamused expression. He began to wonder if the jail cell would have hot or cold running water - very soon, he suspected, his hide would be too whipped to tell."

He'd done too much to risk it all, but it wouldn't matter if his own subordinates proved a weak link.

Assured, by the Chief of the Police, that they posed no threat to our security. What was I given for my assurance?\" She placed another binder upon the table; this one landed like a feather, but none dared look at its contents - precisely because they already knew what it was.\n\nThe President moved past the dizzying heights of rage and took flight into the rarefied heights of cold, calm fury. The room fell even more silent than it had previously been. Several staffers made motions to escape for a toilet break, fleeing at the minutest of nods.\n\n\"I am only going to ask this once. Can I be assured that no such attacks will happen again?\" The Chief of Police's averted gaze told her all she needed to know. \"Very well. I had wanted to avoid this unpleasantry, but we cannot afford to have this despoil the Revolution. Gather the Directorate for Revolutionary Preservation and call the Head of the Presidium to my office.\"\n\nUpon her lips was affixed something that looked like a smile, and yet was so utterly constricted it looked more like a particularly painful rictus. Her secretary nodded, only barely suppressing her trembling, and made a careful note upon her calendar.\n\n\"You are dismissed. Do not return unless I call.\" As the gathered staff dispersed into the depths of the Chamber, Bukharina collapsed into herself, listening only to the guilt that burrowed deep into her heart and cradling her tea-flask."

What they did next would make them all monsters in equal measures. There would be blood enough to share.\n\nClearing her throat, she rose to speak. \"I have called you here today in view of your oath. When you were sworn into office in your capacities, I asked of you the strength and resolve to defend the Revolution by any means necessary. Even if it meant a suspension of - formalities and conventions that others could afford, but we could not.\"\n\nShe looked down. \"That moment has now arrived.\"\n\nAgain she looked up, and the doubt was gone. Iron, and the fire that lit it, were all that remained. \"We had previously agreed to an informal armistice with the Suslovite and Zhdanovite elements in our Republic and legislature, for the sake of the Nation and the Revolution we embodied. This armistice is henceforth suspended. All necessary measures are to be taken to remove them - social circles and sympathizers are to be considered complicit.\"\n\nA tentative voice rose from the rear. \"Are you suggesting the use of unlimited interrogation?\"\n\nUnder Bukharina's desk, a hand-knotted and torn strip of paper was kneaded and thrown aside.

In the blackest hours of the morning, when only cleaning crews and the on-duty URS agents were present, they always shone so beautifully - a perfect complement to the friendly smell of the teacup on her desk, and the sweet, romantic jazz that the record player was playing. In her way, this was her personal paradise - alone, peaceful, and victorious, lounging in her chair in a way that she would never allow to be photographed. It was the calmest part of the week - the time that she had to herself, to sit in her solitary office and get a few minutes of reflection and relaxation.\n\nMoving her feet off of the desk's surface, and swiveling the chair around, she looked back out the half-shuttered window once more. In the distance, red fireworks were being fired off - celebrations by her supporters, no doubt, of the final neutralization of the sadly misguided opposition. Their own Victory Day. It was a gesture she approved of, privately. Celebration, making a positive example - those who tragically resisted progress would eventually come around, exposed to the joy and community of true progressive society. Repression past a certain point would merely lead their ideals to form their metaphorical fortresses.\n\nShe took a sip of tea and closed her eyes, moving a single finger in the air as if conducting the music.

I knew from the way you spoke, as if half your body was in some far-off realm high above, that you were involved in something that I dared not name, for fear it would sweep me away, too.\n\nI had never expected this. Piece by piece I was drawn with you - drawn by you, rather - into a web of lies, deceit, layer upon layer of hidden truths, and I accepted it because I wanted so desperately to believe in what you said. The Special Section of the Directorate, the Mission - you said Bukharina needed people to defend her, that the Left needed nightwatchmen, to protect it from the monsters in the night. Even as I began to see more than just money in the invoices I signed in my name for you, I believed in what you said.\n\nI see now that the only menace Bukharina needed protection from was your merry band. How could I possibly have ignored the invoices to Suslov? And as you smiled at me and promised that your alliance was nothing but a red herring, were you really thinking of me? Of us?\n\nKnow this, Anton Aronovich Pachikov. I stared into your eyes, so deep and rich like endless golden fields, as the red banners fluttered around us, and you promised never to leave me. I wish I had never swept into your arms. I wish I had never known you at all. And I cannot, no matter how painful it is to remember you, cast you aside. I will ask you one last time.\n\nAre you truly a Suslovite mole? Did what we shared mean nothing to you? Please, tell me. I will never see you again.

 bukharina.17.t: "The Gender Equality Commission"
 bukharina.17.d: "The chairman of the Commission had seemed like an odd choice at first glance. Why had Bukharina chosen such an innocuous young woman, with little experience and even less credentials within the Party, to lead the work? The Chairwoman was seldom accused of political interference, but there were outright rumours of corruption swirling around the woman from the start; the choice was so unexpected, it was hard to believe it had not been planned.\n\nWhen the Commission's first meeting kicked off, however, all doubts were dispelled. The woman, introduced only as Comrade Ekaterina, outlined an agenda so ambitious and detailed it could only have come from a consummate political operative. In days she pushed through a proposal outlining radical changes to women-specific wage rate laws and housing specifications, and within weeks it was on the floor of the Congress of the Soviets.\n\nEkaterina brought the Commission to vibrant action in other ways, too: it was quickly discovered that her connections to industry players had bought them all a window into the closed spaces of the business world. A dinner meeting became a formal invitation, and then spiraled into a full-blown conference complete with research initiatives. It was a dream come true for the Committee's members: it seemed that the sky was the limit with this mysterious young woman.\n\nAlthough most never thought to question the Committee Head, one member was not so naive. As Ekaterina was packing her things in the meeting room one evening, the Party Operative approached her and whispered that she knew who Ekaterina was - or at least who she had worked with. Industry access. Windows to all the spheres of government. Secret projects that appeared and disappeared at will. Only one ghost remained this influential in the Republic.\n\nEkaterina chuckled, and whispered to her: \"Suslov is dead. I, however, am very much alive.\" Then she was gone, leaving only a scattering of notes in her wake."

 bukharina.19.d: "Medvedev was waiting for her outside, with all the patience of your average bodyguard. As she stepped into the waiting station-wagon, she whispered, \"Is the perimeter secure?\" He stiffened, nodded. \"Well then, let's get this evening underway.\" He nodded again, ever the gentleman, and gestured for her to get in. Bukharina chuckled a little to herself - here she was, the most powerful person in the Republic, being taken for a drive.\n\nWell, she couldn't complain too much. It was the Workers' Liberation Day, after all.\n\nThere were fireworks illuminating the town banners as the station-wagon plodded its way into the Central District of Sykvytkar. Bukharina could only wince: poor old Karby would have his feathers scared stiff, if he didn't outright die of shock.\n\nMedvedev simply sighed. \"A man of my age, dragged around in a glorified trolley. What would my wife say about all this?\" As Bukharina chuckled, he went on. \"You know, Svetlana, I never thought we'd get this far. Those early days in the Assembly, when we were just note-passers talking over teatime and gossiping - who'd ever have thought it?\"\n\nThe iron in her voice must have surprised him, which was slightly disappointing in itself. \"I've always thought it, Roy. Never stopped believing in it. It was inevitable - all we had to do was work for it, no matter the cost. No matter the price.\" She looked out at the swarms of workers heading to the celebration. \"You've always been loyal, for which I thank you. But loyalty isn't enough if you want to build the future.\"\n\nThe station-wagon pulled up to the packed stadium, and the tunes of The Sacred War blared through the windows. Bukharina smiled, almost conspiratorial, and opened the door for him. \"You also have to fight, Roy,\" she called, but the fireworks blotted out the sound, and she couldn't be sure Medvedev heard it at all."

 bukharina.20.d: "Yuri Andropov had never been comfortable with fine food. He could never quite bring himself to focus on dietary extravagance, not when there was talking to be done and people to be scanned. Bukharina was evidently a woman of similar tastes: gazing around the spartan confines of the cafe, if it could be called that, Yuri admitted that it was exactly as proletarian as he'd imagined the Chairwoman would like.\n\nSvetlana looked up from her plate, shooting a quizzical gaze. \"Enjoying the food? I suppose we could have chosen a better establishment.\"\n\nYuri shrugged. \"Truth be told, Madame Bukharina, it's all the same to me. I don't care much for affairs of the palate these days.\" The conversation trailed off, stillborn, and for a long while the two ate in silence.\n\nBukharina pushed her plate away. \"I've noticed the Directorate's latest reports on loyalty in rank-and-file unions. Very well written, I'd have struggled to do better myself.\" Yuri tilted his head a little in acknowledgement, but said nothing.\n\nThe Chairwoman raised her cup to her lips, so what she said next could be heard clear in the echo. \"Are there similar concerns with the leadership of the Directorate?\" The glint on the cup was unnaturally bright. Yuri put the flash of light before him and the open window about two meters away together and chuckled to himself. The kid was growing fangs.\n\n\"I do not believe so, Chairwoman.\" Of course, now the game was up the pistol in her handbag seemed almost gauche. But it was a good effort from an amateur. Perhaps she would have made as good an operative as she was a politician.\n\n\"My apologies, Chairwoman. I must leave for business. Enjoy your meal.\" Yuri leaned close and whispered: \"And get your sniper to blur his scope a little, it was painfully obvious. Even so, a good effort, yes?\" Then he was gone, leaving a flustered Chairwoman to pack up their lunch and her dignity."

 bukharina.21.d: "\"I admire your work with the All-Russian Workers' Association, Comrade.\" Bukharina is, at last, in her element - not in the offices, not even giving speeches, but here, in the midst of the workers. Like a fish to water, she thinks. \"In fact, I believed I've given a speech at your employer's headquarters - regarding the necessity of a perpetual revolutionary mindset in the promotion of employees. Were you in attendance?\" The bashful unionist nods, and Bukharina flashes one of her brighter smiles.\n\n\"Then I believe you know my stance on the matter of workplace hierarchies. Thank you very much for your work, Comrade.\" She pats her on the shoulder and moves to the next one. A member of the River-Fishermen Association, she believes - their long-chaotic state of logistics has put them in close association with the Congress, and she gets his name on sight. \"Ah, Yerik!\" A pause, he widens his eyes, and Bukharina moves in for the kill. \"Such a pleasure to see you again. I hope the assistance we've granted your workingmen has proven of use...\"\n\nYerik chuckles. \"Yes, it's been something of a struggle. I suppose you're no better off, Chairwoman Bukharina. This - \" He gestures at the crowd arraigned around them, a gauntlet of eager faces and good cheer. \"This must be all very daunting for you, yes?\"\n\nBukharina looks confused for a moment, but she's never been one to lose composure. \"Ah, pardon me. I was taken quite by surprise at your question - but to answer it, no, this is like breathing to me. Unconscious, I suppose - perhaps I just like slacking off.\" She chuckles, and subconsciously checks her timing. God, has that put her off schedule? There's a meeting in the evening, and Medvedev will kill her if she's out of sorts. \"My apologies, I really must be going now. I wish you the best of luck with your resolution process!\"\n\nAs Bukharina turns to leave, Yerik calls out, \"Try not to collapse with the energy, Madame Chairwoman!\" She shouts something in return, but the crowd swallows her noise in its own clamor, and she isn't quite certain he hears."

 bukharina.24.d: "Grigori glared at the Unionist and the massive, canvas-draped bulky - thing - behind him. \"Give me one reason why I shouldn't throw this thing off our property right now.\" In all his years on the farm he'd worked through a half-dozen beasts of burden, all of them annoyances in the flesh, but this was quite something else altogether.\n\nThe Unionist simply nodded eagerly. \"This machine has been sent to your town by direct order of the Agrarian Advancement Council - approved by the Chairwoman herself.\" He spoke the last clause with near-reverence. Grigori's already low assessment of the man plummeted still further. He hated blind worshippers of things - God, the Republic, this Chairwoman character (had he even voted for her?), and most of all the metal machines that now raked his neighbours' fields.\n\nGod, how he hated them! Not that he believed in God, but the intensity seemed only fitting. The Bocharovs and their gas-guzzling abomination - he'd been grilling something in his yard when the stench hit, and the cutlet had never recovered. He'd never give in to their monstrosities!\n\nThe Unionist, hearing all this, shrugged sagaciously. \"My orders are simply to pass this to you, Mister Grigori. What you choose to do with it is your own business.\" With that he walked away, and Grigori sighed as he began the mental calculus of fitting this within an already crowded homestead.\n\nThe next morning, he rose to find a flat canvas in his backyard and a distant whirring. Looking up, he was horrified to see young Andrei whooping as he cleared a month's worth of harvest in minutes, waving his hand like a cattle-herder.\n\nGrigori kneaded his temples. He could feel a fierce headache brewing already."

 bukharina.26.d: "They watch the stars together in the night, the four of them: as a child Kristina had always wanted to watch the stars with her own parents, and she's made it a point to give her own children every opportunity. They're silent for awhile before the Great Belt and the sky, unbounded and brilliant. A view like this could swallow the entirety of one's mind.\n\nKristina breaks the silence. \"I didn't hear about your school today, Sacha.\" He's off to that technical school these days, although she isn't quite sure what that means. \"What are you learning these days? Are they going through History again?\"\n\nSacha shakes his head, reluctant. Perhaps it's teenage bravado or rebelliousness. Kristina hardly minds, but she'd like a straight answer - she nudges Dmitry, who rouses himself as from a slumber. \"Yes, Sacha, are you doing well for History these days?\" In response to her mild frown, Dmitry only shrugs. A father can only do so much.\n\n\"I'm not taking history this semester. We're doing machine-work.\"\n\nThe parents' eyebrows rise in unison. Machine work, so far out in the farmlands? Has the Republic finally gone mad? \"That's nice to hear, Sacha. What are they making you do?\"\n\nHis initial answer is drowned out by little Timofey's burbling, and Sacha fusses over the child as he continues. \"We do - it's hard to describe. Pressers, I guess? They press metal into sheets. We do work on a central lathe, that's what it's called - we drill holes and cut the metal into shapes. They'll fit in everything from tractors to planes, or that's what Teacher says.\"\n\nDmitry nods. \"That's good, son. If you can work one of those machines, maybe you'll help repair the combines we use someday. Then you can use that as an excuse to be sweet on the Kalinka girl from across the street, yes?\" Sacha scowls and makes to throw a reed of grass at him, and the family shares a chuckle, there under the light of distant and wondrous stars."

 bukharina.27.t: "Drastic Measures"
 bukharina.27.d: "A knock on the door in the waning hours of the afternoon, during the preparations for dinner, was not what Vasily expected out of his Friday. Nevertheless, he checked the loophole on the door... and recoiled.\n\nA stern-looking man of the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation stood on the wooden step up, escorted by two more officers carrying ominous black briefcases, and an armored personnel carrier which idled ten meters away. He wanted to run, right then and there, but the door was the only entrance to his modest home, and it was locked down tightly. Were they here for him? Had they learned about the alcohol relabelling? He swallowed, nervously, and looked to his left, where the two children, Ivan and Katya, were washing the pots. He thought about calling out to them, but couldn't. If this new Directorate were anything like the Okhrana that had been active here since mere years ago... with nerveless fingers, he pulled the latch. The door swung open, and he retreated as far as he could against the wall.\n\nThe first officer crossed the threshold, carrying something concealed in his long coat. Katya jumped and hid behind her brother. His head swiveled towards Vasily, and he gestured, bringing three more people inside. Vasily's eyes widened in shock.\n\nChairwoman Svetlana Bukharina stepped into his humble home, with a hand on her black brimmed hat. In one hand, she held a book. In the other, a pen. Ivan looked down, cried out and dropped the pan that he was carrying at sight of the pistol on her belt. She did not waste a moment, placing the book on the table as the URS officers stacked their cases next to it.\n\n\"Comrades!\", she recited, as if she had done it a thousand times before. \"We are here to liquidate you!\"\n\nAnother cry from Katya was quickly cut off by the lead URS man, who opened his case. The children were just too far away, separated from him by four well-armed people. Vasily braced himself for the cruel gunshots, closing his eyes."

 bukharina.271.t: "Liquidation"
 bukharina.271.d: "Nothing happened, for what felt like an eternity. He hesitantly opened his eyes, expecting the worst.\n\nInstead of his own gun, the URS officer who had knocked on the door was now holding another book out in his hand, offering it to him. The other officers, and the Chairwoman, stood next to the table, reaching into the black cases. At a glance, he noticed that the pistols were gone, replaced by books and writing utensils.\n\nHe took the book from the officer, gingerly, before trying to flatten himself against the wall even more. It was useless to him, but perhaps obeying could get him out unharassed, without the unexpected quartet looking under the floorboards. Bukharina placed her book on the table, smiling to the children, before speaking.\n\n\"I apologize for the unexpected visit, comrades,\" she begun, before presenting a piece of paper with some illegible text on it. \"This village has been marked as the next stop for the liquidation of rural illiteracy. Has the local council informed you of your local liquidation point?\"\n\nThe children tentatively inched towards the door. Vasily blinked once, uncomprehending. Did that mean- this was all an overly-threatening entrance for what he understood as a political reading group? The seeds of a chuckle escaped his mouth, to be strangled in a moment by anxiety. Sensing that compliance was the way out, he let himself begin to form words.\n\n\"I- No. No, Comrade Chairwoman.\", he said.\n\nBukharina nodded, slightly.\n\n\"Your locality has assembled a center in the back room of the town hall. My sincere apologies for the lack of notification. I am honored to welcome you to attend in person.\"\n\nAs they began to pass out books to the children, all Vasily could do was nod politely, and take one himself. He could not understand the cover.\n\nHopefully, he thought, keeping with the program of compliance, that would soon change."

 bukharina.28.d: "Leonid was perceptive for his age, and so he was the first to notice that something seemed - odd - about the recent lessons. They seemed to switch in focus and methodology almost every half-semester, and the teachers were looking ever more frazzled. He'd even been earmarked for speaking too much in class! While Leonid was as guilty as any prankster his age, he at least knew to act innocent when the class was looking. No, something had to be going on.\n\nHe whispered it to his little clique during lunch, for at their age it was almost taboo to ever confess a great fear to the Adults. Gazing around with all the grizzled intensity of a hardened conspiracist, he admitted: \"I think there's something going on in our school. There's been a lot of changing around these parts.\"\n\nPetrov giggled. \"Surely you must be joking. In our school? Nothing ever happens here. If anything, we're getting dumber for every day we attend it.\" Vadim nodded, ever the follower. But Leonid was insistent, as with all young prophets.\n\n\"No, you're not getting it. Think about it: when was the last time you got a test back?\" Silence around the table. \"Exactly. We keep changing our lesson formats, too. When we were suddenly speaking up in class a lot, six months ago, Old Ms Adrianna called for us to sit still and keep quiet. Then Ms. Sakharova told us that, you know, we should try this new drawing-thing? Charts?\"\n\nVadim piped up. \"Yes! I loved that part! Shame they switched right back to reading. I hate long words.\" He pouted, and the group shared a moment of silence for his loss.\n\n\"Anyway, something's wrong. But I don't know what to do about it.\" Leonid shrugged, and his face brightened a little. \"But hey, I guess there's a bright side to everything, yes? If they keep changing the classes, our homework doesn't matter so much either.\" He smiled. \"And that means we can go play with Misha the Alsatian after school. Who's with me?\""

 bukharina.29.d: "Chairwoman Bukharina was, in truth, something akin to the thick coat Svetlana would wear in a particularly harsh blizzard. Svetlana Bukharina was for the most part at ease in the Chairwoman's coat, but it was never a perfect fit, and often an uncomfortable one. At moments of stress, doubt or fear she withdrew to her home and the comfort of Karby, where the voices and the endless expectant gazes could be dispelled for at least a few hours.\n\nNow she gazed upon the preening bird, her eyes unfocused and dull, her mind elsewhere altogether. She was, in her mind's eye, leaving through the brief history of her interactions with Suslov. An impromptu alliance here, a common resolution there. In truth, the two had never shared much in common despite their common cause, and the days when they had fought under the same banner seemed increasingly distant. A mirage through a telescope of time.\n\nWith some effort she wrested her attention to the present, and the letter awaiting her. She had no real desire to open it, because she knew how it read. The inevitable had come to pass. On the envelope was marked the words, SUSLOV - CONTINGENCY PLAN: VERMILLION RAT. In it were details of the operation that would remove her greatest remaining political opponent in the Republic. She'd been in the briefing herself: this last letter was merely a formality. All it would take was a stamp and a signature, and the paralysis of the Left in the Republic would come to an end.\n\nSo why did her hands tremble so as she thought? No, she felt no real remorse: she knew what had to be done. It felt...wrong, like cutting the last strings to one's anchor. And, in truth, Suslov was nothing without his supporters. Would a little mercy be too much to spare? Karby shrieked, and Bukharina rushed to soothe her feathers. She stood there, gently patting the bird, for a long time, the decision crystallizing in her head."

The funny thing was that it really wasn't that different from the work he'd done in his cavorting with Suslov: one glanced through dossiers, picking apart the details of someone's life and family and career, and at the end one made a choice. If the choice was positive, Andropov would add it to the large pile on the left: if not, to the small, neat and alphabetically arranged stack on the left. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAndropov had once made the mistake of talking to a priest about his line of work; the latter had mumbled something about the sheep and the goats, and then he'd retreated. Well, even without having read the Good Book Andropov knew what he was on about. His job was essentially that of a judge: the good and the bad, the assets and the liabilities. The quick and the dead.\n\nAnd there had been so very many of the latter in recent days, Yuri mused. For some reason Headquarters was sending over requests at a vastly increased rate, even compared to the early days of the Revolution. They were lucky that the Directorate had recently gotten a wave of new recruits. This stack had been the result of what he estimated to be three months' worth of labor. Otherwise...well, no Revolutionary state had survived the collapse of its security apparatus.\n\nA staffer poked his head out the side of the door, yelling: \"Director Andropov! There's a fresh stack of work for you down the hall!\"\n\nAndropov stretched his sore back, hiding a wry smile. The visionaries all sounded different, but his unceasing labor was, in the end, the same under every one of them. Well, he supposed, there was one factor which had changed."

Lost in her idle reverie, she barely registered the sound of the door opening.\n\n\"Chairwoman?\" Her secretary called, leaning out from outside.

From afar, he made insights into people's lives - most would call it slander. Perhaps it was insensitive, but Alexei didn't see any harm in the matter. He blew into the whistle, and fifty people began to cross the street. The man in the fedora over there probably likes to play the harp. The woman in the red blazer likes her tea with milk for some strange reason. The two teen boys over there holding hands -\n\nWait a damn minute. They were holding hands. People could do that now?

No matter what the radio says in the coming days or weeks, I know the Muslim community here. We have always had faith in God to preserve us - you know that we are not violent people. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nWhat we believe may soon be irrelevant, however. Already the Government has issued another of their foul Revolutionary Directives to begin 'investigations' into the death, and the neighbours of the flat I am staying in have been questioned several times in the last week. And there is more, too: they are actively removing those that still wear the veils. Yes, women are being accosted on the street for the crime of following what they believe. Is this the socialist culture we were told would set us free?\n\nIt is not safe for us here, not anymore, and I know that you are a loyal servant. You, too, will not long survive the Government's anger. Pack your suitcase, my love: we must flee from the cities until this latest transgression is forgotten.

 bukharina.47.t: "Bukharina's Reforms"
 bukharina.47.d: "With our recent gains of territory, Bukharina has seen it prudent to implement some social reforms. These social reforms, at their core, are a package of laws meant to ensure that all people within the [KOM.GetName] are seen and treated as equals. Not only will we ensure protections for racial minorities, but also for women as well. After all, as a modern socialist country, we cannot allow over half of our population to be deprived of the rights they deserve. There will undoubtedly be controversy, as people will try to push off these reforms until Russia is 'more stable', but to wait would be nothing but a betrayal to the socialist ideal."
 bukharina.47.a: "Equality for all!"
 bukharina.48.t: "A Whole Village"
 bukharina.48.d: "Dimitri entered Bukharina's office, curious. While he had meetings with Bukharina as he was the head of her guard, they weren't normally this late at night. He took a seat.\n\n\"Dimitri, can I try to explain a concept to you?\" He nodded. \"Imagine if you will, if children were raised communally. While their parents would play a role in their upbringing, said upbringing would be collective, involving the entire community. This would prevent the parents from passing on bad traditions to their children, while also ensuring that the children get a well-rounded childhood. This would also mean that the family, as it exists now, would be phased out if this was the nationwide standard. Does that make sense to you?\"\n\nDimitri mused it over. He understood the concept, and could see how it would be executed. \"Yes, it makes sense to me. However, I can imagine that there would be those opposed to such an idea, along with the possible negative consequences. Of course, you probably invited me here to bounce ideas for handling that off of?\"\n\nBukharina chuckled. \"You know me too well, Dimitri. Let's get to work then, shall we?\""

 bukharina.49.t: "Bravery and Comfort"
 bukharina.49.d: "Sofia took a deep breath, trying to push away her fear. \"Alexander, I want to become a teacher,\" she said, getting straight to the point. She felt her heart pounding. Oh god, what if he said no? What if he hat-\n\n\"Ok.\" Sofia looked at Alexander, shocked. Would it really be that easy? \"I know my family has had a very... dim view on women, especially wives, working, and that I trust them on a lot of things, but I can tell how much you want to be a teacher. Your passion for it is... very evident.\" He smiled.\n\n\"I love you, Sofia. You've supported me through so much. I'll always do the same for you.\" Alexander hugged her. Sofia felt her eyes tear up as she hugged him back. No matter what, she'd have her partner there to support her as an equal."
 bukharina.49.a: "And so a familial cycle of tradition is brought to its end."
 bukharina.50.t: "Inspiration"
 bukharina.50.d: "Ivan listened to the radio, surprised. He had heard from one of his friends that the government would be making an announcement tonight. While being a part of the local Soviet took up his time, it was his duty to ensure he was always up to date on governmental affairs. What he had heard shocked him.\n\nDevolution of power to the regional Soviets? Did this truly mean that the Soviets would have more control of local affairs finally? It was surreal to Ivan, who had seen the central government as the sole controller of power. He felt inspired. Maybe now was his chance to carve out a name for himself? He'd be sure to remain loyal to socialism, of course. Ivan had no plans to get into trouble now of all times, especially when change seemed on the horizons. He grabbed a piece of paper and a pen. Best to start writing down his ideas now, if this was truly the new reality of Russia."
 bukharina.50.a: "Handing over control inspires, after all."
 bukharina.51.t: "The Future Beckons"
 bukharina.51.d: "Bukharina sat on the park bench, enjoying the cool breeze. She had done a lot of work over the past few months, and it had been a long time since she was able to take a proper break. Not since her walk in Omsk had she been able to relax properly. Her mind wandered, for once freed of political concerns. However, her thoughts, after a time, would inevitably drift back to politics.\n\nBukharina was content. Her reforms had borne fruit, and it seemed the [KOM.GetName] was stronger than ever. Man and woman stood as equals, and those of a different race were not oppressed anymore. Unlike so many other socialists, she had worked to ensure that these rights weren't in name only. Bukharina could only hope it was a good start for fighting for equality.\n\nNow, with West Siberia stabilized and the foundations of a new Soviet Union forged, the time was approaching to unite all of Russia under one banner. Finally, the chaos that had plagued Russia for decades would be ended. However, that could wait for one more day. It was a beautiful day outside, and Bukharina would be remiss to let it go to waste."

 zhdanov.1.a: "未来は来る。望ましくとも、そうでなくとも。"
 zhdanov.2.t: "An Unsettled Peace"
 zhdanov.2.d: "The first real indications that Zhdanov has no intention of structuring his socialism along democratic lines are the widespread repeal of the Revolutionary Decrees, announced in public along a dozen channels. Radios are switched on, through the Republic's environs, and their volume turned all the way up as horrified ears take it all in.\n\nIt would probably have been easier to accept if the new regime offered concessions or promised a transition to a more permanent and just public order. Zhdanov, of course, promises with his trademark cheer that soon the citizens will return to a normality that favours the Republic as a whole.\n\nThe initial protests are unsettlingly loud and unnervingly close. Stations are barricaded or simply refuse to open, as do shophouses and public institutions. Police officers stationed in the district find themselves overwhelmed by the popular pressure, and a number of undercover police are nearly discovered and lynched by sheer force of popular anger. As it turns out, the broken clock of public anger does, in fact, strike twice a day.\n\nThis unnerves the covert agents of Special Circumstances. New plans are created in the dead of night, and networks once thought solid melt and coalesce in new configurations, like a shifting cloud forming around a dense maze. At the heart of this cloud are a group of seemingly random individuals. They will be the first test of the new Republic's socialist science.\n\nOn a Monday morning, as the not-protests roll into their fifth day, individuals begin to disappear from the protests, and when they return they speak as if they had never doubted the Republic - when they speak at all. The confusion they spread instead poisons the protests, rumors of internal disorder and violence stain its reputation, and by Wednesday order has returned, albeit in a less-than-satisfactory form."
 zhdanov.2.a: "Order is of paramount importance."
 zhdanov.3.t: "A Fait Accompli"
 zhdanov.3.d: "Andrei Zhdanov was a smart man, and the first thing you learned about being smart in the old Komi Republic was that you could never afford to show yourself as such. The Left was a den of people who believed they were smarter than they were, or worse, acted like it - that was why Zhdanov had seized control and his competitors had not. The key was not to act smart - it was to have the people at your back. Better yet - to have the right people have your back.\n\nAnd so when Zhdanov called the impromptu Party meeting he focused not on speechwriting, but on table arrangements. Like a dollmaker playing very elaborate house games, he moved certain positions close to him, and the names of those who were less than enthusiastic about Ultravisionary Socialism a little away, and in his mind he constructed a careful model of applause, built and timed just right to give the illusion of omnipresence.\n\nBy the time the Party Congress was formally in session, it had already been rigged to hell - but no one noticed, of course.\n\nWhen the Party Secretary declared the merger of the offices of General Secretary and Premier, it seemed like a tidal wave of applause swept the room, and confused delegates rose to give applause to what seemed like the People's Will. Delegates carefully planted in key positions on the perimeter clapped louder than the rest - the loudspeakers packed under each table amplified that effect. As Zhdanov accepted the laurels of Paramount Leader with grace, not a single question was raised.\n\nAnd so, without ever lifting a finger in immodesty, Zhdanov stole the Congress, the Party, and the Federation - and from that moment, the march of Soviet History was attuned to an altogether different beat."

 zhdanov.5.d: "Zhdanov, deep in the thrall of the latest in American rock coming from his gramophone, was suddenly jolted to the material world by the entry of the towering economy minister, Dmitri Shepilov. In an amazingly measured tone, Shepilov thumbed through the weighty file now on Zhdanov's desk, jumping from talks of telephonic networks to obscure policies in 20s Siberia to variables in economic simulation. Once the breathless birth of the future coming from Shepilov's mouth ended, Zhdanov bolted upwards and gave him a kiss on each cheek.\n\n\"Beautiful, beautiful. A fully automated and scientifically planned economy, free of any nefarious influences or chaotic inputs from men. Sheer Russian industriousness mixed with Marxism, with, with...with robotics! Yes, robotics! Ahh, Shepilov.

Standing on bales of hay before the faded blue farm house at the edge of the plot, he reached a crescendo in his already raucous speech. \"With these latest tools in the sowing of the Earth, our output can be greater than ever! If we are to build Ultravisionary Socialism, if we are to be permanently rid of capitalism and the Nazi yoke that protects it, we must understand our role in the five-year plan!

However today was an unusual day. Instead of the regular procedure of a meeting and then the sharing of ideas, they focused on the ideas of militarization. He himself saw many of these ideas as science fiction, ideas that only stood in books. However, as he learned more and more from the men who had spoken at the meeting, he saw that it was much more closer to reality than fiction. Ideas had been brought up to the men, such as the ideas of high altitude bombers that could strike enemies from altitudes only dreamt of. These ideas had floated around the men, as they worked harder and harder to one up another. More ideas had been considered such as powerful tanks that could withstand nearly all of the firepower in the German arsenal. While many of these ideas could be seen as nearly fiction to the many people of West Russia, it was nothing more than a possibility for the dreamers of the People's Commissariat of Science."

 zhdanov.13.t: "Next Generation Warfare"
 zhdanov.13.d: "The meeting had been early in the morning, with many of the men drinking coffee. Some of them preferred to be drinking a more heavy substance, one that would wake them up and prepare them for a day of discussing the next generations of warfare that they would develop and the armies would take place in. Many subjects had been brought up so far, such as the development of bombers that could strike from miles in the air and hit targets countries away.\n\nHowever, one of the more polarizing topics that had been brought up was the development of lasers. Lasers had been a personal interest of many of the scientists who had been assigned to work on the projects. However, they soon remembered that they had to focus on only the next generation and not fifty years now. Many of them shared the same ideas. The warfare in the coming decade would mostly be shaped as similar to the combat that many of them had seen so far. One that was fought and won with fast moving vehicles and a very mobile infantry. Some scientists had more outlying ideas that soon garnered more interest. One idea was proposed that the next generation of war would be completely fought with air combat. Land would be seen as irrelevant unless the helicopters or planes had been dropping off soldiers for a fast-strike mission, such as a raid. While the idea had certainly been seen as laughable at first, it soon garnered more attention as some of the men had begun to agree with it after thinking over the idea a few times. While certainly controversial, it was an opinion that could possibly work in due time. As the men filed out the building to continue their research, they wondered if it was truly possible at the end of the day."
 zhdanov.13.a: "Armored warfare shall reign supreme."
 zhdanov.14.t: "Warfare of the Next Century"
 zhdanov.14.d: "Like the meeting the scientists had recently, it was another one focused on warfare of a certain generation. However, instead of focusing on the next decade that many of them would possibly be alive for, they now focused on 2070. The year was picked due to it being a whole century later, one that would be very focused on really seeing on how much the scientists could think of. As the scientists fired into the room, they saw the assignment that they needed to do, so they began to get to work.\n\nUnlike the previous discussion, many of the men did not go into camps to discuss their ideas. The whole exercise was one that was seen as a radical decision. It was one hundred years later, certainly something that none of the men would be alive for. Maybe some of their great grandchildren, but not them. Many of them had differing ideas, but many stuck to one or two ideas by the end of the day. The first idea being that the warfare in 2070 would be largely focused around the internal mind of soldiers, with them fighting in an environment that would be largely based upon the basis of \"neuro-warfare\" a concept that would be developed in the next century as a way to both train soldiers and as a tool for battle. The second idea was one that the wars of tomorrow would be fought with huge towering machines. Ones that would carry armaments that would destroy the armies of today within hours. While they would be extremely expensive, even a country having one would be a massive detriment from any attacks on them. Like the last meeting, when the time was up, the men filed out. However unlike the last one, many had felt much more inspired by this one, thinking that if it was truly possible to have our minds do the battle for us or even giant machines to fight."

Some had taken unbelievably daring journeys over German lines to get there. Emma's story was significantly less impressive; she flew in from New York after some time as a student radical. She shared an apartment in the capital with a few other foreigners, and when the \"Embassy of the Global Proletariat\" was announced she was among the first to sign up.\n\nThe building was an old meeting hall, chosen for its scale, with different nations' delegations arranged in a great circle, and Emma decided to tour them before joining her comrades in the American section. First came the Soviet section, robustly populated with a number of local officials. Then came the British section, an eclectic collection of elderly resistance fighters and trade unionists. The German delegation piqued her interest. \"Comrades, you must have suffered greatly under fascism. How did you escape?\"\n\nThe man she was addressing looked confused before replying in what was unmistakably a local accent, \"Ah, I see the confusion. In the absence of German representatives, we are portraying the German proletariat in their stead.\"\n\nStrolling the aisles from Hungary's, to Iran's, to, most bizarrely of all, the \"oppressed African peoples'\" delegations, Emma found that the case was the same. Without the global proletariat actually present, the Soviets had taken to casting Russians in their roles and instructing them to imagine what the people of those nations might support.

It is no secret that your Government has long abandoned all reason and moderation - and that no amount of human blood and tears are sufficient to deny them what they deem to be theirs. For this reason, this letter is being written in [KOM.Capital.GetName] instead of Moscow, so long the heart of Russia - for this reason, millions suffer in the groans of an oppression so horrific it is almost unbelievable.\n\nFor this reason, while millions burned in East Europe, you defiled the surface of the Moon - an innocent celestial body which had done you no harm - with a flag steeped in the remains of those who have wanted nothing more than to resist you.\n\nWe understand, too, that your Masters wish to bend history, and have deluded themselves into believing they can control the future of the world by simply willing it into being with rifles and tanks. To this we have nothing to say, except the obligatory words of the sane to the madman: good luck! May you soon be disabused of this idea, and may its loss hurt you bitterly.\n\nBut we will make no bones about our own desires: what was stolen from the Workers of Russia, the Russian People cry out day and night to regain. The boots you use to stamp upon our people from old Kiev to old Leningrad will be consumed in fire as you are held aloft, the yoke turned inside out and twisted into a stabbing dagger. We will stop at nothing until our people are free.\n\nAnd on behalf of that part of the world that still calls itself free, we cordially invite you to take down the offending flags - and the armies that held them aloft - and leave at once, for Germania your home. Take them down from Moscow, Petrograd, Paris, the Moon - they are only tainted by the shadow of your bloody banner - and take the endless cycle of horror you bring with you."

 zhdanov.33.d: "Speech, International Workers' Solidarity Front. Guest Of Honor: Andrei Zhdanov.\n\nComrades, it is an honor to receive all of you. I am grateful for the kind words the assembled delegates have issued me, regarding the beauty of the city around us - and indeed I am proud of what the Soviet workers have accomplished here. Not for the stunning architecture or natural beauty, mind you, although we do possess plenty of those once you get past the suburbs. (Laughter.)\n\nNo, comrades, what I am speaking about is the beauty of Proletarian Unity. Now, I am sure many of us would laugh at that last statement, and who can blame you? The history of socialism, in Russia as everywhere else, is steeped in the tears of betrayal and mutual recrimination. Were one to ask a worker in the streets of your average urban city anywhere around the world, he would call the Communist one who was more dedicated to fighting his contemporaries than his enemies! (Laughter, commotion.)\n\nThat disunity cost us dearly when our enemies came for us, as we had foretold so clearly. Indeed, we are the Cassandras of history: always warning of the catastrophes awaiting the Capitalist world and on guard against fascism, and yet never able to protect ourselves from our predictions. Our squabbling kept us from mounting an effective resistance, here in Russia, and around the world the smoke of failed revolutions wafted countries even further into chaos than they had been at the start.\n\nNo more, comrades! We face the most fearsome and final enemy, right at the doors of Russia and around the world, and yet we have nowhere left to retreat! It is internationalism or collapse, united socialism or barbarism - life or death! Comrades, when we next sing the Internationale, let us bear in mind that there is something more than friendship and labor that unites us."

 zhdanov.35.t: "The March of Revolutionary Progress"
 zhdanov.35.d: "Andrei Zhdanov sometimes found the smiling, genial socialist he'd once been almost alien, a thorough stranger compared to the man he was now. As the Federation had grown in complexity and size, so too had his administrative functions, until it seemed like half his job was scheduling meetings for the right people to meet each other and get things done for him.\n\nThe other half, however...Zhdanov smiled. The other half of his job made it all worth it.\n\nThe old dream he'd hidden was coming into view, in gluts of weekly reports from the scientists. The limits of the human mind were being stretched into new shapes and patterns; even where his ideas had failed, they had given so much information in the bargain that he couldn't say they'd been failures at all. Soon the New Socialist Man would rise like Titans from the deep, super-men ready to rebuild the shattered nation and bring Proletarian humanity to where they'd always dreamt of going: the stars.\n\nAnd the machines on which they would ride were coming into being, too - as the Testing Initiatives grew ever more expansive, their tests blossomed into fruition, too. Forget about the military applications, he'd always told the generals. The wonder is enough. And the wonder Zhdanov experienced as he read about the test flights he couldn't watch personally was like - a man watching the summer stars, dreaming of taking flight. Yes, like a scene in a dream.\n\nNodding quietly, Zhdanov rummaged around his study and began a new series of scribblings in a well-worn leather notebook. Frowning, he scrapped the first draft he'd drawn and began a new one. This one was far more complex than the first; notes to self-referential articles abounded, and with them actual scientific reports, but in the centre were three clear and outlined words, circled repeatedly as with a child's drawing."

We swore to ourselves to expel the Germans from Moscow, to push them all the way back to Berlin, and in this, too, we failed.\"\n\n\"But we now have something that no one else in the shattered Union has - the Ultravisionary Immortal Science. The Bukharinists and the red juntas fumbled half-blind in the search for progress, and the fascists and monarchists and bourgeois pseudo-democracies stumbled fully-blind into their error. We know that our course is true; our people are our benchmark and the Science of Marxism our guide. \"\n\n\"But a man looking towards the Stars will never be content with the things of Earth alone. We speak often of re-engineering the Economy, of building a fairer and better way of life for all through the scientific control of goods production. We also speak of rebuilding Society, of tearing down the walls between man and woman, between worker and politician, that separate us from each other. But to do this alone is not sufficient.\"\n\n\"I now believe, comrades, that we must re-engineer the human heart itself - that just as the patient farmer, year after year, nudges his crops to greater fecundity, we, too, can create a bumper harvest in the Soviet youth and the generations after them. We know that the Marxist Dialectic dictates the struggle in the mind; we know how to condition these struggles to tilt one way or the other, so that the future of the Soviet mass-consciousness leans evermore towards greater unity.\"\n\n\"This is our future, comrades; not a world consumed by the struggle against fascist reactionism or fear of its inevitability - a world where the very thought of it is impossible.\""

 zhdanov.37.t: "We Are Not Alone"
 zhdanov.37.d: "Excerpts from the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Second Edition (1967)\n\nTHE ZHDANOV SOLUTION. The realisation that Ultravisionary Socialism is destined to spread throughout the universe, as determined by Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov's intense study of the immortal science of Ultravisionary Socialism. Originally promulgated as a solution to the Fermi Paradox of Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, which observes the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence of extraterrestrial life and the immense likelihood of its existence, Paramount Leader Zhdanov discovered that the most likely block to the advancement of extraterrestrial life to the interplanetary and intersolar stages of development was the persistence of backward stages of development (feudalism, capitalism, fascism) on alien worlds.\n\nWith the immortal science of Ultravisonary Socialism only existing on Earth, brought to us by the unique genius of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Zhdanov, only Earth holds the possibility of rising to a higher stage of interplanetary, intersolar, and perhaps even intergalactic development. It is thus the duty of the Soviet Federation, as one true embodiment of Ultravisionary Socialism, to spread itself first across the Earth, and then to alien worlds suffering under the oppression of primitive barbarism.\n\nTHE INTERSOLAR SOVIET FEDERATION. A future space-faring intersolar civilization founded on the principles of Ultravisionary Socialism, as vaticinated by Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov. Starting on Earth, the Intersolar Soviet Federation will spread from planet to planet, liberating alien species from the oppression of feudalism, capitalism, and fascism. Its armed forces, the Intersolar Red Armada, will obliterate all enemies in its path, assisting extraterrestrial workers and peasants in their struggle against their oppressors. It will educate the alien workers in the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Zhdanov, and ingrain in them a deep understanding of the immortal science of Ultravisionary Socialism. Ultimately, the Intersolar Soviet Federation is destined to expand throughout the universe, ushering in a final, Universal Soviet Federation, and an eternal aeon of universal peace, prosperity, and liberty."

 zhdanov.38.d: "We are faced with a momentous and serious choice. We could take it slow. This would mean a measured attempted transition to our ideals. In the meantime, we would be focusing most of our efforts on reclaiming Soviet lands.\n\nOr, alternatively, we could look to the future. We would be neglecting both our people's quality of life and a little bit of our economy. But that sacrifice would be in pursuit of the eventual completion of our true goal - the socialist superculture.\n\nSo should we stay the course, or try to move two steps at once?"

 zhdanov.39.t: "Observing Culture Shifts"
 zhdanov.39.d: "Junior Sergeant Volkov enjoyed his job. The People's Commissariat of Science paid well, the hours were good, and his tasks were usually fairly routine and easy. He also enjoyed the human element. Volkov was a reserved, private person, with no family and very few friends. Listening in on people for the Commissariat gave him a sense of connection to people he felt he would otherwise never have, even if they were total strangers.\n\nSome he even grew attached to. One old man, a retired violinist, routinely played his instrument in his small apartment on the third floor of the complex. He was of little interest in terms of scientific observation, yet Volkov still listened in almost every day, and came to love and depend on the old man's little personal recitals. When the old man finally died, Volkov felt the loss deeply. He even broke protocol and attended the old man's funeral from a distance, leaving flowers at his grave after his family and friends had departed.\n\nAnother subject Volkov grew close to was a florist who lived in one of the second floor apartments. He grew to love the sound of her voice, on the phone to her mother, or drinking with a friend, or just talking to her flowers, which she treated with great care and fondness. Volkov wrote down her every idle move, the notes then fed back to the scientists for analysis. Yet one day, while hosting a party at her house, Volkov caught her disparaging Paramount Leader Zhdanov, calling him a \"unhinged lunatic.\" Volkov felt great mental anguish over this incident.\n\nOf course, he ultimately turned her in. While their directive was merely to observe and document cultural and social shifts in the population, they were also duty-bound to report regressive behaviour and speech. She would do a short stint at a reeducation camp, and be back in no time. Yet when she returned, she was much changed. She no longer talked to her plants, or to anybody for that matter, not her mother or her friends. Volkov grew worried, and then bored. After a few days of silence, he moved on to find a new subject."

If the Master didn't tell him what was up, he'd find out himself!\n\nIt had been ten minutes since the last adult entered. By Pyotr's reckoning this was the time when the adults gathered. He began to move, barely ever touching the ground with his feet. Bound by silent bound he covered the space to the main lobby, where he'd heard the adults gather. His eyes grew wide as he approached the window. The harsh industrial lights were on, and he heard urgent talking from beyond the glass pane. A meeting, perhaps?\n\nLeaning in, he heard the muffled words: \"...will compensate you for the human losses, Kryushkov.\"\n\n\"You must be mad. Two weeks from the last 'retrieval' and you must take another child? What on earth are you doing to them?\" The Master's voice had something... different to it. It sounded reedy, almost pained.

Following this procedure, the operators of the initiative uplinked connection systems into and around the lymph nodes of the subject's necks, and into the brain stems of the subjects. These connection systems served to apply electrodes to the subjects, and graph the brain-wave activity of the subjects for use in data collection. The subjects themselves, procured from the GULAG system, all demonstrated obedient, somewhat sycophantish behavior when faced with the operators of the initiative. The connection systems uplinked the subjects to a (DATA EXPUNGED), to serve as a prototype for the collective consciousness system.

To add, some differences in subject behavior were noticed afterwards, although nothing that would suggest undergoing a procedure as dramatic as collective consciousness.

 ultravisionary.6.d: "Zhdanov trembled with excitement as he presided over the beginning of an era. The first collective consciousness experiment was about to begin, and with it, the destiny of the world would be irrevocably transformed. Zhdanov's technological strives into the future would be the landmark scientific achievements of the century, if not the history of humanity. With the creation of a collective consciousness, man and women would no longer be confined to their singular, mortal coil. The knowledge of one could be the knowledge of many. The reality of Ultravisionary Socialism as the preeminent ideology of the globe could be spread through uplink, rather than be debated and fought over.\n\nTaken aback by the possibilities, Zhdanov drifted into a dream unto himself. A dream of great, monolithic structures, floating and roaring throughout the astral plane. Clouds of electric mist, of deep purples and violets, surrounding the innovations of man. Brotherhoods of humanity, wielding their collective knowledge to construct a future unimaginable to the average man of today. A future beyond the boundaries of Earth, wherein Ultravisionary Socialism can reach the Solar System, and the nebulas beyond. A future where the witnessing of a quasar or black hole are as normal as receiving the daily mail. This is our next step to the beyond.\n\n\"Activate the machinery, the 'Collective Consciousness Initiative' begins now\" Zhdanov spat out, anxious to see man rise to the next level of scientific progress.\n\nThe volunteers shook in fear, their hands and legs strapped to metal chairs, wiring drived into the back of their skulls. Lights flickered on and off, all while Zhdanov leaned over a railing, eager to view the results of the initiative. The machines whirred and the wires wriggled from the raw power flowing through them. \"One... two... three... initiate!\"\n\nThe lights flashed, and the volunteers slouched over, their heads hanging between their knees."

The lights radiated from above, and shifted periodically from the dark blues and purples of a starry midnight sky, to the warm pinks and beiges of dusk. They were dressed in rags, as was the usual for these types of experiments. They were a wife and husband, who had each volunteered for the experiments, claiming to be \"psychics\" for the reward of food and vouchers, as was advertised. It only took a couple months for them to become the lab's favorite guinea pigs. None of the psychics had been in any intimate relationships with the other psychics, but these two, they were special in that regard. Perhaps telepathic links could be strengthened through love and knowledge of each other? Whether or not the case, their stay in the testing labs had exceeded months over the promised timeframe.\n\nStaring at each other, each with gaunt, skeletal complexions and shaved heads, they sulked in the misery of their situation. Bullet-proof glass separated them. Yesterday, it was rusty metal, and before that it was a curtain of broken wires. Everyday it was a new material separating them, a new sound in the background, and a new color of light hanging above their heads. Finally, able to see each other, their eyes met. It had been months since they last saw, and with whatever moisture left in their bodies, they cried at the sight of one another. The wife pointed her eyes towards a ventilation shaft on the wall, the researcher's method of viewing their behavior. She began nodding her head, as if she was talking, but she didn't move her mouth. The husband followed step. Their \"conversation\" went on for hours, before the scientists intervened.\n\n\"We would like to know, what would you say caused this surge of telepathy? The lights or background noise? Or, perhaps, it just took a few months before a proper link was established?\"\n\n\"Love, and confidence in our abilities.\" With those words, they were free."

In fulfillment of this initiative, several experiments have been conducted into the field of parapsychology through a variety of psychics, all of whom claim distinct methods and beliefs for themselves. A special attention has been given to the study of biocommunication, or human-to-plant communication, as it offers to our nation the most benefit in the study of agriculture and genetic engineering. Telepathic communication too, has been selected for prioritization, as it offers to our nation innumerable benefits concerning warfare and advanced tactics. After inspection of the overall capabilities of psychics and other practitioners of supernatural phenomena across the board, we have, regrettably, found that...\" The voice of the sycophant trailed off as he read what followed.

Experts in biocommunication were not able to present any evidence that they could communicate with plants, nor did they tell us how to. The plants, for their part, remained either unchanged or worse-off after we followed the procedures given to us by said biocommunication experts. Psychics, after being separated from one another by physical barriers, were not able to communicate telepathically. At times, they would even fake telepathic speech, although due to the misalignment of the separated psychics, it was a simple task to see who was faking what... Let us stop there.

The subjects were locked upon grates, tethered above the floor, for optimal recreation of German military emplacements and maneuvers. The subjects were given doses of psychoactive and hallucinatory drugs, in order to bring about an anomalous psychological state. Brain-wave scanners were positioned around their skulls, and their heart rates were monitored. Conventional reconnaissance methods, such as aircraft and knowledge collected from refugees and defectors, were used to pin-point the accuracy of the test subjects predictions. The first subject, (REDACTED), experienced neurological breakdown following eighty (40) seconds of the procedure. Following near-total mental collapse, (REDACTED) was transferred to facility XXX indefinitely. After recalibrating the operation, the second subject, (REDACTED), remained somewhat stable through two procedures (note, the second procedure was not voluntary). The second subject was transferred to facility XYX following mental breakdown. The operation was, again, recalibrated for the third subject. Recordings of wartime operations, and of staged conversations about war plans and troop logistics, were played at random intervals around the third test subject, to gauge their ability to wield extrasensory perception in order to locate the source of the recordings. The third test subject did, at points, respond correctly. It is unknown whether or not this is due to the test subject predicting the sources of the noise, or randomly moving their head. The third test subject successfully underwent two operations, and reported back details of military emplacements and troop deployments, albeit vague and shallow details. The third test subject is being transported towards a military facility, in order to test remote physical tasks on army proving grounds. For now, the RAINBOW BODY procedure is recommended for use on (DATA EXPUNGED) and enemies of the state."

There was no conception of comfort to be found in this place. She craned her neck, only for red rays to pierce her eyes. Out of the nothing, shaking erupted. A tremor of Reality's hands. Deathly noises exploded from across the soundscape. Bullets ripping through flesh, mines tearing through victims, the quaking of her bunker. A haze following the pressure, the lights forming absorption lines. Her eyes widened to the pain, the sounds and colors forming a barrier of absolution. A new noise, a voice, with the complexion of a grainy, half-cut transmission, boomed from below.\n\n\"LOC-T- MIL-TARY EMPLACEMENTS.\" She trembled, looking at the corners of her vision. The darkness appeared to fizzle, to bloat and pop, to warp around the edges of her vision. Suddenly, a thunderclap. The grate to which she was tied shook with a fury unknown to mind. By the end, the colors had transformed. They slid to and fro, passing freely throughout the starry manifestations of shadow which surrounded her.\n\n\"L-CA-T- TR-P D-PL-YME-NT-.\" She forced her eyes to remain locked onto a pocket of Reality's consciousness. Out of the motion, a magnetic energy tied its tendrils to her grate, and darkness unleashed forth a solar flare of umbra. A conversation pierced the ethereal plane. Battle plans, divisions, logistics, and other such words broke through, but what were words to mean anymore?\n\n\"-C-T- - -X- -O-E.\" The colors pushed together and melted into a single stream of raw, erosive energy. The darkness blotted, and no matter where she looked, the spots never left her sight nor moved their position. The color formed a cyclonic tide around the blots, until an image was birthed from void. Reality's pupil. It moved ever forward, the color rotating around its form ever faster, until swallowing her. She would be the next follower of vision, and that was all it would ask of her."

I will summarize the full report, which you will find enclosed with this message. The language itself is enhanced and modified to include 15% more information per syllable, and our best efforts have been made to eliminate redundant words and grammar. It is also mutually intelligible with the organically formed Russian language. Further refinement is in progress.\n\nOur evaluation of fifty-one (51) subjects, aged 18-60 months at the start of the experiment, over a period of several months indicates a major increase in altruistic behavior, absent any other stimuli or education beyond what a subject in the control group received. Prompted descriptions by test subjects of the concepts of capitalism, socialism, community, and other such terms also demonstrates a statistically significant level of approval of concepts we have sought to linguistically code as desirable, and a similar negative correlation with concepts coded as undesirable.\n\nWorking with psychologists and education specialists, we have created a series of instructive documents outlining the purpose and basic principles of our \"New Russian,\" as well as the major differences between the language. Materials to instruct both schoolchildren and adults are also in production, anticipated to be ready for a limited trial distribution in approximately six months."

Those raised in the areas near Perm tended to be more reclusive and reluctant to share, while those from Syktyvkar were more likely to do the opposite. It may have to do with the environment they were raised in, or something else unrelated to the language that we haven't accounted for. And some of the experimental group did not seem to be affected.\"\n\nThe professor nodded. \"The data still looks good.

We attribute this to them being raised under the proper guidance of state-run orphanages and cannot conclusively determine if the language had an effect upon their behavior or not.\n\nWe believe that this unfortunate outcome resulted from errors in the construction of the language and the instruction of it to the young students. We are continuing to work on further development and testing of our modified Russian to ensure that futures testing proves to be more conclusive. Factors we plan to eliminate include birthplace, parentage, and parenting methodology. To fulfill these tests, we will need a greater and more uniform sample size.

The set itself is minimalistic: there is no furniture higher than 4 feet, the library has no bookshelves, the gymnasium only includes a running track and lifting stations.\nThe subjects were instructed to inhabit the compound for a four (4) month period, during which they were observed by our staff via hidden cameras and wire tappings. There was no interference on our part throughout the entire experiment, the subjects had acquitted themselves well to the new environment.\nResult: Without privacy, the subjects resorted to: (in chronological order)\n-Excessive conversations with one another (concerning trivial details), daily workouts and readings of Marxist literature.\n-During month two (2), our staff noticed a trend among the subjects: thirty two (32) of them had formed strong relationships with one another, confiding personal details and secrets. The less sociable ones continued with the routine described above.\n-By the end of final month, all but two (2) of the subjects were highly sociable, partying in the main hall and engaging in various activities (see page 22).\nConclusion: We were able to gather critical data with this experiment. It appears that the human mind is indeed wired to the collective, reinforcing the findings of great socialist scientists. The mere fact that the subjects were willing to put aside privacy in favor of interaction, and eventually developed trust, is a great success. Unfortunately, our data is not yet complete - further studies will need to be done to support the findings here, and there is the matter of the two (2) individuals that had refrained from social interaction.

Since you have certainly passed the accuracy tests, I believe it is about time to transition to the simulation tests, don't you agree?\" said the engineer standing behind the soldier. He looked especially smug about receiving praise from Turgenev, who had harshly criticized many of his previous designs.\n\n\"Yeah, sure. Hopefully it doesn't snap when I get off the helicopter.

It has performed as expected in airborne drop scenarios, and has been proven to be functional as an infantry weapon. Comrade Afanasyev has managed to reduce the inaccuracy caused by the rifle's unique characteristics down to a margin of 5%. Soldiers testing the weapon report its unusually light weight as a major boon, and some officers have already requested the Tarakan prototype rifle, official name pending, for use in airborne operations.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nProject Tarakan has proven to be a success, and Comrade Afanasyev's design meets all requirements necessary for production authorization.

Your. Shitty. Rifle,' with that said, Turgenev walked away from the firing range, the engineer too afraid to continue the argument.\n\nPROJECT TARAKAN - TEST 41 RESULTS:\nComrade Asfanasyev's 'bullpup' design has faced numerous problems during its development. The chief issue being its long-range accuracy. The extremely short barrel and extremely light weight have a tendency to drastically reduce the accuracy of those using the rifle. Test 41 concluded when the soldier testing the rifle, Sargeant Sergei Turgenev, grew frustrated with the rifle's inaccuracy and exited the firing range. Sergeant Sergei Turgenev received a brief reprimand for his poor behavior, but is expected to return to normal duty within the week.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe Tarakan prototype rifle has failed to meet any accuracy standards required for production, and development of the rifle is growing too expensive to justify the rifle's somewhat niche purpose. As such, it is recommended that Comrade Asfanasyev's project be defunded, and for him to be returned to his position within the Soviet Instrument Design Bureau."

The remaining component was the torpedo bay, loaded with four (4) units.\n\nAnother test commenced, where the pilots were told to sink a fishing boat on the same coast. The experiment was a success, but three (3) torpedoes missed the mark. The pilots reported the aerocraft as difficult to handle, too fast to properly maneuver, and lacking in proper weaponry.\nConclusion: It is impossible to add on more weapons components with our current technology. The craft we have now, while workable, is not yet efficient in combat. More testing is to follow."

Various measurements of different airframes and payloads yielded no results. Modern weaponry was deemed too heavy for liftoff.\n\nFortunately, two weeks ago, Engineer XXXXX XX (whom I would like to recommend for promotion) offered a blueprint patched together from existing naval bomber and jet interceptor designs. Emphasis was placed on fuel efficiency and RADAR-immunity. We adopted his designs and constructed a prototype (see page 98).\n\nThe project was tested off of the coast of Arkhangelsk. Four (4) pilots maneuver the vehicle at speeds ranging from XX-XXX mph, but almost crashed upon breaking speed XX. A few fixes later, most weaponry was removed. Most mounted payloads, including heavy machine guns and experimental point-defense installations were deemed too heavy. The torpedo mechanism was successfully loaded, but cannot be fired properly while in-flight as a critical mechanism would make the aerocraft too heavy.\nConclusion: It is impossible to add on more weapons components with our current technology. The craft we have now, while workable, is not at all efficient in combat. I recommend we repurpose existing models for civilian purposes."

 ultravisionary.25.d: "Valentin marveled as the prototype activated. There was a hum of energy, and the fighter in front of him went completely silent. Similarly, the laser wiped out a radar system without harming the dog sitting next to it, and the Szhatie prototype effectively tracked and disable three aircraft, forcing their pilots to bail. It was surprisingly silent too, a small buzzing sound that was easily drowned out by the sound of the generator's roar. The prototype had surpassed all expectations he had had for it, and the scientist next to him kept rambling on and on about the many scientific miracles that went into building it. Clearly he was proud of his work.\n\n'So, Comrade Aslanov, how much would it cost to make more of these miraculous weapons? They've clearly proven their effectiveness,' The general expected some long-winded response from the overly talkative scientist, but instead he went deathly pale and went silent. That couldn't be a good sign.\n\nPROJECT SZHATIE RESULTS: Partial Success\n\nCONCLUSION: While the Project Szhatie prototype exceeded all expectations, and passed all tests with flying colors. The officer overseeing the tests initially advocated for further production, until learning of the costs. The artificial rubies used to focus the laser are prohibitively expensive, and drastically raise the cost of production. This alone makes Project Szhatie unfeasible for mass-production, however the design is also limited by its massive power requirements, which likewise raise the design's cost. General Varennikov suggests handing the prototype over to the propaganda department, on the basis of the prototype being 'absolutely marvelous'."

 ultravisionary.26.d: "PROJECT SZHATIE\n\nPROJECT REPORT: Despite spending large amounts of funding on creating artificial rubies in order to focus the hypothetical laser, no feasible design for a laser array has been drafted by the team. Comrade Aslanov claims that his team is close to discovering the optimal array design, however the most recent prototype broke one of the artificial rubies when activated.\n\nReplacing this artificial ruby has been deemed too costly, and would set the project back by months. The expected power requirements of the Szhatie prototype, if ever successfully built, are also estimated to be astronomically high, and overall, Project Szhatie seems less and less likely to ever see completion. As such, General Varennikov, the official supervising the project directly, has slated Project Szhatie for defunding, effective immediately."

While the droop nose malfunctioned on the second flight due to a faulty electrical system, the error was quickly remedied, and the aircraft has performed without serious fault in subsequent tests. The variable sweep wings have proven to be highly effective in their role, allowing the bomber to use a much shorter runway for takeoff and avoid the danger of stalls at high speeds. The bomber is planned to be capable of carrying both heavy cruise missiles for standard targets and lighter rocket pods for softer targets.\n\nPerformance-wise, the bomber has met all parameters expected, surpassing Mach 3 and having a service ceiling of 12,000 meters, high enough to evade German interceptors and anti-aircraft weapons. Avionics data suggests that the expected loadout will be well within its capabilities. The cost of developing such an aircraft has been extensive, as more than six hundred patents have been filed based on this project alone, but as production scales we will find more efficient methods of producing the necessary parts. Four more prototypes are being constructed for further refinement, and the Sukhoi Bureau is preparing to move to full scale production."

The aircraft itself is unstable and ultimately unable to reach the expected altitudes or speed. The droop nose also requires a periscope for the pilot, as it blocks the view of the pilot when extended for supersonic flight. Given the projected cost of the aircraft, I am recommending that funding to the project cease. It fails to live up to the expectations set by the funding proposal.\n\nHowever, there is some good news to report- the limits to which our team has pushed the boundaries of current technology allowed them to make several advances in the field of aerospace technology. The variable-sweep wings are an extremely useful innovation for our military, allowing our aircraft to take off with a more stable configuration, and switch midair to a supersonic configuration. This technology and others like it will be a great asset for our new air force."

This vehicle would outfly any German interceptor and higher than any anti-air guns could reach.\n\n\"I'm at cruising height.

At such great heights, the thoughts of the troubles below escaped him, and memories of the unification war slipped through his mind.\n\nA mechanical grinding from behind him broke his concentration. The controls began to rebel, and he felt them steadily and slowly tilt towards the Earth. \"Left wing didn't deploy. Trying to regain control.\"\n\nAnd then he was confined once again, feeling the mask choking his face, the flight suit constricting him, a glass coffin the only thing between him and the infinite abyss of the sky. Holding the controls, steady and unresponsive. Gravity fogged his vision, blackening around the edges while the sound of tearing metal drowned out his hearing.

Our attempt to work with the specifications given has been far from a resounding success, but has some promise. The vehicle suffers from many of the same issues as the German tanks captured during the last war, particularly the Tiger and Maus. CHEREPAKHA solves a number of problems those vehicles suffered from, particularly the unreliability of the drive train and excessive fuel consumption, and overall is able to maintain a higher level of performance for longer.\n\nHowever, a number of other problems have emerged as a result of our solutions to the original problems. The lead lining of the crew compartment, the four-track drive train, and the unusual disc shape have resulted in the need for us to establish a completely new production line at the Izhevsk plant to create the prototype. Maintenance has also been an issue, as access to the mechanical portions of the tank is limited due to the design of the tank, and makes field repairs effectively impossible.\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, the vehicle has performed quite well in trials run by our personnel and demonstrations run for our military procurement officials, proving highly resistant to artillery fire and to rarely break down. It is not suitable for mass deployment, as it lacks mobility to contend with modern battle tanks, but it possesses the armor and firepower that allows it to take on anything lighter, and will certainly fill an important niche in our military."

 ultravisionary.31.d: "From:Colonel Barinov\nTo:Major General XXXXXX\nDate:[GetDate]\n\nThe testing stage of Project Trezubets has concluded, and the results have far outstripped our expectations for the rifle. Senior Engineer Korobov and his team have overcome the anticipated problems related to the feed system, having implemented an innovative method of allowing each barrel to be fed by the same magazine, requiring the operator use a single ninety round magazine instead of one for each individual barrel. The rifle can also be fired ambidextrously since the cartridges are ejected behind the magazine. The rifle's rate of fire meets projected expectations, approximately 3 times faster than our currently equipped Kalashnikov rifles, and is chambered in the same 7.62x39 caliber.\n\nThe primary issues encountered in testing resulted from increased recoil, due to the greater amount of propellant used in each pull of the trigger. The rifle is also heavier than our current standard-issue rifles, and presents a considerable logistical challenge by expending three times as much ammunition as a standard Kalashnikov.\n\nHowever, if these logistical issues can be overcome, the rifle will serve as an excellent front-line infantry weapon. Both Korobov and myself consider this to be an unmitigated success, and the Trezubets team is ready to implement full-scale industrial production of the prototype, pending the Paramount Leader's approval."

The weapon has run into some difficulties that restrict it from being a ubiquitous infantry weapon. The feed system has encountered numerous problems with jamming, and our engineers were unable to solve the problem of ejecting the cartridges. After some failed experiments with caseless ammunition they have settled on the 7.62x39mm round used in Kalashnikov's automatic rifles, which should allow us to integrate it into our supply chain with relative ease.\n\nIncreased recoil has led us to recommend the addition of a bipod and an increase in the size of the weapon to allow the inclusion of a more robust feed system. Once this is completed, we will be able to put this weapon into production as a functional heavy support rifle. The increased rate of fire allows it to properly fulfill its role without consuming too much ammunition, and the jamming rate will be significantly reduced by the time we begin the manufacturing process.\n\nThe weight of the weapon makes it prohibitively heavy to issue as a standard infantry rifle, but it is lighter than most of our machine guns, and the use of a magazine instead of a belt makes it simple for any soldier trained in operating a Kalashnikov to use. Overall, the new weapon should make a fine addition to our armories."

At least the October Revolution was coming up soon in their studies, so he could read up on a bit of action.\n\nThere were two reasons driving Kliment to stay diligent in his studies and not slack off, the first being his friends. They were into communism far more than he was and they were much more invested into this assignment, but they made Kliment laugh, they goofed around with him, they played pranks on each other, but most of all, they made him feel whole. And when school ended and he said his brief goodbyes to them 'til the next day, he'd have only one thing on his mind.\n\nIndeed, the young teen cared little for the old Bolshevik, and yet he was the greatest reason he worked so hard in his studies. His family was one marred by strife; from a father struck down by the Germans in the western war, to cousins and old family friends torn away during their conquest, in the end he was left with only a drunken uncle, traumatized by loss. He'd return only to find a sobbing mess on the couch, who'd immediately embrace him once he stepped inside. His uncle had turned to the ideals of Lenin when all else was lost to him; all else but Kliment. When his uncle learned he was now studying the man himself, his joy at the news was the first time Kliment could remember him truly being happy. And he knew he couldn't disappoint his family; his only family."

 suslov.16.d: "\"And this, my dear students, is a lathe.\"\n\nRoman was in his first class in a recently opened professional technical school. He was born near Plesetsk, in a poor peasant family. When Roman was seven he went to the local school and showed his talent for technical sciences - mostly math and basics of physics. Out of almost a hundred applicants, Roman was one of the first - a technical school for him was a chance - to improve himself, to help his family and his country.\n\n\"Most of you don't know how it works or about its place in a factory. But that's the reason why you come here, right? So, let's start with the basics.\"\n\nRoman's hand got tired after writing all the functions of a lathe, main elements of it, and many more to his notebook. That machine looked like something out of this world, a centerpiece of a song of steel and fire. And their teacher said that a factory in Plesetsk has dozen of machines just like that! Roman was listening to every word of the lecture, trying to write down every small detail. He already planned a future for himself - a future of a proud worker, the backbone of a country, and a man who could feed his family."

 suslov.17.d: "The university building was new and gleaming, and its administrators could not have been prouder of their contribution to the resurrection of their country's academic life. The news that the renowned chemist Nikolay Semyonov was interested in speaking to students there met with a flurry of activity, furious arrangements of venue and seating. It had been hard, but now that the day had come it became clear that their efforts had paid off swimmingly. The lecture hall was practically overflowing with students, brought there both by interest and a hefty promotional campaign by the government, always interested in showcasing its scientific progress. The room was buzzing with excitement and potential as Semyonov took the stage.\n\n\"First of all, I'd like to thank you all for coming here. Even your presence shows how far we have come as a people. My generation had hardships of our own, but for you, who never knew a Russia that was not at war, to have achieved so much with all that was against you is truly remarkable. Your generation, the chemists and engineers, writers and artists, scientists and scholars in so many other fields, will be the ones who bring the Soviet people back onto the world stage with aplomb. My generation was unable to keep the Union together. Yours will make it the pride of the entire world, so long as you keep working and striving to be better than the day before.\"\n\nSemyonov went on for slightly under an hour, constantly having to ask the audience to restrain their applause. The air of hope and optimism in the room was palpable, and everyone, attendee and planner alike, could agree that it had been a roaring success."

 suslov.18.d: "With all of Russia united minus Siberia and Moscow, Suslov can stand as one of the greatest Russian communists in history. Suslov and Soviet Russia have overcome every challenge, defeating revisionists, capitalists, fascists, and much more. The Russian Army stands unchallenged in the West, modern and large. Production and industry led Russia through a modern kind of warfare, and collectivization freed the peasants and the poor of Russia.\n\nAnd yet, Suslov knew there was still a long way to go. The Siberian government stands in the way of revolution and true communism, oppressing the workers and farmers alike. Meanwhile, the Germans sit waiting in Europe, murdering and enslaving those who oppose them. The Japanese as well occupy much of the Far East, including Vladivostok, stealing from Russians and occupying Russian industry and resources.\n\nAll opposed Suslov's Russia, and all had to be defeated. Only then would the union be preserved and socialism succeed."

Secret Societies, spies, and partisans all continue to terrorize West Siberia and our garrisons there, making it very hard to govern. Sending more of our own security services will be necessary for stabilizing the region and destroying what remains of the previous government.\n\nOur own spies will also track down what remains of the West Siberian Intelligence Branch, eliminating any threat they pose. We will make sure all important people are supervised in our newly controlled territories, to make sure they do nothing unfavorable. More garrisons and infantry will be mobilized in West Siberia as well to track down any secret societies and neutralize their members.\n\nSnuffing the partisans out of their hideouts will also be the job of the army and our generals are sure they won't remain a threat for long. The East will be secured, and with it will finally come form of cohesion."

They would never be satisfied with the power given to them, so they must be destroyed alongside the Black League. It will be the only way for the Revolution to not be ended by revisionists nor radicals."

However, many of the men who were being considered to help run the West Siberian Oblasts clearly were not early risers- only fourteen of the eighteen candidates were there by the beginning of the morning. Thankfully, he was patient.\n\nThe questions were simple- almost deceptively so. \"What are your qualifications?\" Alexander asked one man with hair loss, who quickly pulled out forms. \"My loyalty to the revolution, as shown by my impressive service-\" He began, as Alexander took the papers quickly.\n\n\"Thank you; we will call you back as soon as possible. Next.\" He interrupted, as the man sheepishly filed out, replaced by a thin, tall, and smiling officer. He said little besides answering the questions- not talkative; potential asset, if loyalty is determined to be sufficient...\n\n\"This report says you have often been found in the company of drunkards and women; is it true?\" He asked another, as the third man paused. \"Well, if I am to represent the people, should I not know who I am representing?\" They replied, as Alexander narrowed his eyes slightly.\n\n\"We will get back to you, comrade.\""

In a public speech in Syktyvkar, the General Secretary of the new unified government of West Russia condemned our nation for being an \"exploitative imperialist power.\" He rambled on about how our foreign policy supposedly \"chains free nations to the hip of the Reich\" and how the Second World War was only started to \"sate the contradictory material interests of the bourgeoisie.\" At the end he called for solidarity with the oppressed peoples of Europe and stated his government would not rest until the Russian proletariat was freed from our control."

In it, he condemned our peacekeeping and developmental initiatives abroad, saying, \"Be it 'liberal democracy' or 'national socialism,' the underlying causes remain the same, and therefore so too do the outcomes; imperialism takes many forms, none as devastating as the German Reich, but none as insidious and dishonest as the United States of America.\""

What a shame, then, that their message is so despicable.\n\nThe General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics declared our empire to be illegitimate and \"a blatant and disgusting violation of the inherent rights and interests of the East Asian people.\" He went on to state that, \"The Japanese Empire pretends to march forward, hand-in-hand with the nations and people it so mercilessly oppresses. To this end they are a synthesis of the German and American models of imperialism: their government possesses the totalitarian state power that fascism requires to suppress their population, while pretending to act in their client states' best interests, not unlike the relationship between America and their puppets in the OFN.\""

However, it seems that a new power is emerging in the Russian homeland, one that may be interesting in working with us.\n\nMikhail Suslov, General Secretary of the newly-formed Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, praised the efforts of the United States thus far in battling the spreading tide of fascism in a private communication sent directly to the White House. He considers Russia fortunate to have an ally as economically and militarily capable of battling fascism as America.

Following our reclamation of western Russia we are once again the strongest socialist nation in the world, and it is our duty to serve as the vanguard of the global revolution. Across the world the proletariat yearns for their freedom while the fascists and the bourgeois capitalists profit from their labor. We will not allow their oppression to continue any longer. Whether they be legal political parties or underground partisan movements, the USSR shall support socialist and communist movements around the globe. From Havana to London to the heart of Africa, the brave revolutionaries of every nation and society will call the Soviet Union their greatest ally and friend, knowing they can count on us to stand with them in the name of international class solidarity.\n\nThe established powers of the world will not approve of our proclamation, but the establishment has never approved of the new revolutionary order. They will call us dishonorable and say we are supporting terrorists and radicals. We know the truth, that a freedom fighter is a terrorist to his oppressor and common sense seems radical to anyone who's prosperity relies on an antiquated social order. The fascists failed to crush the revolution in 1941. The struggle of the working class never ended, and now that the Soviet Union has returned, the great helmsman of the proletarian revolution shall guide the peoples of the world to their freedom. As Marx wrote over a hundred years ago, the revolution is inevitable, and its time is coming soon."

The delegates entered to the applause of crowds, the speeches were read off- exactly as written. All proceeded according to plan, without a single hint of revisionism, or deviation. In truth, it was slightly boring- the old days had plenty of plots. Plenty of excitement. Plenty of chaos.\n\nNo, he preferred this better. As the din briefly brought him out of reminiscence he went back to eying the delegates and taking notes, one spoke loudly- perfect spokesman. Two others stood at each other's side, a practically identical appearance- though one pandered to the crowd, and the other remained silent, watching everyone around him like a hawk- brother included.\n\nAll of these men had been selected for this very moment; and all of them played their part as though Mikhail was personally pulling their strings. He barely spoke aside from a small correction, or a single statement, simply observing as the Congress churned along, a well oiled machine that provided a shining example of how future congresses should be conducted; though there was much work to do."

 ultravisionary_flavor.1.d: "Nikolai Kardashev rubbed his eyes, the bright light of his desk lamp revealing the large stack of documents, equations and proposals from every bureaucratic part of Zhdanov's scientific apparatus. There were times when Kardashev wished he could take a break, to just curl up under a blanket and sleep for a healthy amount of time. But the workload was too big, especially considering he was working 60 hour weeks to begin with.\n\nNikolai blinked, and suddenly an image of Zhdanov's smiling face popped into his mind. He shuttered, shoving it out as fast as it appeared. He leaned back in his chair, remembering the past couple months of his life.\n\nIt all seemed good, at first. Zhdanov, the Paramount Leader, offered him work on the new space program. Nikolai, a space lover since his childhood in Moscow, took him on the offer. Such a simple time. Then, he heard the rumors. Then the rumors became experiences, and experiences became nightmares as he was assigned to different projects, all somehow related to 'socialist utopian'.\n\nAnd he had done nothing but nod along, sign papers, and do everything to lay low. Sometimes, in the dead of night, when the only light that Nikolai had the pleasure of seeing was the swaying bulb in his bedroom or in the cubicles of the departments in whatever new building he was shuffled into, Nikolai wondered whether he was just as monstrous as Zhdanov, the man who signed off on every damnable experiment he had the displeasure of witnessing. Other times, Nikolai wondered whether his actions would do anything in the first place. Would his mother and father, those old revolutionaries, have been proud of him?\n\nIt didn't matter.

Even now, with the overthrow of Suslov, behind the bars of a holding cell, Andropov was still feared.\n\nIt had been many, many months since he last saw the outside world: the sounds of a crowd, the movement of paper, even the swaying of trees were nothing but a memory. But he never broke. In spite of it all, he never broke. He waited, just for the time to strike.\n\nIt was a sunny day when Andropov decided that today was the day. He slipped a rusted nail down into his shoes, and, walking to lunch, thrusted it into a guard's neck. Blood gushed out, and, in the confusion, Yuri grabbed his gun, and began firing wildly as he ran down a long, winding hallway.\n\nFrom there, it was anarchy. Suddenly, as if on cue, rose up in rebellion. A bloodbath ensued, one that Andropov was proud to have helped orchestrate.\n\nHe laughed as he got to a fence in the courtyard, the watchtowers almost empty after the riot started. Gun fire blazed on in the background, and, not wanting to become another cold body, Andropov ran for it, climbing the fence with an energy he hadn't felt in a long time. On the other side, he didn't look back, and, as he ran, wondered where he would go."

Perhaps he needed a break.\n\n\"Papa! Papa!\" cried his daughter's voice as she came running to him. \"There's people in the village!\" Pichugin set his axe aside. \"Come now, Artyomova, what kind of people?\"\n\n\"Outsiders!\" she said. \"They want everyone in the village to come meet them!\"\n\nPichugin gritted his teeth. Outsiders always brought with them danger and bad luck, whether they be raiders from the Urals or those liberals in Tomsk. All he wanted for his community was to live simple, peaceful lives in service to God, not troubled by the chaos that was the rest of Russia. But if they wished to talk, so be it.\n\nThe entire village crowded around the company of Red Army soldiers. They watched these men with weary eyes, knowing well what their sort often wanted. Their leader, an officer of sorts, stepped forward and cleared his throat.\n\n\"My fellow comrades! Under the decree of our Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov, your village has been liberated from the grip of anarchy! You are now under the glorious protection of the Soviet Federation! Today is but one step forward to your true destiny, comrades, a destiny that we all share; one that lies beyond the stars. For as our superculture expands across this planet, it cannot remain here forever. The flame of Ultravisionary thought must spread across intersolar space, to unshackle the extraterrestrial from the chains of fascism, feudalism and capitalism and to usher in a superculture across the universe under the guiding wing of the Universal Soviet Federation! The glories above lie in waiting my comrades, and with your help, we will see them in our lifetimes!\"\n\nThe crowd didn't respond. An awkward quiet settled in the air.

But, if she were to be asked about any of the myriad and fantastical scientific initiatives undertaken by the Federation's government, she could have offered little insight.\n\nSuch a response would have puzzled many, and led to a subset of the same questioning how she could therefore even call herself an Ultravisionary. Her response? That while Zhdanov and the others looked to the stars, she looked to the minds, faces, and identities of the millions of the people in the Federation.\n\nShe was one of, and certainly the most prominent, social Ultravisionaries within the faction, focused on achieving radical and revolutionary leaps in progress of the population's social order. Methods of thought, tenets of instruction, particularities of language and, yes, even the very names people were given were all concepts that she intended to change. Change for the better.\n\nFurtseva knew that her social proposals and pursuits were deemed as less important than the scientific ones, but she also knew that while achievements in space would be limited to the few, achievements in the Federation's - and eventually the world's - social order would be transformational to the many, and she was prepared to work to achieve that dream.\n\nWhich made her position as the Federation's Foreign Minister so valuable. Zhdanov and the others might have thought relatively little about dealings with the outside world, but she saw it as an opportunity to prepare the ground - worldwide - for growth.\n\nGrowth that she would one day see achieved."

He thought she could help. And that request, proving that he had not even bothered to learn what her position on such pursuits were, was the greatest insult of all.\n\nFurtseva was used to it. As one of the vanishingly few women in the Presidium, let alone within the Ultravisionary faction, she was sought out by many for shows of support. As though her voice mattered more. Perhaps it did, in a sense, but only so far as it could be shown. Presented. Placed on a shelf to be pointed at as an 'example of the wide appeal of our policy,' whatever that policy may be. What she actually thought mattered little.\n\nWhich meant a lot of 'polite conversations' and 'nice dinners' with other politicians who chased after her, more interested in her biology than her position. But if she could not avoid such pursuits, she could at least exploit them. She could promise to help the man, knowing full well that Shepilov would defeat the initiative on his own, and in turn gain his vote for one of her upcoming social proposals. A nice victory, she thought.\n\nAnd, so, she maintained her polite smile. The screaming had ended."

Her attention was drawn back to events when Zhdanov began pontificating about how the support of the people, of the no-doubt visionaries among the Federation's millions of ordinary citizens, was critical to the Presidium's efforts in securing technological dominance.\n\nAt first she had ignored the line. And then it was if she had been struck by lightning. So powerful was the moment that her mask cracked, if only for a second, and even then drawing several interested stares.\n\nShe had been struggling so hard to gain support from the scientists for initiatives in support of the socialist superculture that she knew was critical to create. But all she had to do was explain to them that a true socialist culture, united in visionary thought, could not but expend every effort, dedicate every joule in their being, towards the achievement of scientific greatness.\n\nThe scientists were empirical men, procedural men, and they implicitly accepted as fact that proper support and infrastructure was critical to the success of any experiment or feat of engineering. If she could only convey that proper social culture was just as important as the right carbon content of steel or the correct amperage of an applied current, then she could all but guarantee support.\n\nFurtseva allowed herself a small smile.

Moving to back the ruble with energy, as opposed to gold, silver, or national confidence itself? It seemed a mad proposition.\n\nBut both of them knew very well that when Andrei Zhdanov proposed something considered visionary, it could not be ignored. And so, together with Zhdanov himself, they worked late into the night. As they did, however, they could not but grow entranced by the idea. By how many problems it solved. By the radical transformation it would no doubt catalyze at all levels of society.\n\nImagine! A currency eternally backed by a local commodity, a commodity universally applicable! Workpower liberated towards positive communal uses! Freedom from the corrupting forces of speculation and manipulation!\n\nEven apart from the ideals the men could conceptualize, the direct benefits could not be overstated either. If currency was connected to energy, then as national energy output increased so too did currency supply, but absent inflationary practices. And, if such a scheme was introduced, the work of the state's planning organs could be immensely simplified, as citizen rations could be determined through a simple allocation of energy, rather than as a basket of goods.\n\nThere would be problems, yes, but what true visionary could disagree with what was offered? Or shrink from the challenge to what countless will surely say cannot be done? Not they, and so once the proposal was complete, Zhdanov ordered that it be introduced in the Presidium as soon as possible.\n\nHe, and they, could not wait to get started."

 ultravisionary_flavor.10.d: "Ever since the establishment of the reformed Presidium, Dmitry Shepilov, the Federation's Minister of Finance, had had a most unenviable job: attempting to prevent initiatives that would lead, in short order, to state bankruptcy.\n\nDoing so required many late nights of work, and so when Shepilov first heard the proposal from Zhdanov - to move the ruble to a model where it was backed solely by state energy output - he thought he was hallucinating, hearing that which was brought on by exhaustion.\n\nBut as Zhdanov continued speaking, Shepilov realized the man was serious, and his confusion was swiftly replaced by abject horror. Zhdanov spoke, passionately and at length, about the many positives. But he ignored one critical problem: that to do so would immediately destroy any and all of the hard-won confidence in the ruble, as well as rendering foreign exchange impossible besides. And the Federation was not prepared for the imposition of effective autarky.\n\nIn desperation, Shepilov looked to the voices he knew to be rational - those of Nikolai Kardashev and Yekaterina Furtseva - and to his immense relief found them to be equally as horrified as himself. Exchanging slight nods of support, they prepared themselves for yet another careful repudiation of a 'visionary' initiative.\n\nWhen the debate and vote later came, they managed to successfully argue for the 'delay' of the 'excellent' idea, 'until such time as the entirety of the motherland could be liberated from occupying forces.'\n\nShepilov knew that the issue would return in the future. But for now, at least, he had staved off one more bankruptcy."

Dmitry Shepilov had once been one of those people. And then he was appointed to be its Minister of Finance.\n\nEvery single day since had been an exercise in either frustration or exasperation, and very often in both combined. The 'visionary' initiatives proposed by Zhdanov himself, or by his adherents if permitted were, to a one, utterly insane on a national scale, and nobody but himself and vanishingly few others seemed to realize this.\n\nConcepts that should have existed only in university laboratories, that should only have received small grants, if any at all, were suddenly introduced at the Presidium, assigned national priority, and allocated billions of rubles. The criteria for which often could be traced back to 'because the Paramount Leader had a visionary idea.'\n\nIt was no way to run a small business, let alone a recovering great power like Russia, and Shepilov often felt like the only man willing to say so. The one saving grace, the one thing he gave thanks for, was the discretion his position gave him. As the man ultimately in charge of implementing financial policy he could, as much as possible, rein in spending when Zhdanov and his clique were not looking. Which, given their focus on devising new 'visionary' efforts, was often.\n\nHe only hoped he could continue to do so, and find some allies besides. If not, he did not know how much longer he could keep up."

For every insane project he tempered, another was proposed. For every microwave cannon he delayed, a semiballistic transport aircraft was put into development. It never stopped. It was as if Zhdanov and his cohorts never slept.\n\nAnd the results, presented by the ledgers, were clear. Every time they were updated, reserves had decreased, the degree of deficit spending had increased, and creditors were willing to extend fewer and fewer resources. There was simply no way to reconcile the Federation's budget in order to support such 'visionary' initiatives while also ensuring basic civilian services in a nation still bearing the scars of decades of civil war.\n\nBut, try as he might, he could not build enough support in the Presidium to act as a proper counterbalance. Kardashev and Furtseva would back him, sometimes, but they had their own positions and goals to think about, and even together they could not entirely block a proposal. They could merely postpone. And he could not even act in such a way very often, if he wanted to keep his position at all.\n\nSoon, Shepilov knew, looking at the ledgers, the columns of which were written entirely in red ink, a threshold would be reached, and all his skill would not be enough to save the Federation. He just didn't know when that would happen."

An explorer of a period that would, in time, come to be known as one of abject recklessness. Of abject foolishness. Of, perhaps, abject insanity.\n\nHaving personally approved the funding of the campus, after expending his political capital in preventing a proposal for bullet train bridges from the Kola to Kanin Peninsulas, he knew that the resources spent on it could have otherwise allowed for significant increases in agricultural production in Central Siberia. On a project that could actually benefit the state in concrete fashion, both in the near- and long-term.\n\nBut that proposal had not been 'visionary' enough, and this one had. After all, without this complex, he remembered Chelomei proclaiming with absolute surety, how could they ever produce enough electroconductive fluid to permit exoplanetary mining operations?\n\nAs the director continued speaking at him, Shepilov turned to look at the buildings, ignoring the words. Would he, in time, revisit this place as a monument to works once thought 'great,' to those who thought ultravisionary projects an example of the might of the Federation?\n\nShepilov did not know. He was only a voice in the wilderness. But, sometimes, the wilderness could reclaim that from which it had been displaced. He only hoped he could be there when it happened."

When he was invited to speak to Zhdanov himself, he was giddy at being able to discuss science and earn prestige as a true visionary. He had expected a quiet setting, but as he had approached the room he could hear multiple voices speaking. So, with a huff, he listened at the door like an eavesdropper. It seemed people were being briefed on his theory.\n\n\"Effectively, there are three levels of civilization. Planetary, Stellar and Galactic, each defined by the resident society's control over their energy. Type I civilizations hold the ability to use and store all of their planet's energy. Type II civilizations do the same with their solar system. Type III do the same with the galaxy. We, of course, are not at any of these, but as the he has said, we may yet be one day. What makes this man a true visionary is he believes we can become a Planetary Civilization through socialism and cultural unity.\"\n\nNikolai tensed up as he heard a gentle murmur of approval and discussion. Rising to his full height and bracing himself, Nikolai opened the door to find a small group of men gathered around a table, with Zhdanov himself at the head. Each of them had a copy of two of his recent papers in their hands with annotations scrawled over them. \"There he is! Gentleman, this is Nikolai Kardashev. Nikolai, these are my most trusted advisors. It is a pleasure to meet you in the flesh.\" Zhdanov spoke quickly and moved to usher Kardashev into the room not letting him get a word in edgewise.\n\nFlustered, Kardashev began to respond, \"Well uh, I see you are all familiar with my work. I take it this is not the one on one meeting you posed this as, is it sir?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not. I come to you with a proposal, comrade - how would you like to join the State Planning Bureau, and lead us forward on this scale of your's?\"\n\n\"I, I guess so.\"\n\n\"Wonderful, just one last question, Mr. Kardashev: how about a new name for that scale of yours?\""

So when the Federation announced the creation of its ambitious space program, he had supported it, and became involved, wholeheartedly. He was not sure if that was still the case.\n\nThe catalyst for this change was the lunch he had just left with Vladimir Chelomei, one of the primary architects of the program as a whole. The man was undoubtedly a genius, and one whom Kardashev had long idolized. He was also, as Kardashev now knew, a man whose ideals were actively dangerous, not only to the space program, but for the Federation as a whole.\n\nWhile Kardashev had proposed reasonable exploration, the leveraging of zero-gravity environments for research, and a general program of safety and sustainability, Chelomei had almost immediately dismissed it. He, and the Paramount Leader as well, wanted nothing but the most ambitious projects possible.\n\nEnormous capsules and stations. Heavy-lift rockets using the most dangerous and unstable of fuel mixtures. Military applications. Not only was such a course indefensibly reckless, Kardashev knew, but it was also wholly unsustainable in terms of resources - human, financial, and otherwise.\n\nEven so, Kardashev thought upon reflection, what was he to do about it? Who would listen to him, or support him, if any objections were to be made? He knew he had to find somebody who would, somebody with influence. Somebody who would help.\n\nBefore it was too late."

The Federation's space program had begun, under the aegis of both the Commissariat for Energy and the Commissariat for Defense. As such he would be expected to work, closely, with Vladimir Chelomei.\n\nAlready, and as he had expected, Chelomei had begun speaking of how financial resources could be pooled, of how scientists could be re-assigned, and of how quickly he believed they could bring major projects - ones with direct military functionality - to fruition. At that, Kardashev had fought back.\n\nHe wanted to see careful progress made in fundamental advances before any end-stage initiatives could be realized. And he wanted economic, scientific, and civil uses given priority. The look Chelomei had given him when he had mentioned such uses was withering.\n\nBut Kardashev would not back down. He was no longer just another scientist. He was a Commissar just like Chelomei was, and he would make sure his voice was heard. He would work, as hard as possible, to ensure that the program could work sustainably to advance the cause of socialist science, regardless of what Chelomei said.\n\nKardashev suppressed a sigh, an action he knew would be repeated many times in the days to come. Why, he thought, had Zhdanov organized the program in such a way? As a venture between two major organs that could not help but have conflicting priorities?\n\nHe could find no satisfactory answer."

Licking the tip of his index finger, he pulled from the top, taking an idle sip of his drink (and wincing as it burned his tongue) as he began to read. The first proposal seemed promising. It called for the construction of a laser pistol which used a pyrotechnic flashbulb to blind targets and optical sensors. Yuri put that one in the 'keep' pile.\n\nThe next suggestion, titled 'Ape-Man', suggesting the creation of human-chimpanzee hybrids that would serve as Soviet supersoldiers, went into the discard pile immediately.\n\nHours passed, and Yuri had read and reviewed dozens of Visionary science proposals. For every genuinely good idea, such as hovercraft, biodomes, hybridized crops, nuke-proof towns, there were three genuinely awful ideas. These included constructing robotic harnesses that would latch onto corpses and then be propelled by the inevitable miasma, a gun that would fire a ray into the head of the user to allow them to remember any event (extremely radioactive), and a highly improbable suggestion that proposed a species of regenerating cattle that could be used for infinite meat.\n\nYuri sighed. At least he could laugh with his workmates about some of the more ludicrous suggestions. As the day ended, Yuri punched out and headed home for his flat. That night, he was haunted by shrieking Ape-Men and rotting sharks with clinking, metallic legs.

You will be reassigned to another project, to the fringes, where, maybe, you can finally understand how much destruction these thoughts have brought us.

Kardashev had no experience running an organization this large. He was going to need help. Kardashev took a folder from the stack positioned upon his desk.

The cold faced man had been wondering whom could be blamed for such discord incited failings?\n\nMikhail Suslov had been going over names: Lazar Kaganovich, Leon Trotsky, Vyacheslav Molotov. All of them had been personally involved themselves into factionalism, through backing a candidate for the post of General Secretary of the Soviet Union, backing themselves or instigated conflict in a dire period of history for the Union and its people: Trotsky had been part of the friction in the Union's early years after Lenin's death, having lusted to become General Secretary before ultimately losing to Bukharin, while Kaganovich and Molotov had been loyal lapdogs of Stalin in his own quest for the Soviet throne, though Suslov would've dismissed his name from the list if not for being an influenceable member of the party, susceptible to outside influences and merely those that his wife were sympathetic to.\n\nA slow realisation came to burgeon in his mind as the man continued to write, words flowing from the tips of his fingers.\n\n\"Even if our party today is united and undivisible, it'd be foolish to say that it had always been the case. It has come to my attention that the actions of past members such as Kaganovich, Trotsky and Molotov might've been due to outside influences contrary to Lenin's ideals.\n\nOne would describle them as akin to cosmopolitan bankers, showing themselves to be prisoners of bourgeois Zionist ideology, a characteristic shared by rootless cosmopolites abroad. As evident by the subversive, anti-Soviet behavior of Kaganovich, Trotsky, and Molotov, ties to Zionist elements betrays a tendency to be beheld to capitalist foreign associations.\""

After a couple of minutes, the group of communists finally found themselves in a poorly lit room, the elder man seemingly finding it difficult to find the lightswitch. Finally, after fumbling for what seemed like an eternity, lights were turned on and something instantly drawn Mikhail's attention: huge metal shelves closely knitted together, a layers of buttons running across the lot of them, electronics littering its facade.\n\n\"A true state of the art work. Well, technically the first and only one of its kind here. Pure Soviet design and conception. Its complex capabilities shall surely be a boon to our administration matters, perhaps even a boon in other state matters.\"\n\nHe was shyly scrutinizing Suslov's face, trying to see a hint of emotion that could betray the cold facade he put up in front of others. Yet, the General Secretary stood there, cold faced as ever, contemplating what this breakthrough meant for the party, its bureaucracy, its future."
 suslov.29.a: "A window to the future indeed."
 suslov.30.t: "A Creeping Fear"
 suslov.30.d: "Yet again, Suslov found himself deep in thoughts as he recollected the events of the past few weeks, a creeping feeling of fear keeping him awake late in the evening: though the party had came into power, Mikhail still found himself dubitative on the topic of unity and loyalty within the party, his fears of factionalism and, worse, revisionist tendencies that some members may hold, might undermine his efforts to preserve an image off strong party unity.\n\nOne could look at his face and see nothing but a stern man, unmovable, impassive. But Suslov remained human in spite of the image he tried to uphold, one that couldn't help but find himself wondering if his efforts in bringing the Soviet Union, one being run by democratic collective rule, will ever prove successful or if he'll fail like so many others before him: a footnote in history."

 iainmbanks.7.d: "Despite the miserable weather outside, the environment within the basement of the Orenburg Polytechnic Institute's student center was warm and friendly. Alcohol, tobacco smoke, and the occasional flirtatious caress flowed freely between the occupants, as deviant discussion and fraught revisionism filled the air.\n\nOn the periphery of the basement, between a young man who was excitedly sharing a passage from his newly written pamphlet, and a red-clad woman who was scandalously stroking her hair, a striking black-clad woman reclined, engrossed in the sounds and experiences. She noted the words spoken, and the materials shared; the substances consumed and acts carried out. Even as she turned her head to break the law one more time that night, each action was entered into her trained mental litany.\n\nThe woman, of course, was a member of the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances, a star agent of the United Soviet Federation's infamous spy agency. Throughout the gathering, there were no less than three informants - one in each \"cell\" of the so-called \"Visionary Humanist Society\". She avoided acknowledging them as she processed the young man's statement about \"voluntary auto-collectivization\" and \"inherent noospheric individualism\" - important ideological concepts that would have to be noted.\n\nThe \"Anarcho-Ultravisionarist\" society that surrounded her, in truth, was not a threat in totality. Their rank-and-file could be scattered to the winds at a token threat of force, and their leaders merely given a touch of re-education. Their minds were in the right place - but their hearts bled for far too many.\n\nWith one last taste of lipstick, she excused herself to both of her new associates, and slipped into the night - a stack of pamphlets tucked into her handbag, and a list of names burned into her memory."

 iainmbanks.8.d: "MEMORANDUM\n\nFrom: Station Head Smirnov\n\nTo: Director Semichastny\n\nDate: [GetDate]\n\nSubject: Specifics regarding deviances in Orenburg district.\n\nReport: Over past two months, GoI-088 \"Visionary Humanist Society\" successfully contacted and infiltrated.

 iainmbanks.9.t: "An Invitation"
 iainmbanks.9.d: "Vasily trudged home through the snow outside his apartment building. It was twilight outside, and the shadows were looming long and low across the street. With a practiced step, he slipped into the lobby and down the hall, checking the locks on his door for signs of tampering. Satisfied by the result, he unlocked them - just the first and third, as was custom, and stepped inside.\n\nHis heart nearly stopped, as he looked at the unassuming black-clad man sitting at the table in his kitchen, smoking a cigarette. His hand dropped to his coat pocket, where he kept his revolver, before freezing. The man's voice cut through the silence, interrupting his breathing.\n\n\"Comrade Lebedev, Vasily Alexandrovich. Good evening.\"\n\nHe didn't have a response for that, instead searching the man for insignia. Nothing. A trickle of ice dripped down his spine, as he made the connection.\n\n\"So. What am I being arrested for?\"\n\nThe man chuckled, before beckoning for him to sit down.\n\n\"Consider yourself innocent, Comrade Lebedev. I have a proposition for you. An opening has opened up for you.\"\n\nHe relaxed a bit. He could work with that.\n\n\"Well. Tell me what you're offering.\""
 iainmbanks.9.a: "Into the dark side."
 iainmbanks.10.t: "Words in the Dark"
 iainmbanks.10.d: "The conversation had flowed from the moment he sat down across the table from him. Tales of a past that the man somehow had heard of, and commendations for a service primarily carried out in the dark. Vasily knew what he was looking for, at this point - but all that remained was to tease out a few more precious morsels of data.\n\n\"...and what capacity would I be operating?\"\n\n\"Full Captain, your old rank. Of course, now you'd be working for us. Special Circumstances. Everything you do for us would be hush-hush.\"\n\nVasily cracked a smile at that. He'd heard rumors, of course... but he'd never imagined he'd be approached.\n\n\"A spy?\"\n\n\"A spy, but with excellent benefits. An agent of the Federation - rather than a mere guard for the Mountain..\"\n\nHe wasn't surprised. SC was rumoured to be the absolute peak of the intelligence apparatus. It was better than what he expected.\n\n\"I don't know if I'm ready to put on the uniform again,\" said Vasily. \"I like not getting shot at. The soft life.\"\n\nHe gestured at the fading wallpaper, the bricks showing through in a few places. The kettle, repurposed from some piece of cheap equipment made in the bowels of Lysenko's former fortress.\n\n\"I'm willing to offer you a tour, comrade. Consider it a probationary term. Do this for a day. See if you like the way we operate.\"\n\nVasily mulled it over. 'What color is the uniform?'\n\nThe man smiled, an expression that carried no lack of malice. \"Matte black.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Vasily, hoping that he wouldn't regret it."
 iainmbanks.10.a: "\"I'm in.\""
 kurchatov.1.t: "A Happy Retirement"
 kurchatov.1.d: "When Igor Kurchatov, the Vice Premier of the Presidium, announced a surprise addition to the agenda at the end of a meeting, many of its members feared what possible surprise they were going to spring on them. Perhaps, some thought, it was a scientific proposal that he couldn't wait to shove down their throats, knowing his status as Zhdanov's successor made him immune to normal parliamentary procedures. Others, more paranoid, feared it was the beginning of a round of purges, to prepare the way for Kurchatov's eventual takeover.\n\nAs it happened, neither of those possibilities happened.\n\n\"Comrades,\" he began, his voice trembling a little, \"I regret to inform you that I will be retiring from public life as soon as I am free to do so.\"\n\nThe room collectively held its breath, as he continued, stating that his age made his position as Vice Premier a \"burden\" and that \"a newer, younger generation\" would best be sought to replace him in six month's time, his official retirement date. What double entendres occurred were obvious, as Zhdanov, sitting right beside him, looked nervously at the members of the Presidium.\n\nWhen Kurchatov finished, he was greeted with applause from the Presidium and Zhdanov. The chamber even passed a resolution with debate thanking him for his service to his countryman and to the workers' movement. But few could ignore the new energy in the room, as the fears and ambition of men came towards the fore."
 kurchatov.1.a: "Let's hope Zhdanov chooses someone younger as his successor."
 kurchatov.2.t: "An Ultravisionary Meeting"
 kurchatov.2.d: "Neither Nikolai Kardashev nor Vladimir Chelomei knew, when they entered the office of Vice Premier Igor Kurchatov, of the cataclysmic announcement that he was to make.\n\nTypically, he did not meet with both at the same time - their wildly different commissarial portfolios had little direct overlap in state policy - and when each saw the other, attention was focused. A portent had been simultaneously observed and understood.\n\nAnd, just as quickly, it was answered. Kurchatov announced to the two men that he would, in the very near future, be announcing his retirement. The time had come for change, he had said, both for the Federation and for himself, and he had no intention of overstaying his welcome.\n\nBoth Kardashev and Chelomei immediately understood the situation and their own place within it, as both saw their opportunity to replace Kurchatov and thereby increase their influence over the Federation's direction. It would be a difficult case to make, indeed, but the reward was well worth it.\n\nWorking hard not to betray their intentions to the other, or to Kurchatov himself, the two men offered their support for their superior's decision as well as their thanks for his long and successful service, and departed soon after. Once out of sight, however, they began to move with increased speed.\n\nThe race was on. For the position itself, of course, but also for securing the political support needed to obtain it."

 kurchatov.3.t: "The Race Begins"
 kurchatov.3.d: "Kurchatov was retiring. Not only that, but he had called Vladmir himself to the announcement- doubtless, a little hint as to who he wanted to take his place. However; Vladimir hadn't been the only one called. Nikolai Kardashev, that bumbling, nervous, yet simultaneously brilliant idealist was his competition- and the race was on. Back into his office at the People's Commissariat of Defense he strutted; giving nods to officers and staffers as he sat at his seat.\n\nThe race was on; and he'd need to get as much support as he could- Furtseva, Varennikov and Zhdanov himself were easy support- the committees could bend his way, and even Semichastny's enigmatic Special Circumstances Directorate could probably be reasoned with; leaving it an easy climb... unless Kardashev could steal his support. The Old Reformers had to be silenced, his position had to be solidified...\n\nWhat seemed like an easy cakewalk was becoming more and more of a challenge; much to his annoyance. But- it was Kardashev. Would he really be that much of an issue?"
 kurchatov.3.a: "Even so, slow and steady wins the race."
 kurchatov.4.t: "The Race Begins"
 kurchatov.4.d: "Nikolai Kardashev was not sure if he was excited, panicked, or going to faint- though it was probably a bit of all three. Kurchatov was retiring; and he had called Nikolai and Vladmir to his office to tell them that- it was a race. And for Nikolai, it wouldn't be in his favor. Unless he could somehow convince Zhdanov, the committees... A pause, as he sprinted towards his office at the People's Commissariat of Energy, taking names. Numbers. The intelligence services. Old Reformers. Oplesnin. The People's Commissar of Industry- and he'd have to convince several of them. Vladmir Chelomei was charismatic and suave- yet abrasive and self assured. There was still a chance; but Kardashev couldn't sit on his laurels and just hope. So, as minutes faded into hours, and hours faded into the evening, he remained at his desk- taking notes and doing his best to remember everyone he could."
 kurchatov.4.a: "Haste is not always wasteful."
 kurchatov.5.t: "An Ultravisionary Retirement"
 kurchatov.5.d: "Seated in his large office, and exploiting its commanding view over the Federation's capital, Igor Kurchatov reflected on both his performance and his overall legacy to the Federation, and smiled.\n\nHe had done well, he decided, tapping his pen on the latest stack of reports. The cause of Ultravisionary Socialism had advanced tremendously, and while the Paramount Leader was of course the man most responsible for that advancement, he knew he had been instrumental in helping him do so. But the time had come to hand over the reins, and enjoy a retirement long deserved.\n\nKurchatov had seen the looks in both Kardashev and Chelomei's eyes when he had told them of his decision. It was, after all, why he had summoned them. Both had seen a chance to replace him, and he was sure that, even now, they were frantically moving to secure support. It would be a most interesting competition to watch, especially since he did not particularly care about the outcome.\n\nBoth men, despite their vastly different outlooks, were visionaries. Both would hold the Federation in secure hands. Both would continue its journey towards the future - in all fields.\n\nAnd at that thought, he smiled again."
 kurchatov.5.a: "The race has begun."
 kurchatov.6.t: "Approaching Furtseva"
 kurchatov.6.d: "The building that housed the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs was only a short walk from Chelomei's office, and the bureaucrats and officials that resided within its walls pointed him towards Yekaterina Furtseva's office without wasting his time.s\n\n\"People's Commissar of Defense, whatever brings you to my office?\" asked Furtseva, shaking Chelomei's hand before returning to her seat.\n\n\"I assume you've heard about Comrade Kurchatov's retirement?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am fully aware of his retirement, and I am fully aware why you are bringing it up to me. You want my support for you to become Vice Premier.\"\n\n\"Yes, comrade, and that's why I have come to you before all others. Your magnificent work in strengthening and upholding the Ultravisonary superculture has been nothing short of amazing. The projects you and your Commissariat have proposed continue to show promising results, and I do not wish to see them scrapped anytime soon. If you back me as Vice Premier, I'll ensure ample support and funding comes to your Commissariat so that you can continue your work however you please. Do you find that agreeable?\" Furtseva was silent for a moment as she considered the offer. After what felt like an eternity, she finally replied.\n\n\"Yes, comrade, I do. I hope you can fulfill your grand promises.\""
 kurchatov.6.a: "\"I shall not disappoint you, comrade.\""
 kurchatov.7.t: "The Forgotten Commissariat"
 kurchatov.7.d: "The People's Commissariat of Finance was a surprisingly long walk from Kardashev's office, and while the building had that Ultravisionary flair, it was not nearly as bombastic or as eye-catching as the other government buildings that Kardashev had visited. Eventually, Kardashev was able to find Dmitri Shepilov's small office, the door squeaking as he entered the room.\n\n\"You want me to support you as Vice Premier?\" asked Shepilov, his voice full of apprehension.\n\n\"Yes, comrade, I do. I understand that the current policies and budgets-\"\n\n\"What budgets?! Every half-baked madman is given a blank check without so much as a glance towards my office!\"\n\nKardashev paused to allow Shepilov to calm down before continuing, \"Y-Yes, comrade, I am fully aware. I promise to you that I will also evaluate the situation regarding our debt-\"\n\n\"Just don't, comrade. Don't mention the debt. For my sanity's sake, please...\"\n\n\"U-understood. I hope that you can see me as the more pragmatic and responsible candidate, and-\"\n\n\"Fine. You have my support, I hope you don't make me regret this decision.\""
 kurchatov.7.a: "\"Um... thank you, comrade. I shall do my best.\""
 kurchatov.8.t: "Looking Ahead"
 kurchatov.8.d: "Chelomei swallowed. Not so much nervous of Zhdanov, but wary of what the future might hold. As of late, factionalism, that old devil of all socialist movements, had begun to rear its ugly head within the communists of the United Soviet Federation. Zhdanov, he sincerely hoped, would recognize the potential dangers ahead.\n\n\"Comrade Zhdanov,\" said Chelomei, breaking the sacred silence that hung over the office, the senior party official looking up from his paperwork. He smiled, his fleshy face spreading into a grin.\n\n\"Ah, Vladimir, welcome. Forgive me, I was lost in the day-to-day of statework. Take a seat and make yourself at home.\"\n\nChelomei nodded and did so, scooting closer to the oaken desk. \"Comrade Zhdanov, I will be frank: the party is not as impregnable to fragmentation as we would like to believe. I am not here to make accusations against anyone, that is far outside my purview,\" Chelomei added quickly as Zhdanov frowned. \"We must face the facts, Comrade Zhdanov, you are not immortal. One day, the time will come to seek a replacement.\"\n\nZhdanov nodded, \"of course, Vladimir. Don't think I can't smell the wolves circling around us. The United Soviet Federation is, well, a mess of division. Rest assured, we will ensure that the transition of power is as orderly as possible.\"\n\nChelomei sighed in relief. Conversation continued late into the night, Chelomei's heart weighing a little lighter."
 kurchatov.8.a: "The halls of power secured?"
 kurchatov.9.t: "A Matter of Rocks and Atomics"
 kurchatov.9.d: "Kardashev had set up his projector and slides just so, eagerly awaiting the arrival of Zhdanov. He felt like a schoolboy again, ready to give his presentation on sea otters to his class, the eyes of the schoolmaster boring into the side of his head. But Zhdanov was not his wiry old schoolmaster, no, Zhdanov was far more important, the stakes for disappointing him far greater.\n\nIt was almost a relief when Zhdanov entered the room, a polite smile flashing across his wide face before he took a seat. \"Please, Comrade Kardashev, you may begin.\" Kardashev nodded, sweat forming on his brow from the heat of the projector and his own nerves.\n\n\"What I am most pleased to present to you, Comrade Zhdanov, is the potential for a fusion-based fuel economy. Petroleum will, as we know, run dry. If we are looking towards the future, towards the stars, we need an unlimited source of fuel.\"\n\nZhdanov nodded, silently urging Kardashev to continue. \"The answer is fusion. With the proper materials we could provide unlimited energy for the Soviet Federation and for our space program.\"\n\nZhdanov held up a hand, \"you're speaking of a long, God, long term project. The infrastructure alone would take years to establish. Kardashev, this is, assuming it could be pulled off.\" Kardashev cleared his throat, nervously contemplating his next words, a great deal hinged on what he said next."
 kurchatov.9.a: "Downplay its importance, it can wait with the Presidium's choice of succession."
 kurchatov.9.b: "Play up fusion's importance."
 kurchatov.9.c: "Promise the world. Fusion is the best way into the future."
 kurchatov.10.t: "Status Quo"
 kurchatov.10.d: "A sigh of relief whistled quietly out from between Kardashev's teeth like a warm breeze through a valley. The piece of paper he held in his hands may as well have been his stay of execution, at least on a political scale. Kardashev sat in his chair, reading it again and again, ease settling into the pit of his stomach a little more each time he scanned over the lines.\n\n\"Comrade Kardashev,\" the letter began, \"rest assured that I have complete confidence in whatever candidate the Presidium chooses in regards to your fusion project. Do not concern yourself overmuch with matters of state, but know that your project will come to rest in capable hands. Regards, Zhdanov.\"\n\nPeace of mind, thought Kardashev, that's what the letter represented. Now, with some luck, his project could move forwards, the United Soviet Federation creeping just a little closer to the stars."
 kurchatov.10.a: "We'll soon be escaping to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism."
 kurchatov.11.t: "Clandestine Meetings"
 kurchatov.11.d: "\"Shit,\" muttered Kardashev, staring at the piece of paper clutched in his hands. An ally of his had discretely slipped the letter into Kardashev's hands minutes before while passing through the hallway and the contents were less than pleasant.\n\nWhile Kardashev had met with Zhdanov and impressed upon him the importance of a fusion-based fuel economy, as well as, subtly, the importance of remaining neutral in the matter of succession, it seems someone else had the same idea. Vladimir Chelomei, a lurker in the halls of power, had apparently been secreted away with Comrade Zhdanov in unofficial meetings. The implications of this were less than stellar for Kardashev: he likely no longer had Zhdanov's ear in the succession matter.\n\nKardashev slid back into his chair, absently rubbing his race. What was his next move? If Zhdanov couldn't be counted upon to have his back, then who could? He felt isolated, trapped in the center of a great web: the most horrible aspect of which was not knowing where the spider was."
 kurchatov.11.a: "What's next?"
 kurchatov.12.t: "Old Enemies or New Friends?"
 kurchatov.12.d: "The man's name wasn't important, and Chelomei was careful not to record it in the notes he took afterwards just in case. He was nervous, fidgety, uncomfortable in his chair and skin alike. A little hat sat atop his head, sunglasses hiding his face, mustache quivering under a rabbit's twitching nose. Chelomei had not announced his intentions from the start, but the man's demeanour meant that he knew something was up. \"Hello, comrade,\" began Chelomei, not unkindly, \"I'm not going to ask you to confirm or deny anything, anonymity is key to us both at this juncture.\"\n\nA nervous scoff, a forced laugh, \"what are you talking about? Is this an investigation? Ask anyone and they'll tell you I'm beyond reproach, I-\" Chelomei held up a hand to silence the man's whimpering protests, his demeanor spoke volumes.\n\n\"Comrade, calm yourself, I am not here to prosecute anyone. However, prosecution is a matter I have come here to discuss...\"\n\nThe false bluster in the man died suddenly, like a sailboat in dead wind. Defeat crept across his face. \"I see, what...what do I have to do? A bribe for my life?\"\n\nChelomei shook his head, \"no, nothing like that. In fact, I am on your side. You and I could help one another a great deal, comrade. This persecution of your Old Reformers could ease, certain parties pardoned, quietly, from prison.\" A silence fell across the room, the man chewing on the words. \"Think about it, comrade, I can offer you\":"
 kurchatov.12.a: "An end to persecution."
 kurchatov.12.b: "Quiet releases from prison and small recompense."
 kurchatov.12.c: "Total pardoning, perhaps reinstatement of positions."
 kurchatov.13.t: "新たな友人"
 kurchatov.13.d: "The man hung his head, defeated yet elated. \"Okay, comrade,\" he said, \"if what you say is true, and God, I hope it is, we are in your debt. Whatever you need, we'll do our best to provide.\" Chelomei smiled, a grandfatherly grin. His trap had closed expertly, his gamble paid off. Now, all he had to do was push things forwards.\n\n\"Hold tight, comrade,\" he said, extending a hand to gently touch the top of the nervous man's fingers, \"stay to your posts and when the time is right, I'm certain you will come through for me.\" The meeting was concluded, the two conspirators, for that is what they were now, departed on their separate ways. Chelomei breathed a sigh of relief. The Old Reformers were in his pocket, by hook and a little bit of crook, let Kardashev steal the succession from under him now."
 kurchatov.13.a: "Here's to new friendships."
 kurchatov.14.t: "Old Enemies"
 kurchatov.14.d: "Suddenly, the weak little man was gone, replaced by a sudden and genuine fierceness. \"No, comrade, I'm afraid that we can't come to an accord.\" He stood up, mustache shaking like a epilectic caterpillar. \"Who are YOU to dare shove us into a corner? We're not some pawns of the Presidium! We make our own fate, we won't let it be dictated to us by some, some,\" he seemed to struggle with his words for a moment, Chelomei grimacing and pushing his seat back a bit. \"Crony!\" the man shouted, suddenly finding what he was looking for.\n\nChelomei put up his hands, \"very well, fine, no deal.\" He stood up, pushing his chair in, meeting the furious gaze of this nobody he had bothered to contact. \"Have a fine day, comrade.\"\n\nChelomei left the room, deeply upset, but quietly so. That moron! That stuffed-up fool! Kardashev. Fuck. That bastard would easily swoop up the Old Reformers if he desired to. The battle for succession would grow more bitter indeed."
 kurchatov.14.a: "Fine. Be that way, then."
 kurchatov.15.t: "A Little Talk Over Drinks"
 kurchatov.15.d: "The evening had been pleasant, the talk light and enjoyable. Kardashev and his friend, Yuri, had enjoyed several glasses of wine in the comfort of Kardashev's home. Now, as the night was winding down, the conversation took a more serious turn. Kardashev was careful how he inserted his question. \"Yuri, don't think you have to answer, I merely wish you to know.\" Yuri raised an eyebrow, curious, not alarmed.\n\n\"Yes?\" asked Yuri, taking a sip of his wine and letting the liquid burn pleasantly on his tongue, \"what are you about to say?\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, if you know of any, shall we say, persecuted elements, tell them that they have a friend in Kardashev.\" Kardashev wasn't a brilliant wordsmith, his delivery awkward and his tone clear, but it worked its intended effect upon Yuri.\n\n\"Yes, of course!\" said Yuri suddenly, clear excitement on his face. He beamed, subtly eased. \"My friend, I'll be sure to pass along the message. Regrettably, looking at the time, I'm afraid I must take my leave.\" Yuri exited hastily, patting Kardashev on his back and shut the door behind him. Kardashev smiled, the pieces were falling in place."
 kurchatov.15.a: "Thank god that worked."
 kurchatov.16.t: "Its Own Reward"
 kurchatov.16.d: "Kardashev glanced up from his work as he heard the footsteps of the mail carrier on his front step. Placing down his pencil and listening as the steps faded, he slowly rose to his feet and left his study. Approaching the front door, he bent down to pick up an envelope that had dropped through his mail slot. Strangely, it lacked a return address or a stamp. Sliding the latch on his door, he peered out into the street and saw no sign of a postal worker - this letter had been delivered by hand.\n\nOpening the envelope, he began to read.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Kardashev\n\nYou do not know who I am, and I would like to keep it that way, as my position in this country is tenuous. I have been fought every step of my career by the establishment under your colleagues, but I find myself thanking you. I have been informed that you and others loyal to you are sympathetic to the plight of people like me, and thus, I am humbly thanking you for your work and hope you continue to do so in the future. Thank you, Mr Kardashev. You can count on my support, in whatever capacity I and others like me can offer it.\n\nSincerely, A New Friend.\"\n\nA subtle smile crossed the physicist's face as he finished reading the anonymous letter. Happy and a good bit prideful, he stood back up straight and went to make sure the letter was disposed of, for the sake of his New Friend."
 kurchatov.16.a: "What a nice fellow."
 kurchatov.17.t: "Meeting with Keldysh"
 kurchatov.17.d: "\"I am glad to be able to speak with you in private, Comrade Keldysh,\" said Chelomei as he sat down with the People's Commissar of Science. Such a powerful ally would be invaluable in Chelomei's bid for Kurchatov's position.\n\n\"We both know why you're here. What can you offer me that other candidates won't? Why should the People's Commissariat of Science support you?\"\n\n\"I'm glad you asked. The People's Commissariat of Science is an invaluable asset of the Federation. However, we're squandering that asset's potential by spreading it too thin. We need to focus your efforts, ensure that your efforts do not go to waste. I think the People's Commissariat should focus on projects that strengthen our army, and strengthen the revolution.\"\n\n\"Do elaborate, comrade. I'm interested in hearing what projects this would entail.\"\n\n\"I'm talking about things like rockets. Alternative forms of weaponry. Even mind control. If the revolution is to succeed, then we need to obtain every advantage possible. There will of course be funding for more mundane science, but that type of thing doesn't really fit the Ultravisionary spirit, now does it?\"\n\n\"You've certainly intrigued me comrade, I must admit. Could I ask you to repeat some of that again? I want to have written proof so that I don't forget anything later.\""
 kurchatov.17.a: "\"I want to bring the Revolution brought to Mars by 1980, and we'll need your brilliance to get there.\""
 kurchatov.17.b: "\"Weapons, rockets, mind control. You name it, we'll fund it.\""
 kurchatov.17.c: "\"The revolution can't succeed without a cutting-edge military. I want every advantage possible.\""
 kurchatov.18.t: "偉大なる精神"
 kurchatov.18.d: "Chelomei looked over the unopened letter in his hands. He had made some bold promises to Mstislav Keldysh, and he hoped that Keldysh would see the opportunities that Chelomei could provide. He took out his letter opener, and extracted the paper. Clearly the People's Commissar of Science had written the document in a hurry, and Chelomei had to squint to decipher the man's handwriting.\n\n\"Comrade Chelomei,\n\nI have thought about our last conversation for some time. The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nThat is why I have decided to support you for Vice Premier, and you can depend upon my vote when the time comes on the Presidium. I hope you uphold your promises. I understand you expect great things from us, but we also expect great things of you.\"\n\nChelomei leaned back in his chair, a smile stretching across his face. This was good news. Chelomei was getting ever closer to that coveted Vice Premiership. With the People's Commissariats for Foreign Affairs and Science on his side, the core pillars of Ultravisionary Socialism were on Chelomei's side."
 kurchatov.18.a: "Great minds think alike, comrade."
 kurchatov.19.t: "Impartial Science"
 kurchatov.19.d: "Chelomei opened the envelope and pulled out Mstislav Keldysh's letter. He felt like his conversation with the People's Commissar of Science had been productive, and hoped that this letter carried good news. The letter was handwritten, and it took a moment for Chelomei to decipher the letter's contents.\n\n\"Comrade Chelomei,\n\nI have thought about our last conversation for some time. The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nHowever, science must always strive to be impartial. The People's Commissariat of Science is an important pillar of the Federation, and we must not let our revolution fall into factionalism. As such, I can not in good faith commit to any candidates at this time...\"\n\nChelomei crumpled up the letter and threw it in the garbage bin by his feet. Impartiality! Factionalism! What nonsense! At least they were remaining neutral on the matter. CHelomei could salvage this, there were still potential allies that he could sway to his side."
 kurchatov.19.a: "They've become blinded by their hubris."
 kurchatov.20.t: "Meeting with Keldysh"
 kurchatov.20.d: "Kardashev was surprised to be handed a letter by his secretary. Apparently, Comrade Keldysh had decided to respond after all. Once Kardashev was alone in his office, he opened the envelope and began reading the letter. He hoped it was good news.\n\n\"Comrade Kardashev,\n\nI've been thinking over our previous conversation, and I've had to rewrite this letter multiple times to truly put my thoughts into words. I've become infatuated with soem of the ideas we discussed, and I think there are some brilliant ideas that we must further explore. I had some of my scientists look into nuclear fusion, and it looks like...\"\n\nKardashev was surprised at how long the letter was, and quickly skimmed over it to see what Keldysh had to say about Kardashev's bid for Vice Premier. After scanning both sides of the first piece of paper, Kardashev moved onto the second.\n\n\"... In regards to the matter of Kurchatov's retirement, I think you would be an excellent choice for his successor. You have my support,\" the People's Commissar of Science had crammed the two sentences at the bottom of the page, with no room left for a signature. Kardashev thought that that was a good sign."
 kurchatov.20.a: "If we could redirect asteroids and obtain their resources... the possibilities would be endless."
 kurchatov.20.b: "The secrets of nuclear fusion must be cracked. We must master the genome."
 kurchatov.20.c: "Remember the people. Fusion, genetic engineering, that is the science we need."
 kurchatov.21.t: "Infinite Possibilities"
 kurchatov.21.d: "Kardashev was surprised to be handed a letter by his secretary. Apparently, Comrade Keldysh had decided to respond after all. Once Kardashev was alone in his office, he opened the envelope and began reading the letter. He hoped it was good news.\n\n\"Comrade Kardashev,\n\nI've been thinking over our previous conversation, and I've had to rewrite this letter multiple times to truly put my thoughts into words.

You have my support,\" the People's Commissar of Science had crammed the two sentences at the bottom of the page, with no room left for a signature. Kardashev thought that that was a good sign."
 kurchatov.21.a: "I applaud his enthusiasm."
 kurchatov.22.t: "A Letter from Keldysh"
 kurchatov.22.d: "It had been nearly a week since Kardashev had talked with the People's Commissar of Science, and he hadn't heard a word from him since. Keldysh hadn't seemed particularly enthusiastic when he left Kardashev's office, but Kardashev had thought that their conversation had been very productive. Today, however, his secretary stopped him as he was entering his office, carrying a folded piece of paper. It was from Keldysh.\n\n\"Comrade Kardashev,\n\nI have thought about our last conversation for some time. The position of Vice Premier is an important one, and I wish only for the best candidate to lead the Federation.\n\nHowever, science must always strive to be impartial. The People's Commissariat of Science is an important pillar of the Federation, and we must not let our revolution fall into factionalism. As such, I can not in good faith commit to any candidates at this time. I hope, as a fellow scientist, you can understand my position. We merely wish the best for the Federation, and we only wish the best for science.\"\n\nKardashev put the paper down on his desk. That wasn't good. Maybe the other People's Commissariats would be more agreeable. Kardashev only hoped that they would remain true to their word, and remain neutral in the vote."
 kurchatov.22.a: "In their pursuit of science, they have forgotten their true purpose."
 kurchatov.23.t: "The Long Search"
 kurchatov.23.d: "Vladmir Chelomei was not used to asking for directions or instructions from people; nor was he used to receiving anything that wasn't a straight answer. Thus when he started asking people for the location of the basement of the People's Commissariat of Aquatic Transport, he was not expecting evasiveness.\n\nHe certainly wasn't expecting the first response to be \"What basement?\" as the receptionist eyed him with confusion. \"The basement. Do not take me for a fool; I wish to speak with the Director of Special Circumstances.\" \"Who is... in our basement.\" She replied, giving him a look of utter derision. \"Which doesn't exist. I have been here for years, and we've never-\" Onto the next person, while she stared at him dumbfoundedly.\n\n\"I am here looking for Special Circumstance's headquarters- where is the basement?\"\n\n\"What basement?\" Vladimir blinked. \"The basement. Special Circumstances headquarters...\" \"Comrade, in my many years of working here, we have never had a basement.\"\n\nThey can't be serious, can they? This has to be some form of joke, or some private mockery. Is Semichastny working with Kardashev, or was the location Chelomei was given wrong? No, no, it can't be wrong- Chelomei himself personally traced the rumors. Clearly, these people are either mocking him or simply idiots. Thus, he continued his long search. \"I am looking for the basement.\" He stated- as he swung open a door dramatically. Closet. Bathroom. Storage room. \"What basement?\" Break room. Office. \"The basement, comrade. I know you have one. Stop trying to hide it from me.\" Could it be a trapdoor? Behind a bookshelf? It has to be somewhere. If Vladmir Chelomei-\n\nA pause, as a hand taps on his shoulder, before resting on it. \"Follow me, comrade.\" A voice spoke, as a black clothed, plain looking individual walked towards the closet he had swung open, entering- and opening a door behind a grouping of uniforms and shoeboxes, turning to him."
 kurchatov.23.a: "\"In.\""
 kurchatov.231.t: "The Basement"
 kurchatov.231.d: "The headquarters of the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances was large. It was far less of a basement and more of a sublevel of the building; with plenty of spacious offices, monitoring stations, and staff flooding through it. Agents in matte black uniforms with swordlike emblems strutted to and fro without a care, and Vladmir Chelomei did his best to hold his tongue- despite spending thirty five minutes hunting for such a large location. \"Where is Semichastny's office? I need to speak to him about urgent-\"\n\n\"Follow.\" The agent leading him spoke, moving to a large room covered in chairs, firmly pausing once he was inside. \"Wait.\"\n\nFor a moment, Chelomei considered his options- before sitting down in a chair and waiting. There was no television. There were no books. There were no other individuals waiting, and aside from the cold comfort of the quiet agent, Vladimir Chelomei was alone. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity the door opened, and he was led in utter silence to a desk. Plain, aside from the same swordlike emblem on the front of it that the agents seemed to have, and only having one occupant- Vladimir Semichastny, who was looking at papers.\n\n\"I-\" \"Am here to ask for my support.\" Semichastny interrupted, not even bothering to look up. \"You have it.\" Chelomi blinked, as the agent motioned to the door, and Semichastny did not give him so much as a passing glance. The only acknowledgement he got was a single reflexive look up as the door shut between the two- as the agent led Chelomei up and out."
 kurchatov.231.a: "A letter or a phone call would have been nice..."
 kurchatov.24.t: "Long Hours"
 kurchatov.24.d: "Nikolai Kardashev had no clue where the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances was; and apparently neither did anyone else. No matter who he asked, there didn't seem to be an answer. Rather- a straight answer. \"I'm pretty sure it's in... one of those buildings.\" An aide pointed to a map, as Nikolai blinked, before nodding as he made his way through and around them. The Directorate of Agriculture? No. \"Perhaps if you'd try the People's Commissariat of Aquatic Transport...\" No. \"I don't know who told you to look here, but perhaps...\"\n\nDown more streets he walked, and got more and more dismissals, or directions that led nowhere- before a single flicker of hope. A single, matte black clad woman in a leather coat stood at a street corner with a cigarette in her mouth, a small accessory to their apathetic stare as they observed his approach. \"Excuse me, Ma'm. I am looking for the Directorate for the Investigation of Special Circumstances. I would like to meet with Vladimir Semichastny to discuss-\"\n\n\"Special Circumstances?\" The woman interrupted, taking the cigarette out of her mouth as Kardashev blinked. \"Special Circumstances for what? What kind of Special Circumstances are we in, comrade?\" She asked, tone inquisitive- even as her facial expression refused to change."
 kurchatov.24.a: "\"...None, sorry. Thank you for your time.\""
 kurchatov.241.t: "The Letter"
 kurchatov.241.d: "The first thing on Nikolai Kardashev's mind when he found the note on his desk was that he recalled locking the door. In fact, he specifically remembered locking it before leaving- and yet, nothing was missing. Nothing had been overturned, or removed, or destroyed. All that was different was a single note on his desk with a badge- complete with a hexagonal sword-and-orbit emblem that he knew as connected to Special Circumstances, and he had recalled locking the door. That wasn't in here before he had left; had they broken in, deposited the note, and broken out? More importantly- the note.\n\n\"To People's Commissar Nikolai Kardashev.\"\n\n\"You have my support- and your persistence is an admirable quality. We will likely see each other in the future. Vladimir Semichastny.\"\n\nAny of the individuals outside of the office likely noted a small outburst of excitement, followed by a large sigh of relief."
 kurchatov.241.a: "Far better news than he expected."
 kurchatov.25.t: "An Utter Formality"
 kurchatov.25.d: "When the most pro-military of two candidates goes to a meeting of generals, he expects applause. Accolades. Cheers. All of these things are exactly what Vladmir Chelomei gets in spades- from Varennikov, while Oplesnin simply smiles politely. \"Gentlemen. You are several of the greatest military minds of our time- and beyond that. You already know what I am here to ask for. Need I continue?\"\n\nWith that, Chelomei falls silent with a smirk- and waits patiently. A passive observer to the rest of the meeting would have called the decision inevitable- which to an extent in Vladmir's eyes, it was. \"You have our support, of course. Only you can lead us into the future.\" Varennikov spoke, beaming as the others applauded. It was all easy- too easy. Yet, there was no opposition. No one raised their voice, or debated against him in the slightest, or did anything to question or deviate. It was almost eerie how in sync the entire thing was; but Chelomei put these thoughts aside. Of course they'd pick him. After all, he was their superior- and the clear choice."
 kurchatov.25.a: "No surprises here."
 kurchatov.26.t: "A Meeting of Somewhat Like Minds"
 kurchatov.26.d: "The moment Kardashev sat down across from Nikolai Oplesnin, he knew, from the hard look in the general's eyes, that he had his work cut out for him.\n\nHe needed to demonstrate support from the military in order to advance his claim on the Vice Premiership, and while he had been told Oplesnin was naturally sympathetic to his viewpoints on political and economic matters, the general was not going to give him his endorsement for free. That would come with a cost.\n\nAnd, so, Kardashev spoke at length about his plans for the military, should he be so endorsed. He spoke of a more efficient intelligence apparatus. About increasing the military's efficiency in all matters. About the absolute necessity for encouraging an apolitical nature within the armed forces, and thereby ensure state stability.\n\nOplesnin listened patiently, and Kardashev could tell that he, in general, quite liked what he heard. But, and most critically for any statement of support, he had not yet been told how much effort and political capital Kardashev was willing to spend to achieve the transformations promised.\n\nAnd that decision would make all the difference."
 kurchatov.26.a: "Promise him some effort."
 kurchatov.26.b: "Promise him more effort."
 kurchatov.26.c: "Promise him even more effort."
 kurchatov.27.t: "Somewhat Like Minds Converge"
 kurchatov.27.d: "Kardashev had not realized he had been holding his breath until the moment Oplesnin offered, in response to his entreaty, a slight nod. It was as if a weight had been removed from his chest.\n\nAs Oplesnin began to speak, some of that weight returned. But not nearly as much as he had feared, when first sitting down. The general was very clear that he supported Kardashev's goals for the military establishment, and that he was convinced that the promise would, at the very least, be fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.\n\nHe would not, however, openly support Kardashev's candidacy. As had been said, an apolitical military was a laudable and critical goal, and could not but be exemplified in the present. What he would do, however, was remain abjectly neutral in a personal sense. He would also work to ensure the rest of the General Staff behaved similarly.\n\nStanding and shaking hands, Kardashev turned to leave. It was not all he had wanted, but as the general had said, exemplifying - and thus proving - the belief of apoliticity was important. In addition and at the very least, though he was not receiving an endorsement from the military establishment, neither was Chelomei.\n\nAnd, Kardashev decided, that was good enough."
 kurchatov.27.a: "The best outcome reasonably possible."
 kurchatov.28.t: "Somewhat Like Minds Diverge"
 kurchatov.28.d: "Kardashev had not realized he had been holding his breath until the moment Oplesnin offered, in response to his entreaty, a shake of the head. It was as if the sudden weight that he felt on his chest had been increased tremendously.\n\nAs Oplesnin began to speak, it only continued to do so. The general was very clear that he was not convinced of Kardashev's drive to implement the promises made, and that, while he supported the ideas in general, he would not extend that support towards the candidacy for the Vice Premiership.\n\nAt least, and to Kardashev's extreme consternation, not to his own candidacy. Oplesnin made it clear that he, and the military in general, could not but support his rival. Chelomei was, after all, the People's Commissar for Defense as well as the military's superior, and all boons they had so far received had come through him. As well as an intelligent and committed man besides. To scorn that largesse would be a slight not forgotten, by anyone.\n\nStanding and shaking hands in a most perfunctory manner, Kardashev turned to leave. He had to fight to conceal his disappointment. It might have been naive of him to expect any other outcome, but he had all the same.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, his loss was Chelomei's gain."
 kurchatov.28.a: "A tactical defeat."
 kurchatov.29.t: "Chelomei and the Board"
 kurchatov.29.d: "Vladimir Chelomei cleared his throat as he approached the podium, smiling as he stood above the men of the Board for Intersolar Activities, his notes placed in front of him. \"Gentleman of the board, it is an honor to speak to you. As you know I have been looking into becoming the vice premier of the federation, and it would be in your best interest to endorse my candidacy in the Presidium.\"\n\n\"I believe the federation has not gone far enough to expand ultravisionary superculture into the stars, even going into defunding research into the fields of space exploration and conquest. I know as well that the acquirement of resources has been an issue, with less than enough to come close to the development of rocket technology. With the tide coming closer to an ultravisionary socialist united Russia, I assure you that your needs will be met! Russia will enter into the stars and soviet weaponry and technology will spread throughout the galaxy. Kardashev will only ignore the greatness we can achieve with the militarization of space, but I promise that I will not ignore this tenet of ultravisionism, and this board will get what it needs to conquer the stars!\"\n\nWith the conclusion of his speech, Chelomei expected a standing ovation. All he got was a cough. A balding man stood up out of his seat, obviously the chairman. \"Comrade Chelomei, we are thankful for your support, but we need more... specific promises. We have long dealt with vague assurances of funding year after year, yet we receive nothing when the time comes. What will you ensure the Board will receive?\"\n\n\"Chelomei paused, knowing he needed the support of the board, but what to promise them? Promising them too much would be costly for the future, but not enough would surely offer him little support. He stood quietly for a moment, then blurted-\""
 kurchatov.29.a: "\"Enough funding for a new satellite program!\""
 kurchatov.29.b: "\"Whatever it takes to get us to the moon and back!\""
 kurchatov.29.c: "\"Everything the federation has to ensure an Ultravisionary Socialist galaxy!\""
 kurchatov.30.t: "A Standing Ovation"
 kurchatov.30.d: "Chelomei waited for a reaction from the board, nervously anticipating what they would decide. However, his fears were quickly abated as each member stood up one by one, and gave a standing ovation, some even cheering. \"Now that's what we like to hear!\" Said the chairman, clapping alongside the others. \"Comrade Chelomei, you have your endorsement!\"\n\nChelomei smiled and stepped off the podium as the board began to formally vote to endorse him, looking as if it was unanimous. He had done it, and the Board for Intersolar Activities was a very important ally as well. He just hoped he hadn't promised too much, but he wouldn't have to worry about that yet.\n\nGrabbing a glass of water, one of the board members patted him on the back, saying, \"I just wanted to thank you personally, Comrade Chelomei. It seems you higher-ups have finally shown they truly care about socialist space exploration. I do hope you uphold your promise if you are elected.\"\n\nChelomei glanced down, then back at the board member. \"You will not have to worry about that, I always uphold my promises, no matter what they are.\"\n\nThe board member grabbed a glass of water. \"We shall see, Comrade, we shall see.\""
 kurchatov.30.a: "Take that, Kardashev!"
 kurchatov.31.t: "The Board's Agreement"
 kurchatov.31.d: "Chelomei's words seemed to hang in the air, the tension in the room suffocating. The chairman remained silent for a moment, then began whispering to some of the other members of the board. Collectively they all stood up, and the chairman broke the silence. \"I'm sorry, Comrade Chelomei, while we are thankful for your assurance, we have all decided we cannot endorse you based on your speech alone. We were selected to be a part of this board to not worry about political matters, and it is better off if we do not intervene in the Presidium's decision. We hope you understand.\"\n\nChelomei sighed, all that effort for nothing. \"Thank you for inviting me anyway, gentlemen, comrades. I promise you I will not fail to give you what you want, and I hope that you may reconsider someday. Until then, do you have any vodka?\""
 kurchatov.31.a: "It was worth a try."
 kurchatov.32.t: "Making Friends with the Board"
 kurchatov.32.d: "Kardeshev stood above the men of the Board for Intersolar Activities, his podium overlooking the entire room. \"Comrades of the Board, thank you for inviting me. As you know, my goal to become the next Vice Premier is still ongoing, and I need as much support in the Presidium as I can get, which you can provide. Now, my proposals for a better space program are much different than some others of the Presidium. I know many who have promised the militarization of space and millions of other things, many unachievable. Instead of a militarized space program, I propose a more peaceful one.\"\n\n\"One where we explore the stars, not out to conquer in the name of socialism, but to learn, and to improve our own self. To be honest, it will be a challenge, but one we can overcome and not impossible.\"\n\nKardeshev paused, seeing what the responses from the board were and continued, \"I also propose a peaceful answer to ensure we gain resources from our stars, space industrialization. Instead of militarizing space, we must use it to our advantage! Unending resources in our hands only, our supremacy of technology bringing us forward! Without competition from the imperialists, we will rise!\"\n\nEnding his speech, Kardeshev anticipated the board's reaction. The chairman was beginning to look interested. \"I like where your ideas are coming from, comrade Kardeshev, but the industrialization of space sounds like a difficult task. What can you promise to make it worth all the effort that must be put into it?\""
 kurchatov.32.a: "\"The funding you need to get the research started.\""
 kurchatov.32.b: "\"Grants and an expansion of the program to ensure space is a priority!\""
 kurchatov.32.c: "\"Full funding, for an industrialized solar system!\""
 kurchatov.33.t: "The Board Endorses!"
 kurchatov.33.d: "Ending with his promise, Kardashev saw the chairman smile. \"That sounds perfect, Comrade Kardashev,\" The chairman said as the rest of the board began to clap. \"Your speech has been very persuasive, I believe you have your endorsement.\"\n\n\"Thank you, and I promise I will do all I can as your Vice Premier.\" On that note, Kurchatov stepped off the podium as the board began their official vote to extend their endorsement to him, looking as if it were unanimous. Grabbing a glass of water, Kardashev reflected to himself. Would he be able to get the board what they wanted? The Federation already short on funds after years of war and development, and it would only get worse. But then again, Zhdanov had always been confident during the speeches he had given. As his Vice Premier, he would make sure the federation achieved what every person in Russia dreamed of, no matter the cost.\n\nA true socialist civilization was coming, and it wouldn't stop until it hit the very edges of the galaxy."
 kurchatov.33.a: "Another step to the Vice Premiership."
 kurchatov.34.t: "The Board's Decision"
 kurchatov.34.d: "The Board's reception was muted, and a conversation began in hushed tones. Soon, it seemed the board had come to a conclusion. \"I'm sorry, Comrade Kardashev, while your promise does sound enticing, the industrialization of space still sounds like a daunting task. We have also collectively decided we cannot endorse any candidate, as we do not want to involve ourselves in political matters.\"\n\nKardashev's eyes lowered to the ground. \"I understand your decision, but I do hope you know that I will uphold my promise if I do become Vice Premier. I want nothing more than to see our federation exploring the stars, but I know you are the ones who will do it. It has been a pleasure.\"\n\nAnd with that, Kardashev stepped off the podium, grabbed a plate of food, and left."
 kurchatov.34.a: "Unfortunate."
 kurchatov.35.t: "Commitments"
 kurchatov.35.d: "People's Commissar of Industry Alexander Sheremetyev sat calmly at his desk, looking over reports and various other paperwork. More and more money and labor was going towards basic amenities as civilian production slowed down and was shifted more and more towards the government's back. Chelomei had promised a solution and was set to meet him today, and so Alexander had been sitting at his desk waiting for the clock to strike three for the past hour.\n\nFinally, he heard three rapid knocks at his office door.\n\n\"Come in.\" Said Sheremetyev, straightening out the papers scattered across his desk and fixing his posture. The door swung open and in came Chelomei, with his own neat stack of papers clasped against his chest.\n\n\"Comrade Sheremetyev, good to see you.\" Began Chelomei. Sheremetyev simply nodded in response before looking up.\n\n\"Good to see you aswell. I don't have a lot of time so lets get down to business. What is it you wanted to talk to me about today?\"\n\n\"I've noticed that there has been more and more strain on your Commissariat as our territory grows and people expect more amenities. I have a solution that would make both our jobs easier, but I can't put it into practice until I'm chosen as Vice Premier. Can I count on your support?\"\n\nCautious but intrigued, Sheremetyev replied, \"Well, what is it? I can't decide unless you give me something to work off of.\"\n\nWith a thump, Chelomei dropped the entire stack of papers onto the table. Sheremetyev peered onto the first page, reading the title of the dossier: \"Visionary Social Commitments.\"\n\n\"Exactly what it says in bold. We will shift some of the burden of our industry to citizens through social engineering and other means. I've done the math and projections, all I need is someone to read it - and your support.\""
 kurchatov.35.a: "\"This program should decrease consumption by point five percent yearly...\""
 kurchatov.35.b: "\"This program should allow for significant increases in the efficiency of our civilian sector...\""
 kurchatov.35.c: "\"This program should allow for a comprehensive reshuffling of our industrial might!\""
 kurchatov.36.t: "Vanquished Daydreams"
 kurchatov.36.d: "Chelomei was startled out of his stuporous daydreaming at his desk by the ringing of his phone. Sighing, he sat up and blinked a few times to banish his grogginess before picking up the phone. He had been expecting a call from Sheremetyev, but he had assumed that, with Sheremetyev's busy schedule, he would not be calling until this evening. But, nonetheless, there was Alexander's voice on the other end.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Comrade. I've just finished reading your proposal. Quite creative I must say...\"\n\n\"Well that's good news. What did you think of it, then?\"\n\n\"At first I was skeptical, I admit - I'm so used to working with machines, I'm not too well versed in sociology or anything like that. But, the numbers seem right and the concept is well thought out. If this were put into action, well, I'd have to mock up a proper projection to get a real number, but efficiency would almost certainly improve.\"\n\n\"So, I can count on your support, then?\"\n\n\"Of course, comrade. You proved yourself both honest and efficient. Have a wonderful day.\" Finished Sheremetyev before hanging up. Chelomei placed his own telephone down and turned back to his desk. Smiling to himself, he leaned back in his seat and slipped back into a daydream."
 kurchatov.36.a: "One rung higher."
 kurchatov.37.t: "Broken Daydreams"
 kurchatov.37.d: "Chelomei was startled out of his stuporous daydreaming at his desk by the ringing of his phone. Sighing, he sat up and blinked a few times to banish his grogginess before picking up the phone. He had been expecting a call from Sheremetyev, but he had assumed that, with Sheremetyev's busy schedule, he would not be calling until this evening. But, nonetheless, there was Alexander's voice on the other end.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Comrade. Allow me to just say - what the hell, Vladimir? What's your game?\"\n\nStartled and confused, Chelomei sputtered a reply, \"Wh-what do you mean, Comrade?\"\n\n\"Your proposal is bullshit. I read it and felt a little suspicious of your numbers so I had some of my own analysts go over it and you know what they said? 'His proposal is bullshit'.\"\n\nAfter taking a deep breath, and silently cursing himself, Chemolei sighed. \"I suppose this means I can't count on your support in my pursuit of Vice Premier, then?\"\n\n\"Sounds about right, comrade. Next time you're looking for support, either be more honest or find someone as dishonest as yourself.\" Sheremetyev hung up, and Chemolei sat at his desk staring out his window in shock.\n\n\"Bastard.\" Muttered Chemolei, before he went looking for another sponsor in his address book, irritated but not put off."
 kurchatov.37.a: "A mild setback."
 kurchatov.38.t: "Stacking Paper"
 kurchatov.38.d: "Kardashev halted at the door to the office of Alexander Sheremetyev, People's Commissar of Industry. According to his watch, he had arrived five minutes before he was meant to, having called ahead to tell the Commissar that he would be coming by at 4:00 PM. Shrugging, although a little worried that his lack of punctuality would cause him to catch the Commissar off guard, he knocked on the door.\n\nSheremetyev's voice could be heard through the wood, beckoning Kardashev to come in. Entering the office, Kardashev saw the Commissar sitting amid a mound of paperwork stacked on his desk. The two men greeted eachother, friendly but curt, before Kardashev got right down to business.\n\n\"I know you must be busy, but I've had some ideas I think you might want to look into.\"\n\n\"Ideas, you say?\" Replied Sheremetyev.\n\n\"Yes. I've been doing some research, and some thinking, and I think I have an idea of how we could vastly increase productivity here in the industry sector... provided I make Vice Premier.\"\n\n\"Really, now?\" Sheremetyev, cautious but interested. \"Could you explain some of it to me?\"\n\n\"Sure! And here, I've written some projections down as well.\" Kardashev added, placing down yet another stack of papers. Kardashev then sat down, going through his plans, ideas and promises while the Commissar frantically took notes. When all was said and done, Kardashev stood up. \"Thank you for meeting with me today. I hope I can count on your support for my efforts towards becoming Vice Premier.\"\n\n\"I'll have to look over your work, but... I'm sure it will check out.\""
 kurchatov.38.a: "The projections evision a consistent increase in electrical availability per year."
 kurchatov.38.b: "The projections present an image of a system that would be able to utilize much more energy in practical processes."
 kurchatov.38.c: "The projections rely upon the widespread implementation of theoretical nuclear fusion technology."
 kurchatov.39.t: "Promises Kept"
 kurchatov.39.d: "The evening was quiet and cold, the wind howling through the trees outside Kardashev's home. He had just finished proofreading yet another research paper he had been laboring over for a few days when he heard his phone ringing. Sauntering across the house to the kitchen, Kardashev picked up the phone. On the other end was the now familiar voice of Sheremetyev.\n\n\"Good evening, Comrade.\" Spoke Sheremetyev.\n\n\"Evening.\" Kardashev nodded, before realizing the gesture was pointless on a phone call.\n\n\"I looked over your notes, and the ones I took during our conversation, with a few of my analysts. I admit, at first I was skeptical with how far reaching and optimistic your ideas were, but they seem both achievable and efficient. With you in the position of Vice Premier, I'm positive we could make a change for the better in this country's industry.\"\n\n\"That's great news! Thank you, Comrade.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. Honesty is something that I appreciate, and you proved to me that you can reach for the stars and goddamn deliver. I look forward to your reign as Vice Premier, if you make it there. Good night.\""

On the other end was the now familiar voice of Sheremetyev.\n\n\"Good evening, Comrade.\" Spoke Sheremetyev, bitterness dripping from every word.\n\n\"Evening.\" Kardashev nodded, before realizing the gesture was pointless on a phone call.\n\n\"I should've trusted my gut, Nikolai. Your ideas seemed ludicrous, but I thought 'Nikolai's a smart guy, he can pull through with stuff like this'. Turns out they really were, though.\"\n\n\"Wh-what do you mean? I checked everything.\" Kardashev was shocked, and was already reddenning in embarrassment.\n\n\"Apparently not enough. The numbers are all wrong, made-up technologies are implemented - and things like safety precautions and costs are completely left out at some points. It's just all too much of a reach, Nikolai. You're always looking so far ahead without even thinking about how your plans might end up. I want a Vice Premier who is capable of honesty about the feasibility of his goals. Your papers tell of a man who doesn't quite know how to get where he's going. I'm sorry.\" Kardashev's phone clicked as Sheremetyev hung up his own. Now completely red with embarrassment, and quite frankly stinging from the brutal deconstruction of his methods and work, he sighed and returned to his study.\n\nIn his study, his newly finished research paper was waiting for him.

Knocking on the window, Chelomei opened the door to see the bored-looking men and women turn their attention to him. \"Comrade Chelomei, how unexpected,\" said a man standing in front of a presentation, obviously the manager. \"We're in the middle of quite an important meeting on unemployment in the federation, and-\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure you'll have enough time for that later,\" Chelomei replied. \"I just wanted to stop by and speak to you for a few minutes about some new ideas I had to improve things around here.\"\n\n\"Oh, well...\" The manager turned his eyes to the rest of the room, obviously looking quite interested in Chelomei's presence, eager to about something different other than their mundane task. \"Alright, you can speak, but only for a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Chelomei, taking the manager's place in front of the board. \"You may be wondering what I'm doing here, at a place known for only records-keeping and census-taking. I'm sure you have heard already I am looking forwards to becoming the next Vice Premier, and it is now my responsibility to gain support from all around the government, you included. Which is why I decided to come up with a new innovation that will change your jobs forever. I call it Visionary Management Techniques, and it will rebuild this entire bureau! New methods of administration and bureaucracy, all to make your jobs easier!\"\n\n\"With what though?\" A tweedy man in the back interrupted. \"We've done everything we can to make things easier, that's part of our job. There's nothing left to improve pen and paper.\"\n\n\"Ah, but that's the thing,\" said Chelomei. \"We will do away with the nonvisionary pen and paper, via computerization! Machines will lead bureaucracy into a new age of wonder, and I assure you your jobs will be made twice as easier!\"\n\nThe manager approached the front of the room, saying, \"This all sounds amazing, Comrade Chelomei, but what is the timeframe we are looking at to have our Commissariat modernized?\""

Sighing, Chelomei went to check his mail one last time, hoping for any sort of response from the commissariat.\n\nWhat was once an empty mailbox, however, now held a small note addressed to him. Opening it up, it was exactly what he had hoped for, from the rather reclusive Alexey Poskonov no less.\n\nThe People's Commissar had written a short letter, and reading it to himself, Chelomei knew he had promised the right things. \nComrade Chelomei - it began - I am impressed with what I have heard from some of the others in my bureau, and I'm even disappointed I could not hear it myself. Your ideas to improve the commissariat are like no other, and you can count on my support in the Presidium. I will be pleased to see you as our next Vice Premier.\n\nCommisar Alexey Poskonov"

 kurchatov.44.d: "Kardashev knocked on the wooden door and peeked through the large window into the meeting inside. A look of annoyance came from the manager which was quickly replaced when he realized who was at the door. \"Comrade Kardashev, what a surprise!\" He exclaimed as he opened the door and invited him in. \"What brings you to the People's Commissariat of Central Records?\"\n\n\"I was interested in asking you what you might think of a few plans I came up with to improve things in your bureau,\" replied Kardashev, taking a place at the front of the room. \"I have been working on how I would go on to improve every part of the Federation, your Commissariat among them. Care to give me a few moments of your time?\"\n\n\"Well, we were in the middle of an important meeting-\"\n\n\"Perfect, it will only be a few minutes!\" Interrupted Kardashev as he motioned for the manager to sit down. \"Now, how would you feel if I told you that everyone in this room would have their jobs revolutionized if I were to win the vote in the Presidium. I have discovered a new way to transform government administration, called cybernetic management. Cybernetic management is the way of the future, and it is closer than you may think. Without much in complex technology or the dependence on computers, an important bureau such as yours could be twice as productive. With cybernetic management, a full reorganization of the management and work process could create peak administrative efficiency. I also propose more automation in the workplace, giving computers more menial tasks and making sure everyone knows their job. With computers taking the less desirable work, the worker can be managed like a well-oiled machine.\""

 kurchatov.45.d: "It had been days since Kardashev had walked the halls and talked with the bureaucrats in the People's Commissariat of Central Records. The committee had liked his ideas, calling them revolutionary and transformative, yet he had not gotten any confirmation that he would have their support in the Presidium. Kardashev leaned back in his chair with a look of disappointment on his face, sure he had failed.\n\nSuddenly, one of his aides walked in the room. \"Commissar Kardashev, you have a letter from Commisar Poskonov.\" Taking the letter inquisitively, he was surprised it was from the rather reclusive Poskonov.\n\nHe had written a short letter, and reading it to himself, Kardashev smiled. He would have the support of the Commisar of Central Records, and his plans were approved."
 kurchatov.45.a: "Perfect."
 kurchatov.46.t: "No Reply"
 kurchatov.46.d: "It had been a while since Kardashev had been to the People's Commissariat of Central Records, and still he had not heard a single word since.

It looked like he was going to have to try somewhere else, and hopefully, Chelomei wouldn't get there first."

 kurchatov.47.d: "The Presidium vote was imminent, and soon the next Vice-Premier would be chosen. It would be a close vote. Too close. Neither Kardashev nor Chelomei had a majority, and the vote would likely be a deadlock. Kardashev didn't want to destabilize the Federation's succession just for the sake of power, and he hoped Chelomei agreed.\n\nAll of the members of the Presidium had chosen their sides, and try as he might, Kardashev couldn't get any others to budge. Kardashev had expended all of his other options, leaving only one decision left.\n\nKardashev sighed. He didn't want to do this, but his hands were tied. He picked up the phone and began dialing the People's Commissariat of Defense. The phone rang a few times, and then he heard a stern voice come through, \"Comrade Kardashev. Come to withdraw your candidacy?\"\n\nKardashev held his tongue, and after his head had cooled, responded, \"No, Comrade Chelomei, I've come to make a deal.\""
 kurchatov.47.a: "\"I would have preferred the resignation.\""
 kurchatov.48.t: "Out of Options"
 kurchatov.48.d: "The Presidium vote was imminent, and soon the next Vice-Premier would be chosen. It would be a close vote. Too close. Neither Kardashev nor Chelomei had a majority, and the vote was likely going to be a deadlock. If the current situation continued, the succession's legitimacy would be thrown into question. As much as Chelomei disliked him, even Kardashev wouldn't be so foolish to allow that to happen.\n\nNone of the other voters would budge, no matter how much Chelomei bargained with them. Every other option had been expanded, and Chelomei had been forced into an unenviable position. He had to work with Kardashev.\n\nAfter ten minutes attempting to find the right words, Chelomei sighed. He really didn't want to do this. Yet he picked up the phone anyway, and called the People's Commissariat of Energy. Soon, Chelomei heard Kardashev's voice on the other end, \"Comrade Chelomei. What a surprise. I presume this is about the vote?\"\n\n\"Yes, comrade, I'm calling to make a deal.\""
 kurchatov.48.a: "\"...You've piqued my interest.\""
 kurchatov.49.t: "Meeting with Chelomei"
 kurchatov.49.d: "The atmosphere in Chelomei's office was tense. The two men sat across from each other, and neither were particularly happy. However, a compromise had to be reached, and so Kardashev broke the silence, \"Let's face the facts here. I have more votes than you, but not enough to guarantee my victory. I should be Vice Premier.\"\n\n\"I would only accept such a thing under certain conditions.\"\n\n\"I expected as much.... Fine, what are your terms?\"\n\n\"My demands are simple. First, when you become Vice-Premier, I want my seat on the Presidium guaranteed.\"\n\n\"That's fine, what else?\"\n\n\"My other demand is that I'll be able to pick your replacement as People's Commissar of Energy.\"\n\n\"That's quite the demand! Why-\"\n\n\"Do you want my support or not?\"\n\nKardashev didn't want to give up the People's Commissariat of Energy to one of Chelomei's goons, but Chelomei had the upper hand. Kardashev had to give in, \"Fine. I'll accept those demands, but that's as far as I'll go.\""

Shelves of scientific literature filled his bookshelves, graphs and Ultravisionary art were pasted across every wall, and a large blackboard sat behind Kardashev. Chelomei was fixing his eyes on anything in order to distract from looking at Kardashev's smug face. He knew that Chelomei's deal was a perfect opportunity for him, and Chelomei dreaded whatever he had to say. Chelomei looked Kardashev in the eye, and spoke, \"I have more votes secured, but not a majority. For the sake of the Federation, I am willing to compromise with you if you'll withdraw your candidacy. What are your terms?\"\n\n\"Well, if you're going to become Vice-Premier, I want my seat in the Presidium guaranteed.\"\n\n\"Fine. What else?\"\n\n\"I would like to nominate your replacement as People's Commissar of Defense.\"\n\n\"Wha- that's absurd! Why should I throw away-\"\n\n\"Sounds like you won't have my support. Shame.\"\n\nChelomei felt his blood boil, and he almost walked out of this cramped, over-decorated office right then and there. However, for the sake of the Federation, Chelomei had to agree, \"...I accept your term.\"\n\nBefore Kardashev could respond, Chelomei stood up and left, slamming the door behind him."

Tensions were high as each vote was counted, and the entire Presidium sat silently as Zhdanov announced the results.\n\n\"The next Vice Premier of the United Soviet Federation is Nikolay Kardashev!\"\n\nThe Presidium applauded Kardashev as he walked up to the podium to stand next to the Paramount Leader. Kardashev had won by a fair margin, and Chelomei had no room to contest the vote. It seemed that the future of the United Soviet Federation would follow Kardashev's vision.\n\nAs the applause began to die down, and with Kardashev standing behind him, Zhdanov continued to speak, stating that the next People's Commissar of Energy would be selected in a future meeting. Then, Kardashev was given a chance to give a speech. He thanked the Presidium and the Paramount Leader, and vowed that he would not fail the United Soviet Federation.\n\nAnother round of applause followed, and after the applause died down, the meeting was adjourned, and Kardashev finally had a quiet moment to reflect upon his victory."

Comrades, I now present to you: Vice-Premier Vladimir Chelomei.\"\n\nChelomei gave a speech thanking the Presidium for electing him as Vice-Premier, and detailing his plans moving forward. He finished his speech by nominating Valentin Glushko as People's Commissar of Defense. While not the most popular man, and in fact often criticized for his stubbornness by his coworkers, he was very loyal to Chelomei's vision. He would undoubtedly continue Chelomei's projects and policies as People's Commissar of Defense. Following Chelomei's speech, the Presidium was adjourned."

He also, as the meeting came to a close, proposed the final decision of the night - the elevation, to Kardashev's now vacant position of People's Commissar of Energy, of a rising star within the state's nuclear directorate.\n\nThe decision, in the affirmative, was quick.

Rest assured, I'll be doing my best to bring the USF to new heights- and I have plenty of ideas for how we can continue to progress forward.\" Silence for a few moments, as Andrei Zhdanov looked at him- and for once, the man's age hit Chelomei like a freight train. The Paramount Leader was dying. Andrei was dying. Someday, Chelomei would be the new Paramount Leader. Someday, Vladimir Chelomei would be alone.\n\nAnd for a moment, as he looked at the haggard old eyes of the Paramount Leader, a single pang of sorrow eclipsed it. His dreams. His aspirations. Everything. Even with all the advances they were looking into, all things died. And that included the Paramount Leader himself. Nothing could change that, and nothing would change the fact that Andrei Zhdanov would one day be in a casket, with Chelomei at his funeral. Perhaps he'd say kind words, or sorrowful ones.

The chatter of doctors, nurses, and patients. The clopping of shoes against tile. The hum of air conditioning and fluorescent lights.\n\nKardashev and the nurse reached the end of the hall where a rather unassuming door waited to be opened. Opening the door, the nurse gestured for Kardashev to enter. The white noise was still deafening as the physicist stepped carefully into the room, his eyes quickly drawn to the edge where Zhdanov lay in the bed under clean white sheets. Hooked up to all kinds of machinery Kardashev couldn't name, much less divine the use of, Zhdanov gestured with an IV-punctured arm for Nikolai to step closer.\n\n\"I'm dying. You know it. I know it.

So much responsibility to be thrust on him so quickly; Could he guide the nation as well as Zhdanov had? Would he be remembered as a failure?\n\n\"I'll have... someone send you the paperwork and all that.\" Continued Zhdanov.

He pledged to do so.\n\nThe applause was, of course, unanimous. It was also, Kardashev could tell, perfunctory. He would have to work hard to secure support from many who did not trust him, and who clearly thought, judging by the glances thrown towards the man, that Chelomei should have been standing in his spot.\n\nBut as Paramount Leader Kardashev stepped down from the platform, he knew that he could.

So far, he had coped with the shift through focusing on other things.\n\nThings such as the workmen carefully and respectfully packaging Zhdanov's personal effects, for distribution to family or state museums as indicated by his will and final wishes. It would not be long before he had to move his own effects in to replace them. There was much more space to fill. Physically and metaphorically.\n\nTurning his mind to the future, Kardashev swiveled the chair and looked out the enormous windows. He was the Federation's steward now, and he knew there would have to be change. Many of the Federation's programs were simply unsustainable, and though he had no idea how to begin unravelling the dense network of unnecessary commissions and project boards that were so prevalent, he was keenly aware of the need to figure it out.

Zhdanov was a figure who had always been larger than life, dominating every room he was in, and now he looked sick. Weak. Old, for the first time ever.\n\nWorse, he could barely speak. Could barely leverage the talent that, along with a visionary mind had been, more than anything else, responsible for the Federation even existing in the first place. But he had struggled through, and though his words were halting, Zhdanov spoke to Chelomei. Told him that he knew he was going to die. Told him that he had to keep the vision moving forward.\n\nChelomei had been quick to pledge to do so. To pledge to see his leader's vision through to its conclusion. It was what he knew Zhdanov wanted to hear, of course, but it was also his firm belief. He had been an orthodox Ultravisionary for many years, and he had no intention of deviating now, in the moments of greatest peril for the agenda as a whole.\n\nAnd though uncertain for the future, shaken and struggling as he still was, Chelomei knew he would fight to ensure that the promise he had made was properly kept."

 chelomei.3.d: "Vladimir Chelomei sat in the chair he had spent years standing in front of. The Paramount Leader's chair. Zhdanov's chair. His chair.\n\nHe was still, in truth, processing the change. Ever since his elevation to Vice-Premier he had of course known it was coming, especially with Zhdanov's declining health, but knowing and experiencing were, as many had told him, very different things. So far, he had coped with the shift through focusing on other things.\n\nThings such as the workmen carefully and respectfully packaging Zhdanov's personal effects, for distribution to family or state museums as indicated by his will and final wishes. It would not be long before he had to move his own effects in to replace them. There was much more space to fill. Physically and metaphorically.\n\nTurning his mind to the future, Chelomei swiveled the chair and looked out the enormous windows. He was the Federation's steward now, trusted with ensuring that the Ultravisionary agenda continued along orthodox lines. There were so many more programs to sponsor. So many more frontiers to explore.\n\nAnd it was time to get to work."

 KOM_lcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_soviets: "From Disorder, Liberation"
 KOM_lcoup_the_peoples_revolution_desc: "The Komi Communist Party has long since decried the Republic for being a bourgeois-democratic institution - a state that spat on the grave of the old Union, and brought rise to capitalism and decadence in Syktyvkar.\n\nHowever, the days of this have come to an end, with the seizure of power by the Communist Party. Already, the previous National Assembly has been arrested and imprisoned, with only those determined to be loyal allowed to take their seats. The era of bourgeois democracy is over in Syktyvkar, it seems - at least, if the Communist Party's Presidium has anything to say about it."
 KOM_lcoup_appeal_for_a_united_party_desc: "The Left, in general, has accumulated a reputation for internal factionalism and bickering within its institutions. However, this is not the time for infighting. To consolidate the influence of the Revolution in Komi, we must cast aside the particularities of our ideological interpretations for now, and focus on effective and constructive governance.\n\nThe Presidium, spearheaded by General Secretary Suslov, will pass a decree immediately, banning factionalism and suspending political activity outside sanctioned events, until the duration of our current crisis is over."
 KOM_lcoup_repurpose_the_systems_desc: "Now is not the time for idealism. The bureaucracy of the old Republic was crucial for keeping its basic functions online - the essential organs of the state continue to exist under our management, maintaining a sort of bitter standoff with the new ruling party. To ensure that we are capable of governing at all, during and even after the Revolution, addressing the remaining government bureaucrats and reassuring them of our benevolent intentions is a course of action we must follow."
 KOM_lcoup_on_suslovs_orders_desc: "Whilst the Republic may be collectively ruled at the moment, we must remember that this is a fragile state of affairs, susceptible to personalist corruption. Mikhail Suslov, General Secretary of the Communist Party, can be trusted to maintain the essential democratic functions of the Communist Party. An internally democratic system is sufficient for now - due to the unrest outside, we must hold the Party above the internecine bickering that fills the Republic at this time. The Party may seek to represent the people - but for now, it must remain aloof."
 KOM_lcoup_lock_down_syktyvkar_desc: "The Revolution against the previous government caught many by surprise, and cast Syktyvkar into a state of absolute chaos, as well as destabilizing other urban centers throughout the Republic. While the capital itself is solidly under our control, we must recognize that the outlying rural areas could very well be hosting remnant Republican Army units, and reactionary partisans. Thusly, the Presidium of the Communist Party of Komi shall pass a decree limiting travel in and out of Syktyvkar, until the current crisis has elapsed."
 KOM_lcoup_mobilize_suslovs_men_desc: "Whilst certain socialist heroes and patriots within the old Republican Army have collaborated with our new government, and furnished us with weapons, armored vehicles, and manpower, this is not the entirety of the resources that we are capable of mobilizing. Before the Revolution, General Secretary Suslov oversaw the creation of numerous socialist paramilitary units and partisans, tasked with working alongside the Party to secure true proletarian rule over the Republic. Now that our control has been established, we can officially commission this reserve into a reorganized Komi Red Army, and establish a truly reliable armed forces."
 KOM_lcoup_paralyze_the_army_desc: "The Komi Republican Army, with the exception of the units and officers that sided with us, is something that one could truly call an inherently reactionary organization. With our establishment of a parallel Red Army to replace the Komi Republican Army, the time has come to officially dissolve the reactionary institutions of the previous armed forces. Generals will be imprisoned, fascist infiltrators will be smoked out, and equipment will be repurposed for more constructive causes. The effect on our army shall be significant, but it shall be temporary, and it shall be worth it."
 KOM_lcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_soviets_desc: "The Revolution has succeeded! From every building in Syktyvkar, the red flag waves, and in our other cities, proud parades march down main boulevards that were until a mere month ago, dens of the bourgeois. The old Republic has finally come to an end - the capitalist transitionary phase has been snuffed out by the proletarian revolution, and our new socialist republic has been birthed from its ashes.\n\nThe time is nigh for the end of our inward focus, and the beginning of our rightful reclamation of the Soviet Union. The Russian people, and soon the peoples of the world, shall welcome us as liberators!"
 KOM_lcoup_promise_true_freedom_desc: "Freedom cannot be found in bourgeoisie democracy; there, you are chained by those whose wealth funnels to the top, that decide a man's future not fully of his own free will. Freedom cannot be found in fascism; there, you are tied to the identity of the state, a monolithic, faceless entity that only wishes to subsume the identity of those who fall prey to its inhuman tactics.\n\nOnly in socialism may freedom be found! To vote, to think, to speak, to walk freely, to step forward and shatter the notion that this is the end of history!"
 KOM_lcoup_peoples_political_struggle_desc: "Despite the formation of our pre-existing professional reserve Red Army, there exist many people throughout the Republic who may seek to take up arms in this time of crisis. We cannot afford to limit participation in our forces to those that were trained and prepared beforehand - in this time of crisis, the populace itself must take up arms alongside our pre-trained soldiers, and stand fast against the tide of reaction.\n\nThe Red Army, made up of Suslov's professional paramilitaries and partisans trained in the years leading up to our Revolution, shall be supplemented with a tide of enthusiastic proletarians. Let them be taught in the school of action!"
 KOM_lcoup_silence_the_unswayed_desc: "There are those who remain who do not share the same vision as us. No, to go a step further, they seek to ruin, torment and corrupt our vision into something else. We will not allow ourselves to be destroyed by reactionary elements. Many times has this happened in history, but it will not happen here. These voices who wish to bring Komi to ruin will be brought down.\n\nAnd such dissent will be silenced forever."
 KOM_lcoup_the_legitimate_option_desc: "Just shy of 20 years ago, the Soviet Union was beaten by the Nazi menace. However, this did not mean the end of communism in Russia, as the WRRF maintained control over west Russia until the end of the West Russian War. Despite what some on the right may say, it has only been a few years that Komi has not been under a truly revolutionary banner. Considering all of this, it is a truth that a Komi under communism is the only Komi with any legitimacy, and the only Komi with legitimacy is one that is truly backed by the workers.\n\nWe shall turn our eyes to the Soviets through which our laborers still organize within, and entrust these councils with the keys to power once more."
 KOM_lcoup_propaganda_blackout_desc: "All across the radio waves and streets of Komi, propaganda blares. A solid chunk of it is our propaganda, but the rest of the propaganda comes from the desperate attempts of the center and the right to win the people over to their side. Under no circumstance can we allow this to happen. In order to counteract these propaganda campaigns, we must blot it out in any way possible. On the streets, we shall inspire the devotees to tear down the reactionary posters, showing that we will fight them on every front possible. While we rally against the posters and other such physical propaganda, we will also utilize what technology we have to find and eliminate the radio stations that the reactionaries blare their propaganda from. With luck, we can end any and all threats to the revolution!"
 KOM_lcoup_we_are_benevolent_desc: "It would be silly to think that only those in the high castle can make decisions. Who are we to say that we must shut ourselves off and decide what the people want? Komi is not a palace of nobles! We must encourage the citizens that it is their word that decides the future of this country.\n\nThose more politically-engaged will be encouraged to join local organizations dedicated to debating the ideas of socialism, while others will be recruited into government offices - the old, the young, the men and the women, all will lead Komi forward!"
 KOM_lcoup_out_of_harms_way_desc: "All of Komi is awash in violence. As it will likely take time for the violence to die down, we must devote efforts to protecting the people. We may justify it with a need for political support, but in the end, many of the people of Komi are innocent civilians who merely wish to live in happiness. To allow them to be gunned down, even for a just cause, is disgusting. They did not ask for chaos to envelop their lives, so why should they face the consequences of others actions? It may cost resources to protect civilians, but it is a cost worth taking, as after all, if we fail to protect those who we represent, are we truly their savior?"

 KOM_zhdanov_enough_of_this_nonsense_desc: "リバタリアニズムはコミのみならずロシア全土に蔓延する問題に対処するに値しないことが既に示されている。自由は無秩序とイコールではない。党は満場一致で方針の転換を決定した。もちろん、ここでの「方針転換」は「政府の転換」を意味する。\n\n我々は「革命的布告」を利用し、コミを政治家ではなく国家の繁栄を第一目標に据える国家へと作り替える。ロシア万歳！ソビエト連邦万歳！超先見的社会主義万歳！同志ジダーノフ、万歳！"
 KOM_zhdanov_the_social_sphere_desc: "権力の維持を目論むならば、人民を味方につけねばならない。革命的布告によって我々は腐敗した政治家から権力を奪取したが、人民に対して苦杯を舐めさせるような施策も多くとってしまった。今、その施策を守るかどうか決断せねばならない。\n\n一方では、我々にそのような責務はないと解釈できる。我々は権力を握っており、自由に、他者の介入なしにコミの人民のための最良の決断を下すことができるからだ。他方で、そのような決断を行なった場合の結末は予想がつく。そのため、我々は熟慮する必要があるのだ……"
 KOM_zhdanov_repeal_the_revolutionary_decrees_desc: "革命的布告は目的への道筋に他ならない。政府内での権力掌握のために人民を抑制する必要があったが、その目的はすでに達成された。そのためその撤回になんら問題は生じない。政府は国家の善のために、その施策を撤回する権利を持っているのだ！\n\n人民からの抗議、それも大規模なものが起こりうるだろう。だが、ジダーノフはそれを次第に鎮静化すると信じている。なぜなら社会主義は偉大で美しいユートピアへの架け橋となるが、それを実現するためには犠牲が付き物だからだ。じきに、人民はこの単純な方程式をよりよく理解することだろう。"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_diversion_for_the_people_desc: "人民は我々が約束を守らぬ場合、抗議することも厭わないだろう。このような困難な時には、内戦の火種になるようなことはほとんどないが、ジダーノフは自らに反体制派に対し振るえる権力があると確信しているわけではない。そのため彼は、人民の繁栄のための新福祉システムの構築を承認した。\n\nもちろん、これは人民の注意をそらす行動でしかない。満腹かつ幸福な人間は自由がなくとも抗議しない。我々はこの単純でかつ重要な公式を利用する。ソビエト連邦の偉大さのためには多かれ少なかれ代償を払わねばならない。偉大さとは、その積み重ねの上に成り立つのだ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_renewed_soviet_patriotism_desc: "愛国心は国家をまとめ上げるが、この国にその単純な等式は通用しない。ソビエト連邦はいつか至上なる社会主義的ユートピアに全世界を包含するだろうが、そこにおいて「通常」の愛国心の普及は意味を持たない。\n\nこの国家が試練の時をも耐え抜くためには、新たなソビエト的アイデンティティと、それを人民の心に植え付けるための施策を行わねばならない。ソビエト連邦はかつて最も偉大なる国家だった。そして、そのふさわしき地位に必ず返り咲くのである！"
 KOM_zhdanov_political_reliability_desc: "リバタリアン社会主義者の連中と違い、我々は人民全員に価値があることを理解している。名もなき集会はすぐに腐敗と内乱に走るが、我々にはより良いやり方がある。安定を確保するため、我々は卓越した能力と社会主義的理想への忠誠を持つ者に頼る必要がある。\n\nそのような人々を党内官僚に見出し権力の座に置くことによって、行政の効率と信頼性をどちらも改善することができるだろう。これこそが真のソビエト的方策だ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_the_state_sphere_desc: "コミには様々な政党があり、その全てが直近の発展には賛同しないだろう。国家における我々の支配を強化するためには、その諸政党に対処する必要がある。譲歩できる場合もあれば説得できる場合もある。そしてその他は……あまり好ましいとは言えないだろう。\n\nソビエト連邦の善のために、我々はすぐにその問題に対処しなければならない。さもなくば、重大な内乱の危険をもたらすことになる。我々は即座に他の政治活動家と対話し、彼らが「社会主義の友人」か「政治的迫害対象」かどちらのリストに入りたいのか、調べる必要がある……"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_paramount_leader_desc: "新ソビエト連邦において、党と政府の分離という幻想は必要ない。社会主義は真実を必要としており、我々は全体力をもって社会主義を現実へと導かねばならない。そのために、我々はコミの旧来的な制度を改善し、新たな国家を表す、より良いものへと向上すべきだろう。\n\n首相職と書記長職を単一のものへとまとめ上げ、真に完璧な社会主義的政府の構築を行う。ソビエト連邦最高指導者、同志ジダーノフ万歳！"

 KOM_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_economy_desc: "我々は自国家の経済が地に落ちたものであることを認識している。内乱とドイツによる恐怖爆撃の20年は国家、そして経済システムを破滅に追いやった。インフラは破壊され、産業も爆撃の目標になる恐怖のために小規模な手工業へと変化し、農業はまるで中世に戻ったかのようで、常に飢饉のリスクを抱えている。\n\n指導者は現状を理解しているが、他の者と違いその対処法を知っている。彼の展望では全てコミをかつての栄光の下に戻すための必要な段階を指し示しており、そうしてソビエト連邦の全回復のための地盤が形成されるのである。指導者が導き、我々は従うのみだ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_revolutionary_course_desc: "かつてソビエト連邦は、その非効率な経済のために敗戦してしまった。ブハーリンは重工業と大規模な機械化を中心とした、強固で集権的な計画経済が求められた時、反対に小規模な産業にこだわった。その間違いを正すのは、我々の役目である。\n\n資源の評価と必要な法的枠組みの構築を行うことで新経済のための土台を築く。こうして、困難な世界情勢の中にあっても国家は強力で知性あふれる手によって人民を導くのである！"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_new_five_year_plan_desc: "新経済政策の第一段階として、注力すべき目標の策定を行う必要がある。我々は五年間の間に国家の直面する主要課題に取り組み、経済の状況を劇的に改善するのだ。しかし初期投資資源の不足という問題を抱えているため、まずは重点を置いて投資すべきセクターを決定せねばならない。その他諸問題に関しては、最初の取り組みが完成された後に扱われることになる。\n\n一方ではインフラ網の再建に関する案がある。道路や鉄道無しでは工業中心地へと資源を運送できないからだ。他方では、新たに重工業を振興することで工業の促進を行う案がある。こうすることで、インフラ再建のために利用できるようになるだろう。"
 KOM_zhdanov_universal_infrastructure_expansion_desc: "ドイツ軍の爆撃や盗賊集団によって、インフラは大きく破壊されてしまった。平時のささやかな通常状態への復帰、そして産業への絶え間ない物資供給を目指すため、我々は破壊された部分の修復と老朽化部分の再建を行う必要がある。\n\nインフラの状態を評価する専門委員会を結成することにより、我々は漸進的な状況の改善に努めることができるだろう。そうして、時間を費やし努力を行うことであらゆる事物の向上を図ることができる。"
 KOM_zhdanov_industrial_lynchpins_desc: "ゴーリキーを始めとするいくつかの大都市は、経済的に高い価値がある。諸都市は高度に発展し、戦災を免れた工業用地があるからだ。これらの都市を生産における要とすることによって、他地域の再建、向上に必要な物資の生産を行なうことができる。\n\nこの地は全身に血を巡らせる心臓のように、ソビエト連邦に新たなエネルギーをもたらす。そうして再建したならば、この国は地球上最も発展した国へと変貌を遂げるだろう！"
 KOM_zhdanov_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc: "ロシアは資源に富んでいるが、その多くは手付かずである。また、戦争及びドイツ空軍による主要な資源採掘場の破壊、孤立化も事態の悪化の一端となっている。これは工業開発計画においてもボトルネックとなっている。\n\n経済の向上のため、我々は既存の施設の再建や改良を行い、さらに鉱脈や主要天然資源の採掘のための生産プラントを構築する必要がある。"
 KOM_zhdanov_urban_resettlement_programs_desc: "ここ20年、ソビエト連邦内において数百万もの都市住民が爆撃、貧困、飢饉から逃れるために別地域へと移住した。辺境における生活は都市においてのそれほど良い物ではなかったが、少なくとも食料はあった。緊急事態を切り抜けた今、都市には動かぬ工場が、地方には多くの失業者が溢れている。\n\n失業対策、それから未来の拡張の準備に向けた産業における人員不足の対策のため、都市への移住計画を実行する。地方に住む若い失業者らは、その計画において近隣の都市への移住－－拒否した場合、強制執行も視野に入れる－－を奨励される。また、我々は計画対象地において住宅建設を行い、建設産業の刺激も同時並行する。"
 KOM_zhdanov_building_the_future_desc: "指導者のいう展望に、嘘偽りはない。彼の巧妙な計画と大いなる洞察力によって、我々はソビエト連邦の経済と人民の生活とを劇的に改善した。生産量は増え続け、インフラは正しく機能し、良好な管理のなされた都市には勤勉な市民が住み始めている。\n\nソビエト連邦の復興の前に、やらなければならないことは多くある。だが、それは正しい道筋を指し示す光でしかない。これ以上過去や失敗に囚われてはならない。自ら、未来への大いなる橋をかけてやらねばならない。同志よ、共に前進せよ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_the_peoples_commissariat_of_science_desc: "超先見的社会主義はただ強い印象を与えるイデオロギーというわけではない。超先見主義を信ずる時、それは科学の持つ自由な力を第一に信じているということだ。社会主義が人民を偏見や迷信から解放するように、人類の進化においては科学的進歩が鍵となる。\n\n社会主義政府が多くの施策の中で、国家と人民の善のために技術的進展を追い求めるのは自然なことであろう。\n\n科学の追求のために我々は新たに科学人民委員部を設立する。これは、科学者が超越文化の探究を自由に、そして熱烈に行うことのできる場所である。"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_future_desc: "科学と社会の進歩の追求を公に掲げる時、その態度を、証拠と共に示さねばならない。教育システムは未だ旧来的で十分な資金もなく、多くの学校がその刷新や全体的な再建を強く希求している。\n\n学校や大学に資金援助を行い、学問を追究する者たちへ新しい、発展型のコースを提供することにより、我々は未来への展望を追い求める。そして同時に、その展望を現実のものへと描き起こすのだ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_psychological_revolution_desc: "心理学は資本主義国家においては見過ごされてしまっている。この学問はブルジョワのポケットに札を突っ込むわけでも、下層階級の奴隷化に与するわけでもなく、無用であるとみなされたからだ。一方で我々はこの学問に、人民の向上のための大きな可能性を見出した。\n\n人間の心理とその内部構造を解き明かすことで、精神と肉体の需要が同等に満たされる社会を築き上げることができる。人民に真の幸福感を与えることにより、社会主義思想とその科学の双方の優位性を示し出すことができるのだ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_experimental_armaments_desc: "我々にはソビエト連邦のための大いなる計画がある。だが、軍は我々の思い描く理想の次元へと達するために苦闘している。人的資源は少なく工業地盤も小さいために、敵を数量で圧倒するというのは望み薄だ。我々は達成できないことに時間を浪費するのではなく、手に届く最良の方策を利用しなければならない。それこそが科学の道である。\n\n新たに科学的進歩に焦点を定めたことで、新兵器の開発を専門とする研究チームの結成が可能となった。高度な兵器を使用して敵に対する圧倒的優位を確保することで、その多くは日光に照らされた雪が溶けるかのように散ってゆくだろう。社会主義科学は我々を優越へと導くのだ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_socialist_society_desc: "我々は夢を達成した。その改革によって、知識の追求を最高の目的とする社会を作り上げた。そう主張するものがいる。また別に、我々が高度な社会主義社会を作り上げたと、そう主張する誤謬に満ちた愚か者も存在している。\n\nこれらは極度の誤りでしかない。\n\n我々はただ始点に立ったのみに過ぎない。今まで行ったことは全て科学革命における布石でしかない。我々は今後数年かけ、その夢を達成するのだ。社会主義的未来、社会主義社会……そして正しき社会主義世界をもたらすのである。さあ、前進せよ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_tractors_for_the_peasants_desc: "我が国の農業はほとんど中世に回帰したも同じだ。農民は管理の行き届いていない農園で育てられる少量の作物に辟易し、その道具も父の父の、そのまた前の世代からのものを使用するなど困窮している。これは受け入れ難いことだ。ソビエト連邦をかつての状態へと再建するため、成長し続ける都市が充足するレベルでの食糧供給を行わねばならない。\n\nそのために、農民に配給する現代的トラクターと農業用機械の獲得のための予算を組む必要がある。農業の革新的な機械化によって、農地の総生産量が向上するのみならず、工場における労働人口を増やすことができるだろう。こうして、社会はそれ自身の力によって社会主義へと向かい始めるのである！"
 KOM_zhdanov_industrial_farming_operations_desc: "トラクターや自動脱穀機を持つことだけが機械的農業というわけではない。機械的農業とは近代的農業方式を農民に教授したり、効率の良い輸送経路を開発すること、強い作物を選り抜くことなど、この他にも沢山の意味を包含する。\n\n千年もの間、農業は伝統的で、そして運任せであり続けた。社会主義の新時代が訪れようとする今、その両者を放置することは許されない。新たな技術と効果的な計画によって、地方を生産的な地域へと作り替える。人民の善、そして社会主義のための利益をここに生み出すのだ。"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_army_desc: "我らが赤軍は、比較的新しい組織だ。この軍隊は旧コミ共和国における社会主義者の支配が完成するまでの混沌の中で生まれ、指揮統制の崩壊を起こすことなく攻撃作戦を遂行する能力がある。\n\nだが残念ながら、「能力がある」だけである。社会主義の敵はその強さを増しており、統一戦争時の敵よりも大いなる脅威となっている。将来の避けられぬ戦争に対して備えるために、赤軍はかつての栄光の姿を取り戻さねばならない。かつてファシストの圧政に立ち向かった、かの大いなる軍の姿に立ち返るのである。"
 KOM_zhdanov_lessons_from_the_west_russian_war_desc: "第二次祖国戦争、またの名を西ロシア戦争は、ロシアという国の軍隊が団結し戦った最後の戦争である。赤軍の力強い攻撃によってファシストはたちまちA-A線から撤退し、そのほとんどが壊滅に至ろうとしていた。だが、勝利間近というところで軍は痛手を被り、同時に反逆者らがその勝利を我らから奪った。\n\n我々は両陣営の戦術、戦略を研究する必要がある。第二次祖国戦争はある意味では来るべき戦争の前兆であり、全派閥が前例なき戦争理論を用いた。赤軍の圧倒的な攻撃はもちろん研究するに値するが、同様にファシストの奇跡的な再起にも見習うべきところはあるはずだ。"
 KOM_zhdanov_an_army_for_the_world_desc: "第二次祖国戦争に次ぐ沈滞以降世界に平和が真に訪れたことはなく、列強と呼ばれる国々は地球上のさまざまな代理戦争に首を突っ込んだ。それら小規模な紛争では、技術的革新のもたらすあらゆる結果が披露された。それならば、それらの軍事衝突で用いられた戦略を精査し、我々の大義へと転用すべきだろうか？\n\n特に、南アフリカ戦争は赤軍司令部にとって格好の研究対象だと考えられている。かの血腥い代理戦争は、空挺歩兵部隊や両軍による非対称戦術など、現代戦の新たな展望が垣間見えるものだった。アフリカの丘陵やジャングルからの教訓は、ロシアの森林やツンドラにおいても有用なものだろう。"
 KOM_zhdanov_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc: "西ロシアは赤旗の下に再び統一を成し遂げたが、ここに至るまでには多くの血が流された。地域の統一のために行われた数々の戦いでは、第二次祖国戦争以来の流血が起こった。この戦争は赤軍の勝利に終わったといえども、その欠陥点を浮かび上がらせた。再統一への道筋を歩む前に、これを修正せねばならない。\n\n赤軍が蹂躙した軍閥では、それぞれが各々の戦略を用い、各々の方法で統制を保っていた。我々は戦った敵軍全てを見直し、その長所を取り入れ短所を退けるようにして、それらを統合する。"
 KOM_zhdanov_an_army_for_the_motherland_desc: "敵とのファーストコンタクトにおいて計画はその意味をなさないというのはよく言及されることであり、統一戦争においてはその傾向がかなり顕著であった。敵に対して綿密な計画を練っていたとしても、予想外の展開によって指揮系統が混乱し対応が遅れることが多々あった。その間、前線の部隊は苦しみ、将校は行動決定に際して狼狽するしかなかった。\n\nこれら個々の問題は、部隊戦術の体系の柔軟化を行えば、容易に解決できたはずだ。そこで前線の将官に更なる決定権を付与し、戦闘中に指揮体系の崩壊が起きた場合にその場その場での対応を行えるようにする。将官は上位組織からの指令に頼るのではなく自らの持つ主導権を行使し、個々の部隊がそれぞれの戦術を活用するのだ。"
 KOM_zhdanov_the_next_generation_desc: "我らの努力は成果を生んでいる。我らが赤軍は10年ほど前A-A線を超えファシストの占領地域へと突入した部隊の姿に近づきつつあり、またついに職業軍へと形を変えつつある。しかし、実際のところまだ完璧なわけではない。現在の赤軍は10年前の部隊の精粋を集めたものだと考えられているが、やっと現代的な水準に追いついたというのが実情である。\n\n書記長は現代化への徹底的な注力を目指し、赤軍の予算の大規模な引き上げを承認した。世界から立ち遅れることはもうない！現代の最先端技術と新しく直感的な戦術を適用することで、赤軍は現代戦においても戦い抜ける軍隊へと変貌するだろう。"
 KOM_zhdanov_the_kazan_military_academy_desc: "カザンにはブハーリン時代に創設された九つの「スヴォーロフ士官学校」のうちの一つが設置されていた。この特別な全寮制学校は若年者に対し二次的かつ軍事的な教育を施すために設立され、赤軍将校の多くがこの学校の卒業生である。しかし、ソビエト連邦の崩壊以降、カザンの士官学校はほとんど使われなくなってしまった。\n\n我々はこれを改良し、新たな施設、カザン陸軍士官学校として再開すべきだろう。この学校は二次教育ではなく、赤軍将校の育成という特別な目的のために利用される。カザンのこの学校が再設置されれば、次世代の赤軍将校団を組織することができるようになるだろう。"
 KOM_zhdanov_doctrinal_refinement_desc: "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 KOM_zhdanov_the_unions_finest_desc: "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 KOM_zhdanov_a_cutting_edge_rifle_desc: "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We shall begin trials with a variety of new and revolutionary designs, submitted by our finest visionaries and weapons designers. The key to defeating Germany may very well be a cutting-edge rifle!"
 KOM_zhdanov_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc: "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 KOM_zhdanov_the_new_northern_fleet_desc: "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force. The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 KOM_zhdanov_revive_the_air_force_desc: "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."
 KOM_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_world_desc: "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 KOM_zhdanov_restore_international_trade_desc: "While one of the many nations of the world may seek to buid a series of embassies to represent the \"governments\" of foreign nation, our Federation is not a mere nation amongst equals. Our Federation is in its own league - the seed of a socialist superculture that shall one day grow to encompass most of the world. Thusly, rather than the standard diplomatic practices of most nations, the Paramount Leader has ordered the Foreign Ministry to construct a grand edifice in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] - the Embassy of the Global Proletariat.\n\nThis edifice shall contain representatives of the working class across the world, with delegates that embody the spirit of the working class of each and every nation. While our relations may be limited now, there is no reason to limit ourselves - nations that refuse to send delegates shall be properly represented as well, by Soviet citizens that best exemplify the socialization of the working class within their host nation's civilization. Regardless of their willingness to adhere to our policies, the world shall be represented, in the true spirit of socialist internationalism!"
 KOM_zhdanov_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc: "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 KOM_zhdanov_mission_to_nuuk_desc: "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 KOM_zhdanov_the_scandanavian_mission_desc: "Europe lies under a steel wall of fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 KOM_zhdanov_request_swedish_reconciliation_desc: "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 KOM_zhdanov_congratulate_free_norway_desc: "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 KOM_zhdanov_an_english_embassy_desc: "誇り高き英国人でさえナチス・ドイツの伸長、親ドイツ政府の台頭の前には手も足も出なかった。しかし、その政府は今や放逐された。英国人は自らその不法な傀儡政権を打倒し、独立国家を再建した。ファシストに果敢に立ち向かったのだ。\n\nしかし闘争は終わっていない。国際的オブザーバーの多くがドイツによる復讐、英国における傀儡政権の復活の可能性を唱えている。もしそうなれば、我々は軍事的な支援という形で共に抵抗するだろう。彼らが我々の政府を承認すれば、可能な限り多くの兵器、弾薬を送り届けられるようになる。"
 KOM_zhdanov_international_socialist_solidarity_desc: "旧ソビエト連邦の崩壊と共に、共産主義インターナショナルも放棄され、ついには消滅した。我々は再びこの炎を灯し、世界的な協力体制を推進する組織を構築するのだ。\n\n新たな共産主義インターナショナルの設立、という提案がなされている。かつてのインターナショナルのように、コミンテルンは経済的、政治的側面において各国の社会主義政党間の協力をさらに加速させるだろう。闇の中にあっても、コミンテルンは革命が試練を乗り越え拡大する手助けとなるはずだ。結束よ、永遠なれ！"
 KOM_zhdanov_condemn_reactionary_imperialism_desc: "世界中の資本主義者、ファシストに内在する帝国主義はその限界を知らない。その帝国主義的勢力中でも凶悪なのがドイツである。奴らはアフリカからモスクワ、果てはかつて注目されることのなかった月の海までもを征服した。その無謀で血まみれの狂気はソビエトの地にも到達し、そこで暴力を働き、その退行的専制主義者はかつて自由だった社会に影を落とした。これは許されざるべきことだ。我々はドイツに直接声明を送り、その退行的本性と恐怖に満ちた帝国主義を非難する。返信が来るとは思えないが、その避けられぬ運命を知らしめるというのはかの反動的指導者に我々がかけられる最大限の慈悲だろう。"

Our government was elected thanks to the efforts of the Party, and from it come our most important and competent advisors and ministers. Denying such a simple truth is akin to madness!\n\nIn order to show our gratitude to the party, the government will make sure to consult it often, and party officials and bureaucrats will receive several additional duties within the government, so that they may integrate even more perfectly our state with our party doctrine."
 KOM_suslov_uplift_progressive_values_desc: "Socialism is so much more than merely a political ideology. It is a culture, a set of values to use every day: we can even say that socialism is a way of life, the most perfect in the world! In socialism, the workers work as much as the nation demands, and they receive everything they need to make their lives meaningful and worth living.\n\nWith our renewed emphasis on our socialist roots, we should make sure that everyone understands that socialism is something that permeates their entire lives, not just the electoral urn. To this end, we'll enact a propaganda campaign aimed at exalting socialist values and their contribution to society."
 KOM_suslov_the_new_soviet_woman_desc: "For centuries, capitalists and religious leaders have forced the woman to bend to their will, binding their free will and intellect with moral chains and derogative concepts such as \"queen of the house\" and \"naturally destined to motherhood\"\n\nIn our free socialist Russia, women are equal to men under all aspects! We shall demand that they do as men, and we shall grant them the same rights and choices any man gets. Farmer, teacher, mother, soldier, general secretary: if they show the attitude, they'll find a way to it!"
 KOM_suslov_proclaim_social_equality_desc: "Like hammer and sickle, man and woman are fundamental to socialism, each with their own role. We proclaim the freedom of all workers from the shackles imposed by capitalism and moralism, and the role of the woman will no longer be that of a glorified cook and babymaker!\n\nAt the same, we understand that man and woman have each their own peculiarities. Equality must be tempered by the laws of nature, and while a woman will never be forced to assume a role she doesn't want, we should still incentivize all to follow the path evolution has set."
 KOM_suslov_encourage_the_people_desc: "Unlike the autocracies or the false democracies, the Soviet Union is made firstly by its workers and citizens! We are the only ones who truly let the common man and woman participate to the government, and it is extremely important for the health of our political system that as many as possible take interest in politics.\n\nThe socialist revolution and the class struggle are permanent features of our life as long as a single nation on Earth is still ruled by the bourgeois, and all loyal Soviet citizens should fulfill their duty to the cause of Lenin, be it in the factory, on the field of battle or in the hall of the Presidium!"
 KOM_suslov_unity_in_purpose_desc: "The old Soviet Union was plagued by infighting. Political deviance was regarded as religious heresy, and many were burned at the stake - some even literally - for a slight deviation from party doctrine. If we want our new Union to stand the test of time, we need to unite rather than divide, and convince rather than force: we won't make the same mistakes as our predecessors, we can't afford it right now!\n\nTo this end, we'll accept all those who truly believe in the socialist cause, no matter their shade of red. In difficult times, we need all the friends we need.\n\nSo long as they learn the true way of Marxist orthodoxy in time."
 KOM_suslov_the_revolution_renewed_desc: "After a long struggle, a truly socialist government has been restored, and we have begun marching once again towards the rising sun! Despite our difficult times, we have restored the people's faith in Lenin's heirs, and our party stands united by the general secretary's side.\n\nLenin set something beautiful in motion, more than fifty years ago. Now, it falls upon us to continue his legacy: the revolutionary spirit hasn't been crushed by the German panzers, and neither has it been blown apart by the Luftwaffe. Now, we renew our vows to the permanent revolution, to see its flame burn bright: workers of the world, forward!"
 KOM_suslov_revive_the_economy_desc: "After twenty years of civil strife and German bombings, the once powerful Soviet industrial machine has long since been relieved of its mortal worries. Abandoned factories litter what few cities can still pride themselves of such a name, their roofs collapsed under the bomb or due to neglect, their machineries broken beyond repairs.\n\nOur infrastructure too has been reduced to ashes, with roads, bridges and railroads interrupted by craters or floods, and our agricultural sector barely manages to feed our populace. Famine is a common issue for our beleaguered nation, and nothing will change if we can't at least keep our men and women from starving to death.\n\nStill, from difficulties come opportunities. With the German bombings gone, we have the chance, for the first time since the beginning of this nightmare, to better our condition: plans will be drafter, resources will be stored, and a new age of socialist industrialization will begin for the new Soviet Union! By the hammer and the sickle!"
 KOM_suslov_empower_the_gosplan_desc: "The Gosplan was founded by Bukharin as the economic planning board of the old Soviet Union. In the end, it wasn't used much due to his preference for light industry, and the results became evident during the war. While the agency has way less resources than our Motherland at the height of her power, we'll use our resources in a much more considerate manner.\n\nWe'll immediately assign enough personnel and funds to the agency so that it may begin drafting long-period plans for our economy, and devise short-term solutions for the issues currently plaguing our country. Our plans will reach much further than what we can achieve now, and we'll be prepared for anything that may come at us!"
 KOM_suslov_towards_the_next_phase_desc: "With our final goal being the establishment of a true communist regime, we need to set the first stones in our economy just as we are doing in politics. The state must oversee the entire economy, planning with precision and care the future needs of the country and the people, and ensure that production never exceeds demand, or vice versa.\n\nBy carefully balancing our resources for maximum industrial growth, and planning for the long term in case anything happens, we'll kick start both our economy and our advance towards true communism! The Soviet Union advances!"
 KOM_suslov_oversee_the_planning_desc: "The Gosplan has started working, and the resulting plans are satisfying to say the least. By further increasing their funds and personnel, we'll have both a tighter control over the economy, and more experts dedicated to the betterment of the Soviet people.\n\nAs our economy starts recovering, it is fundamental that we remain steady and do not fall prey to excesses. Even growing too much can be detrimental in the long run, and we must make sure that we do everything flawlessly."
 KOM_suslov_expand_central_production_nodes_desc: "Right now, our industries are located primarily around our few cities, with the capital being the most prominent. However, we'll need much more if we are to see our plans turned into reality: Gorky and the other industrial nodes must first be brought back into functioning order by repairing damaged or obsolete infrastructure, and bringing in modern machinery from wherever we can fetch it.\n\nOnce the preliminary work is done, we can start expanding them, interconnecting the region with modern railroads and building more industries, that will in turn give work to the masses of impoverished farmers coming from the countryside. Slowly but steadily, we'll increase our production capabilities, until we are poised to begin with the real economic struggle!"
 KOM_suslov_honor_the_peasants_desc: "One of the greatest mistakes of the Soviet Union was its excessive reliance on industrial cities. The people need to eat as much as they need in order to be both healthy and loyal, and in the larger scheme of things, a famine can be as much as a catastrophe as any military defeat.\n\nThe farmers are a fundamental part of any country, and especially a socialist one. No one will ever be allowed to think them \"inferior\" to industrial workers or to the bourgeois, and anyone daring to take their contribution for granted will be punished: an army marches on its stomach, and this is valid for countries too!"
 KOM_suslov_mechanize_the_kolkhozes_desc: "The Kolkhozes are collective farms organized by the state so that they can achieve maximum production efficiency. Until now, with our limited means this mainly meant that agricultural tools such as plows and scythes were shared between the farmers and that the workforce was assembled following centralized plans.\n\nWith our renewed focus on industrialization and economic growth, we shall finance a large agricultural mechanization plan for the Kolkhozes. Buying large stocks of farming machines such as tractors or threshing machines, we'll bring our agricultural sector out of the age of the tsars and into the modern age of socialism! Production will increase tenfolds, and farmers will be much happier as they no longer have to break their backs on the fields!"
 KOM_suslov_develop_refining_infrastructure_desc: "Oil refining is a complicated process that requires large investments. In the days of the old Soviet Union, the oil fields in the Caucasus covered our domestic needs, but we no longer have such a luxury: fuel is a rare and precious resource to obtain, and often the only way to get some is to pay black market dealers or rely on fickle peace treaties between several warlords.\n\nA modern industrial society can't survive without such a fundamental resource, and as such it is our duty to secure a stable and reliable source of the liquid gold. By funding the construction of refineries across our nation we'll make sure that our industries and mines have at least their basic needs satisfied until we can find some real oil."
 KOM_suslov_increase_resource_production_quotas_desc: "Our industrial sector is growing, which means our need for raw materials such as iron, coal, copper, wood, and many others is steadily increasing. With our mining sector already established, it will be difficult to find entirely new ore veins yet untapped, and we can't simply rely on luck.\n\nTo this end, we'll increase resource production quotas. By funding the acquisition of more modern machineries, improving mining crew training, and creating a new culture of Stakhanovism, we'll maximize the output of our current mining facilities, reducing costs across the board: socialism is the way forward!"
 KOM_suslov_new_industrial_centers_desc: "Our main cities have developed nicely ever since we began our re-industrialization plan. However, relying too much on few large industrial nodes would make ourselves vulnerable: if twenty years of Luftwaffe bombings have taught us anything, diversifying production, and spreading out our industry, is the only way to keep going under duress.\n\nAs an additional benefit, funding the expansion and conversion of large agricultural towns into proper industrial cities will offer work to even more unemployed or poor people, and spread the ideals of socialism to the farthest reaches of our domain. From today, we start building the Soviet Union of tomorrow!"
 KOM_suslov_towards_a_stable_currency_desc: "While the final goal of socialism and communism is the eventual abolition of the currency, to be replaced with a just system where everyone gives what he can give to the state and receives what he needs from the community, we all know there's still a long way to go until we can even start to think about this. As such, we need to keep a currency, if only to trade with outside and to not impoverish the poor even more.\n\nThe Ruble of the Soviet Union has been kept as our official currency during these troubled times, but it has been devalued so much it no longer has any meaningful value: if we want a stable economy, we need to enact a comprehensive monetary reform to stabilize the currency and peg its value to fixed indexes decided by the state."
 KOM_suslov_the_road_to_recovery_desc: "To say that the Soviet Union has endured difficult times would be the general secretary of understatements. We have been subjected to twenty years of plundering, bombings, civil wars, famine, diseases, and every kind of disaster that could befall human civilization. If recovery was a road, it would be longer than the Trans-Siberian Railroad!\n\nWith our efforts and our faith in socialism, however, we have finally turned the tables. While it will still take years - perhaps decades - to return to true prosperity, we have achieved admirable results in our quest for reconstruction: the people are no longer famished, and our industries are filled with hard-working crews proud of their role within society.\n\nOne day, we'll restore the Soviet Union to what it was before, just you wait!"
 KOM_suslov_the_soviet_education_system_desc: "One of the greatest changes the Soviet Union brought was free basic education for all. Under the Tsars, peasants weren't allowed to study in order to keep them forever under the nobles' thumb: with education comes innovation, and with innovation comes power!\n\nSadly, twenty years of civil strife and German bombings have destroyed the old education system in both a physical and metaphorical sense. With schools razed to the ground, and children forced to work to feed themselves and their families, learning has become a secondary, or even tertiary concerns.\n\nWe shall no longer tolerate such injustice! Our children need to learn so that they may improve both themselves and Mother Russia: we shall rebuild the old schools, and teach a new generation of young boys and girls the value of culture, and through it, how to be an outstanding Soviet citizen!"
 KOM_suslov_an_ideological_education_desc: "The traditional teaching methods and subjects are fine for elementary schools. Superior education, however - especially universities - needs to adapt to the new times, or we risk stagnation.\n\nBy introducing new study courses, and experimental curricula, we can revolutionize our education and help our students find what they excel at. Revolutionary minds produce revolutionary ideas, and the Soviet Union is the very embodiment of the concept of revolution!"
 KOM_suslov_expand_vocational_schools_desc: "Vocational schools teach young students with clear ideas about their future all about a single craft. While entrenched intellectuals consider them somewhat inferior to traditional universities, we are not as blind as them: from their classes come the next generations of artisans, engineers, farmers and bureaucrats, professions upon which lay the very foundation of a country!\n\nWe shall increase foundings to vocational schools, and give those brave boys and girls the best possible education. With it, they will be able to excel, and through it, they will elevate the Soviet Union to new heights of innovation and power: we all serve the nation, and we all deserve the best for it!"
 KOM_suslov_an_innovative_union_desc: "Gone are the days of decadence and backwardness. Gone are the fields tended by farmers and the factories where workers toiled with obsolete farmers. Gone are the child-workers and the empty classrooms. This is a new Russia, a new Union, where progress, for both the nation and the people, reigns supreme.\n\nWe have done so much, but we still have much more to do. The past is no longer stalking us, and now we are the ones chasing the future: new investments in science and education will send us barreling into a new era of progress!"
 KOM_suslov_restore_the_red_army_desc: "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following socialist rule coming to the old Komi Republic, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, \"good enough\" simply won't cut it. The enemies of socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the Unification Wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, the Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against fascist tyranny many years ago."
 KOM_suslov_lessons_from_the_second_patriotic_war_desc: "全ロシアが団結して戦った戦争は第二次祖国戦争、通称西ロシア戦争が最後である。赤軍の力強い攻勢はファシストに大いなる打撃を与え、A-A線から後退させ、戦線全体を崩壊寸前にまで追いやった。だが、勝利の甘美も束の間、我々の軍は痛手を負い、裏切り者によって勝利は奪われた。\n\n我々は両軍が使用した戦略を研究する。第二次祖国戦争は全軍がまだ見ぬ戦術理論を利用した、来るべきあらゆる戦争の先駆であった。赤軍の行った大攻勢は研究するにふさわしいものであるが、ファシストの反攻にも同様のことが言えるのである。"
 KOM_suslov_study_foreign_strategy_desc: "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 KOM_suslov_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc: "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 KOM_suslov_tactical_flexibility_desc: "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 KOM_suslov_a_modernized_force_desc: "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 KOM_suslov_the_kazan_military_academy_desc: "Kazan is home to one of nine \"Suvorov Schools\" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 KOM_suslov_doctrinal_refinement_desc: "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 KOM_suslov_the_revolutionary_soldier_desc: "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 KOM_suslov_avtomat_kalashnikova_desc: "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We will begin trials on a new standard battle rifle for the Red Army, deriving from the tried-and-tested design of the AK-47. In time, our troops will hopefully get their hands on a weapon even more effective than the vaunted Kalashnikov."
 KOM_suslov_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc: "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 KOM_suslov_the_new_northern_fleet_desc: "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force. The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 KOM_suslov_the_red_air_force_desc: "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."
 KOM_suslov_returning_to_the_world_desc: "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 KOM_suslov_restore_international_trade_desc: "The White Sea now lies open to us, and yet we still have no proper fleet to conduct international trade with. The nature of the arctic waters makes this task more difficult than it would seem. The port of Arkhangelsk is almost entirely frozen over during the winter months, and thus our merchant marine will require a specialized fleet of icebreakers to clear a path through to our trade partners.\n\nAccording to our foreign office, the nations of Scandinavia are already quite receptive to our offers of establishing trade. Due to their close proximity to our ports, they would be a relatively hassle-free journey for our merchant fleets as long as they are able to circumvent the frigid conditions of the White Sea."
 KOM_suslov_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc: "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 KOM_suslov_contact_the_OFN_desc: "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 KOM_suslov_the_gateway_to_europe_desc: "Europe lies under a steel wall of fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 KOM_suslov_the_swedish_diplomatic_mission_desc: "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 KOM_suslov_approach_free_norway_desc: "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 KOM_suslov_an_english_embassy_desc: "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 KOM_suslov_open_the_rykov_conference_desc: "The Soviet Union was once the bulwark of the global socialist cause, sponsoring their comrades from around the world no matter where they came from. Ever since the collapse, however, this mantle has gone unclaimed for nearly two decades. With a socialist government restored to West Russia, we must regain the initiative.\n\nThe idea has been floated of holding a conference in Rykov in the interest of fostering relations with socialist parties from across the globe and reaffirming our commitment to the international worker. Representatives from hundreds of countries would be invited to attend, and discuss how to proceed with advancing our mutual goals. This conference will hopefully reestablish our government as the preeminent socialist power and a friend to the workers of the world."
 KOM_suslov_propose_the_socintern_desc: "The Rykov Conference was a good first step to reestablishing solidarity with fellow socialists from around the world, but we can go even farther. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Communist International has been proposed. Like the Internationals that came before it, the ComIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the ComIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"

 KOM_bukharina_a_triumph_for_the_soviets_desc: "At last, socialism has reigned supreme in Russia and in the way the Soviets intended. However, we must ensure that the regime does not become a vast, endless bureaucracy of Communist Party officials all governing thanks to fear of the leader striking down upon them.\n\nWith its reunification, West Russia provides an excellent opportunity to experiment and prove the effectiveness of true council communism. The workers' councils, the original soviets, will be restored to their positions of power, and they will be the ones to make decisions through a reformed system of government. No one is denying that this won't be an easy task, but this is why the General Secretary has assembled a team of the best people ready to get down to work and restore true socialism."
 KOM_bukharina_assemble_the_presidium_desc: "To give power to the workers, a system of a bicameral legislature has been conceived by General Secretary Bukharina. The Congress of Soviets will be a large body for which hundreds of soviet representatives, hard workers from all across free Russia, are elected. They, in turn, vote on the members of the Presidium, the upper house as westerners would call it. Presidium members are to be carefully proposed by the General Secretary herself, as they will need to be capable of fulfilling their role as her chief advisors and planners.\n\nThere are many possible candidates for Presidium members - others are officials from the old Union prepared to serve it once again, while others are young, rising stars with great ambitions. Only the best will be chosen, and they will be assigned with tasks important if we are to reach our former glory."
 KOM_bukharina_soviet_humanism_desc: "It is no secret that the USSR of old was... not exactly a champion of human rights. General Secretary Bukharina recognizes this, and knows of the events that took place in the interwar period in Russia. However, it will be the goal of the new regime to change the public perception of itself, from an allegedly totalitarian state to one of equality and opportunity.\n\nIn the age of communication, it has never been easier to spread a message through radio and on television. The government will use that to its advantage, and reaffirm to its people and to the world that it is dedicated to the principles of humanism, and to an egalitarian society different from the failed Union. Once we have done that, we can begin to make sure it becomes the reality on the ground, and a new era for the nation will be ushered in."
 KOM_bukharina_a_free_woman_desc: "The fact that a woman is the leader of the state is already a testament to the equal opportunities presented by the new Union, but it is not quite enough. As per the General Secretary's wish, steps will be taken in the direction of gender equality within the framework of the socialist state. To begin with, a committee will be formed of special advisors from both genders on Comrade Bukharina's orders, and its purpose will be none other than to support social equality and solve any disputes in that regard. From there, it will be a process of gradually getting laws and amendments passed, so that women may finally be free and equal to men in the workplace, at home, and in society as a whole."
 KOM_bukharina_a_free_worker_desc: "The goal of a communist state is, above all, to guarantee the freedom and the power of the common worker. The government understands this, and will immediately begin taking progressive measures with said goal in mind. Primitive laws on workers' rights already exist, but they are often not optimal or are not followed in certain areas. These laws will be reformed and codified as per the wishes of the Congress and the Presidium, while those who do not follow them are to be punished accordingly. In addition, the changes will be publicized through media, so that everyone learns of the leaps the new Union has made."
 KOM_bukharina_return_to_kollontai_desc: "数少ない女性のオールド・ボリシェヴィキの1人であるアレクサンドラ・コロンタイは女性の権利と善良な理性のための闘士であったとよく言及される。彼女はマルクス主義的フェミニズムの先駆けであり、あらゆる面における性的平等性はボリシェヴィキが計画し実行したような社会主義革命によってのみ達成されえると説いた。\n\nその平等は未だ完全に達成されてはいないだろうが、同志ブハーリナの意思と同志コロンタイの遺産を引き継ぐ我々の義務とで、達成しなければならない。このイデオロギーを受け入れるだけでなく、これを法律に適用することで新たな連邦におけるイデオロギー、政策面における主部の構成材料とする。そうすることで、ロシアこそが平等の闘士であることという態度を確立し、問題へと真に立ち向かう国家であるということを示すのだ。"
 KOM_bukharina_a_culture_of_questioning_desc: "The Russians and other ethnicities inside our borders are often defined by century-old traditions and moral codes. However, what do they matter if all they do is hold us back and prevent progress comparable to the rest of the world? Lenin and Bukharin started launched the idea of questioning these long-lasting traditions as they occasionally proved to be hurdles in the development of society, but never finished it. The warlord era was another blow to these new ideas, but we are here to fix that.\n\nThe General Secretary and the Presidium have agreed on a course of action through which the state will encourage rethinking these ancient cultural trends. An abundance of speeches and propaganda will help to achieve much-needed progress."
 KOM_bukharina_empower_the_councils_desc: "As the next step in giving the workers more power over their jobs, the local soviets across the country will be trusted with a certain level of control and self-autonomy. They will be allowed to set forth their own candidates for representation, as well as be the ones who decide quotas for production and several other measures that deal with their own workplace.\n\nOf course, the Presidium understands that no group can be completely trustworthy when they have control, and for that reason the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation will be useful. As the service to ensure everything runs smoothly, they will be observing the different factories and councils, seeking any dishonest men and women who would dare lie about their reports and work."
 KOM_bukharina_open_the_government_desc: "In order to ensure a truly free society, the government must be transparent and open with the people. In order to raise the people's confidence in our state apparatus, we shall open certain archives for public viewing, and pass an order to declassify certain documents after a statute of limitations has passed. Whilst the security apparatus is important, and some things must remained buried, to be open and honest about the People's government is a paramount task."
 KOM_bukharina_for_your_own_good_desc: "A free society is important, but the government cannot always be liberal with its recordkeeping. If the security of the state is compromised, even for ostensibly pure reasons, then all will be in danger. As such, we cannot make government records public. This is especially true for information pertaining to state security. It may not be popular, but the people will understand that it is for their own good."
 KOM_bukharina_declare_an_extraordinary_session_desc: "Despite the best efforts of resurgent Russia to combat any remaining counter-revolutionary movements, some cells and underground groups still linger and remind us of the days of the Komi Republic's turbulent politics. Suslovite and Zhdanovite supporters continue to exist both among the citizens of the country and in some cases inside the government, perhaps plotting to overthrow it.\n\nThis cannot stand. The Presidium, responsible for governing the country, and the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation, responsible for keeping it safe, will convene as soon as possible to discuss solutions to this urgent matter. Under the supervision of the General Secretary, their task for the near future will be to eliminate the last threats to the state, so that we can move forward."
 KOM_bukharina_a_loyal_police_force_desc: "Our past of cooperation with Suslovite and Zhdanovite elements still haunts us, as they have contacts in important positions even to this day. For example, the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation - a body meant to serve the government and protect its people - has possibly been infiltrated by these revisionists, and must now be reformed.\n\nTrusted men and women, who have stood on the side of the General Secretary since the early days, will be put in charge of the operation to identify and purge any possible dissidents and agents. Anyone deemed disloyal inside the URS will be discharged, and if their treason to the state is proven, tried for their crimes. Only through a clean police force will the revolution be able to survive and expand."
 KOM_bukharina_blind_the_ultravisionaries_desc: "The strange and esoteric ideas of the Ultravisionaries are, ultimately, dangerous to the welfare and security of the state. It is clear that Zhdanov's faction must be dealt with. Known members will be expelled from government office, their leaders will be discredited in the court of public opinion, and they will be watched carefully for the rest of their lives. This bizarre cult will be excised, as cleanly and decisively as possible."
 KOM_bukharina_shackle_the_dogmatists_desc: "Mikhail Suslov's hardline faction has been sidelined, and Suslov himself removed from the equation entirely. However, we still need to deal with many of its members who remain in public office. They need not be purged as thoroughly as Zhdanov's people, but we still must remove them from positions of power. A few retirements here, and a few reassignments there. The old dogmatists must not be able to threaten our efforts."
 KOM_bukharina_peace_at_last_desc: "At last, our position in the government is secure. The esotericists and hardliners have been removed from power, and any threat that they would pose to us has been effectively neutralized. We still need to ensure that those in government who have voiced concerns are properly dealt with, but after some stern messaging, they should get the picture. Our republic has been united under the left, and we may move towards a better future for all."
 KOM_bukharina_the_march_to_utopia_desc: "With our republic's new government united and strong, we can begin the march towards the society of the future. We will create a society of total social equality, justice for all, unity among all the working peoples of the world, and where true Communism has been finally achieved, once and for all. The workers of our republic will control their destinies, our scientists will design a new future for humanity, our farmers and agronomists will feed a hungry world, and our brave soldiers will defend the people's revolution, come what may. What began in the salons of Switzerland and the backrooms of Syktyvkar will reach the hearts and minds of all humanity. The final stage of society is on the horizon, and we will reach it!"
 KOM_bukharina_an_economy_of_the_people_desc: "The fall of the USSR during the First Patriotic War was, among many other things, caused by the flaws in its economic system. While our predecessors surely tried their best at organizing a socialist economy, in the end they failed due to both technological and ideological limitations.\n\nIf we are to rebuild Russia, we need to create a functional economy, where the citizen receives from the state what he or she needs, and gives in return his loyalty and his work. With such reforms, we'll be one step ahead of our competitors, and we'll create a country both powerful and fair!"
 KOM_bukharina_learning_from_the_past_desc: "Despite his faults - and ultimate failure - Bukharin had great ideas and great plans for the Soviet Union. While we intend to surpass him, it would be foolish to simply discard all his work: instead, we'll learn from his reforms, and salvage what good he did so that he may serve the Motherland even after his passing.\n\nBy studying his Siberian Development Plan, focusing on infrastructural innovations and subsidizing light industry, we'll be able to boost our economy and dramatically increase our industrial base, which will greatly benefit both the people and the country as a whole."
 KOM_bukharina_a_union_of_workers_desc: "Rather than the German-held industries, where slaves toil and die in both cruel and inefficient ways, we aim to free the worker by granting him not only a fair salary, but the knowledge he needs to improve both his standing and his productivity.\n\nIf we instruct our factory crews on the latest advancements in industrial production methods, we'll create a loyal and skilled workforce, and make a great leap forward in our quest to save Mother Russia!"
 KOM_bukharina_and_a_union_of_peasants_desc: "One of the greatest mistakes of the Soviet Union was its excessive reliance on industrial cities. The people need to eat as much as they need in order to be both healthy and loyal, and in the larger scheme of things, a famine can be as much as a catastrophe as any military defeat.\n\nBy providing our farmers with modern machinery subsidized by the state, and teaching them how to properly use and maintain them, agricultural output will increase tenfolds. An army marches on its stomach, and this is valid for countries too!"
 KOM_bukharina_the_special_developmental_commission_desc: "Russia is vast, and there are large swathes of land full of yet untapped potential. Natural resources waiting to be exploited, fertile land abandoned, and broken infrastructure can be found all across the Motherland, and even within the part that we control.\n\nBy establishing a commission tasked with the individuation and development of such areas is of paramount importance if we are to establish ourselves as serious contenders for the unification of Russia: failure won't be tolerated, nor forgiven!"
 KOM_bukharina_urban_industrial_development_desc: "Our cities have been hit hard by the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent German bombings. Thousands of people live in huts as their homes have been destroyed, and damaged power lines and industrial machinery jeopardize our production efforts.\n\nWithout industry, there is no Soviet Union, which means that we have to restore our cities and industrial hubs to their former glory. Repairing urban areas, restoring electric power and kickstarting our industry will slowly but surely bring us back into shape, and the people will surely appreciate it."
 KOM_bukharina_integrate_regional_infrastructure_desc: "Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, many warlords and disloyal officers have claimed pieces of Russia as their own. Throughout the years, roads, railroads and power lines were disrupted, repaired, sabotaged, rebuilt and destroyed again by a variety of different actors: as a result, emergency repairs and lack of standardization plague our country and cripple our economy.\n\nBy instituting a new and uniform set of standards - especially in rail gauge - we'll be able to slowly integrate the infrastructures scattered across Komi, and it will be a starting point for our future endeavors should we be able to expand and reclaim the lost lands of the Soviet Union."
 KOM_bukharina_rural_agricultural_development_desc: "Now that we have set the basis by teaching our farmers about the modern agricultural production methods, we can bring this a step forward by establishing a concerted development effort for our farmlands.\n\nBy subsidizing larger infrastructures such as aqueducts and irrigation channels, that individual farmers would never be able to affort, we can not only increase our agricultural output, but also foster a sense of gratitude among those who will benefit from our efforts. We serve Mother Russia through its people!"
 KOM_bukharina_resource_extraction_initiatives_desc: "With our preliminary investments completed, we can now start a serious resource extraction program. Newer infrastructure and improved working methods are a nice start, but in the end they can't change the situation on their own: the state needs to intervene with more subsidies.\n\nBy granting our mines with state funds to buy the latest extraction machines, and directly linking our railroad system to each production facility, we'll increase efficiency across the board, speeding up extraction and cutting the costs. We need everything we can get to save Russia!"
 KOM_bukharina_industrial_farming_methods_desc: "We have already done much for our agricultural sector, but we can do even more. Our Motherland is cold in weather, but warm in maternal instinct: if we want to truly rebuild Russia, we must care for everyone, and providing food is the first and essential step.\n\nTo this end, we shall increase investments into farming machinery, build even more advanced and dedicated infrastructure, and employ the latest technologies in seed selection and intensive farming. By our effort, we shall turn every corner of our land into verdant fields!"
 KOM_bukharina_the_ideal_synthesis_desc: "Finally, our efforts are bringing results. Industrial and agricultural production have increased by several orders of magnitude, and the people thank us for their newly-found prosperity: our lands have been healed from the scars inflicted by war, and we have recovered from our backward methods.\n\nHowever, this isn't enough.\n\nThe Soviet Union we desire does not follow, it leads! We can't be satisfied with copying what others invented, therefore we shall return to the forefront of innovation: our scientists and engineers will work without rest to discover newer and more advanced production methods, so that we may forever be one step aheads of our rivals, both inside and outside Russia!"
 KOM_bukharina_the_soviet_education_system_desc: "One of the greatest changes the Soviet Union brought was free basic education for all. Under the Tsars, peasants weren't allowed to study in order to keep them forever under the nobles' thumb: with education comes innovation, and with innovation comes power!\n\nSadly, twenty years of civil strife and German bombings have destroyed the old education system in both a physical and metaphorical sense. With schools razed to the ground, and children forced to work to feed themselves and their families, learning has become a secondary, or even tertiary concerns.\n\nWe shall no longer tolerate such injustice! Our children need to learn so that they may improve both themselves and Mother Russia: we shall rebuild the old schools, and teach a new generation of young boys and girls the value of culture, and through it, how to be an outstanding Soviet citizen!"
 KOM_bukharina_experimental_curricula_desc: "The traditional teaching methods and subjects are fine for elementary schools. Superior education, however - especially universities - needs to adapt to the new times, or we risk stagnation.\n\nBy introducing new study courses, and experimental curricula, we can revolutionize our education and help our students find what they excel at. Revolutionary minds produce revolutionary ideas, and the Soviet Union is the very embodiment of the concept of revolution!"
 KOM_bukharina_expand_vocational_schools_desc: "Vocational schools teach young students with clear ideas about their future all about a single craft. While entrenched intellectuals consider them somewhat inferior to traditional universities, we are not as blind as them: from their classes come the next generations of artisans, engineers, farmers and bureaucrats, professions upon which lay the very foundation of a country!\n\nWe shall increase foundings to vocational schools, and give those brave boys and girls the best possible education. With it, they will be able to excel, and through it, they will elevate the Soviet Union to new heights of innovation and power: we all serve the Union, and we all deserve the best for it!"
 KOM_bukharina_an_innovative_union_desc: "Gone are the days of decadence and backwardness. Gone are the fields tended by farmers and the factories where workers toiled with obsolete farmers. Gone are the child-workers and the empty classrooms. This is a new Russia, a new Union, where progress, for both the nation and the people, reigns supreme.\n\nWe have done so much, but we still have much more to do. The past is no longer stalking us, and now we are the ones chasing the future: new investments in science and education will send us barreling into a new era of progress!"
 KOM_bukharina_restore_the_red_army_desc: "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following socialist rule coming to the old Komi Republic, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, \"good enough\" simply won't cut it. The enemies of socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the Unification Wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, the Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against fascist tyranny many years ago."
 KOM_bukharina_lessons_from_the_second_patriotic_war_desc: "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the fascists' miraculous recovery."
 KOM_bukharina_study_foreign_strategy_desc: "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 KOM_bukharina_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc: "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 KOM_bukharina_tactical_flexibility_desc: "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 KOM_bukharina_a_modernized_force_desc: "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 KOM_bukharina_the_kazan_military_academy_desc: "Kazan is home to one of nine \"Suvorov Schools\" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 KOM_bukharina_doctrinal_refinement_desc: "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 KOM_bukharina_the_revolutionary_soldier_desc: "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 KOM_bukharina_avtomat_kalashnikova_desc: "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We will begin trials on a new standard battle rifle for the Red Army, deriving from the tried-and-tested design of the AK-47. In time, our troops will hopefully get their hands on a weapon even more effective than the vaunted Kalashnikov."
 KOM_bukharina_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc: "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 KOM_bukharina_the_new_northern_fleet_desc: "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force. The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 KOM_bukharina_the_red_air_force_desc: "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."
 KOM_bukharina_returning_to_the_world_desc: "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 KOM_bukharina_restore_international_trade_desc: "The White Sea now lies open to us, and yet we still have no proper fleet to conduct international trade with. The nature of the arctic waters makes this task more difficult than it would seem. The port of Arkhangelsk is almost entirely frozen over during the winter months, and thus our merchant marine will require a specialized fleet of icebreakers to clear a path through to our trade partners.\n\nAccording to our foreign office, the nations of Scandinavia are already quite receptive to our offers of establishing trade. Due to their close proximity to our ports, they would be a relatively hassle-free journey for our merchant fleets as long as they are able to circumvent the frigid conditions of the White Sea."
 KOM_bukharina_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc: "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 KOM_bukharina_contact_the_OFN_desc: "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 KOM_bukharina_the_gateway_to_europe_desc: "Europe lies under a steel wall of fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 KOM_bukharina_the_swedish_diplomatic_mission_desc: "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 KOM_bukharina_approach_free_norway_desc: "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 KOM_bukharina_an_english_embassy_desc: "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 KOM_bukharina_open_the_rykov_conference_desc: "The Soviet Union was once the bulwark of the global socialist cause, sponsoring their comrades from around the world no matter where they came from. Ever since the collapse, however, this mantle has gone unclaimed for nearly two decades. With a socialist government restored to West Russia, we must regain the initiative.\n\nThe idea has been floated of holding a conference in Rykov in the interest of fostering relations with socialist parties from across the globe and reaffirming our commitment to the international worker. Representatives from hundreds of countries would be invited to attend, and discuss how to proceed with advancing our mutual goals. This conference will hopefully reestablish our government as the preeminent socialist power and a friend to the workers of the world."
 KOM_bukharina_propose_the_socintern_desc: "The Rykov Conference was a good first step to reestablishing solidarity with fellow socialists from around the world, but we can go even farther. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Communist International has been proposed. Like the Internationals that came before it, the ComIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the ComIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"

 KOM_bukharina_the_path_to_liberation_desc: "Despite the odds, we have managed to liberate West Russia and West Siberia! Our people cheer in the streets, for they know that freedom and prosperity is at hand. While we will undoubtedly have to work to ensure that West Siberia is fully integrated into our government, it seems that the sun shines on Bukharina's ideals. We must not falter now, for we must continue onwards towards utopia!"
 KOM_bukharina_the_triumphant_reforms_desc: "While we were able to enact some reforms after the unification of West Russia, there was still much doubt about Bukharina as a leader that prevented her from enacting the full breadth of her plans. With the successful reclamation of West Siberia, many of the doubts about Bukharina have been swept away, allowing her to push onwards. The time has come to begin enacting further reforms to push the people closer into a truly socialist society. These reforms will include ensuring equality for all, investigating the necessity of the familial unit, and ensuring that traditionalism's influence in society is greatly weakened. We shall ensure that the Soviet Union is a utopia for all!"
 KOM_bukharina_the_value_of_equality_desc: "Any socialist will talk about equality. Question them, and they shall go on about the equality of man to woman, of Russian to Indian, and so on. However, what is much rarer is the socialist that backs up said values with actions. All too common is the socialist who will state their belief in gender equality, just to turn around and deprive women of their rights. We must break this cycle by not only espousing the values of equality, but by supporting those who have been wronged by traditionalist culture. No longer will women have to languish because they are supposedly inferior, and no longer will ethnic minorities have to suffer from racism here in Russia!"
 KOM_bukharina_introduce_the_creches_desc: "Family is a complex issue. While familial ties have always been the core of society, the fact remains that many bad traditions and inequalities are passed down through them. In order to rectify this, we have begun an experimental program in which children will be raised communally. This communal raising, called creches, will be the forefront of the experiments on if phasing out contemporary families is possible and feasible. We will keep this program opt-in and small for now, as we are not sure if the creche system is superior to the family system. Socialism is about moving forward, in the end, if the creches succeed, we will be able to move forward from the outdated system of families!"
 KOM_bukharina_a_place_for_the_family_desc: "While the family may have its issues, dissolving the family is more trouble than it's worth, as the cohesion and support it provides to a society is unmatched by communal child-raising. The better option is to promote egalitarian relations within a family. The wife does not have to stay at home, as she has every right to go to work. Furthermore, children, as they grow into adults, are not obligated to listen to the every command of their parents. By promoting egalitarian ideals within the family, we can hopefully break the traditionalist cycles nestled within, allowing for the revolutionary potential of a family to truly shine through."
 KOM_bukharina_strike_down_traditionalism_desc: "In the chaos of the Russian anarchy, the people turned to traditionalism and religion. Now that we have ended warlordism in the west, we have to show the people the trappings of said traditionalism. It may seem beneficial to stick to the ancient truths, but it is those very truths that stagnate society. We shall use the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation in order to help uplift the people to a modern socialist ideal!"
 KOM_bukharina_encourage_experimentalism_desc: "We must encourage experimentalist art amongst our people. For far too long, artists have stuck to the old ways because they are old. While the classics of art may be beautiful, they are not the only way to acquire beauty in art. It is time for the people to broaden their horizons so that they are not bound by the chains of conservative antiquity!"
 KOM_bukharina_foundations_of_the_peoples_society_desc: "It seems that our social reforms have begun to bear fruit. More and more, people treat others with respect, as compared to the contempt they would have before. However, just because our reforms are working, doesn't mean we can merely stop now. We must always keep moving forward so that we can create an ideal socialist society!"
 KOM_bukharina_making_the_peace_desc: "While we have stamped out most organized resistance to our rule, there are still rabble rousers who seek to revolt against our regime and undo our social reforms. We must task the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation to preserve the order, and ensure that we do not become unstable!"
 KOM_bukharina_continue_land_expropriation_desc: "A surprising problem we have run into during our consolidation of West Siberia is the issue of land. Many peasants own a pittance of land at best, while landlords are worryingly common. We must rectify this by distributing all land in West Siberia so that the people have the land they need in order to survive and prosper!"
 KOM_bukharina_the_universal_soviet_desc: "We are all human, in the end. We are all workers, and peasants, and people. There is a certain unity, no matter how much the capitalist says otherwise, that exists between us all. We must show the people the idea of the universal Soviet, that we all work towards a common goal in one grand union!"
 KOM_bukharina_eyes_on_the_unproven_desc: "The various governments of West Siberia have not exactly been pro-socialist. Knowing this, and the conclusion that the people have been inoculated against socialism, we must step up our surveillance efforts against the people of West Siberia to prevent them from revolting against us."
 KOM_bukharina_trust_the_peoples_goodwill_desc: "The people are not their government. Even if the government was reactionary, the people may very well not be the same. We have to ensure that we accept the people of West Siberia, as opposed to treating them with suspicion. After all, it is trust that helps build a better government."
 KOM_bukharina_the_benevolent_state_desc: "More than anything, the state is a critical part of socialist society. It helps provide for the people, and ensure that the freedoms and socialist ideals of the people are upheld. If we must keep a watch on the populace through surveillance to ensure that freedom and socialism is upheld by all, then so be it."
 KOM_bukharina_all_power_to_the_soviets_desc: "We must rearrange the government so that it is governed more on a regional level. This primarily means giving power to the regional Soviets. Of course, while we will let them handle their affairs, we must also keep an eye to ensure that the Soviets do not become controlled by reactionaries."
 KOM_bukharina_a_future_to_be_proud_of_desc: "Now that the vast majority of our reforms have been completed for now, we can march onwards towards reunifying Russia. Furthermore, we can build a future that we can be proud of, where equality truly exists and the people are happy!"

 KOM_zhdanov_unity_in_purpose_desc: "It will be many years before the Paramount Leader's ultimate vision of a spacefaring multispecies collective is fulfilled, but we are closer than ever to that goal. However, before we take our rightful place amongst the stars, we must first deal with earthly matters. Great swathes of our territory are still controlled by a rival government, preventing the industrialization we need to fund our future and denying those under their rule to participate in the grand collective we are assembling.\n\nBut even worse, the Germans have returned their stolen lands to a state of regressive oppression, forcing the people of Moskowien into a stagnant and repressive hierarchy. We must put an end to their misdeeds and incorporate the peoples of that territory into the superculture, and to do that, we must restore our control of Siberia's resources."
 KOM_zhdanov_unity_in_ideology_desc: "To succeed in our goals, Russia must be totally united, not just in geography, but aligned on the principles of the new Soviet state. Achievement of the superculture requires a complete alignment of the citizenry on all fronts, so that we might transcend our earthly bonds. To facilitate the process of cultural conversion we have prepared a new version of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia in line with the principles outlined by the Paramount Leader, to elucidate the values of Ultravisionary Socialism. This will ensure that every citizen is mentally prepared for the creation of an intersolar nation."
 KOM_zhdanov_assess_the_reclaimed_territories_desc: "We are under no illusions about the difficulties inherent in our venture to create a unifying superculture from the disparate masses of humanity. Still, against all odds we have subsumed millions of individuals into our collective, and now possess a great deal of new territory along with all the resources that come with it.\n\nAbove all, the oil fields we have captured will provide us with power, fuel, and funding for our projects. Our tractors, tanks, and soon our rockets shall run on this black gold, propelling our expansion into the lost territories to the east. The remainder shall be sold to fund our scientific projects, serving the interests of the Soviet people. An administrative committee will be created to evaluate the qualities and uses of this and other resources, and ensure maximum efficiency of our efforts."
 KOM_zhdanov_absorb_the_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_desc: "コンスタンティン・ロコソフスキーの支配下において設立されたスヴェルドロフスク設計局は西シベリアにおける最も高度な科学研究機関の一つである。彼は有能ではあったが、超越文化の需要に応えることはできなかった。しかし、彼の創始したこの局は、現代戦やそれに必要な技術を生み出す最前線となった。\n\nロシアの豊かな資源を目的を達成するのにおいて活用するためには、より能率的な実働隊が必要だろう。また、設計局の生み出す利益を最大化するために、施設を拡大する必要がある。"
 KOM_zhdanov_rehabilitate_the_personnel_desc: "Scientific minds are not just highly educated and useful, the men who possess them are highly advanced thinkers and the best suited to lead in the days ahead. Most men do not adapt quickly to the new demands of the day, and our leaders must do it most of all. These men must be fellow architects of the superculture, each doing his part to make humanity transcend its limitations and build a brave new world.\n\nWe have recently acquired several scientists from Sverdlovsk whose experience in military applications of sciences will make fine additions to the collective. Prepare to rehabilitate them as ultravisonary leaders. With their expertise, we shall touch the stars."
 KOM_zhdanov_the_ultravisionary_method_desc: "最高指導者は、そして人類の未来は今、決断の時を迎えた。\n\n我々は真に地上における覇者となり、ゲルマニアの退行主義者を退け、超越文化の建設に携わる数百万の労働者を解放しようとしているのだろうか？二十世紀前半には考えられなかったような技術を生み出し優越を確保し、反動主義者の楽観的な予測、そして我らが科学者の予測でさえも超越することはできるのだろうか？\n\nこの選択は我々の資源の配分を決定する。統一するにあたって、中途半端な決定を下すことはできない。"
 KOM_zhdanov_applied_zhdanovshchina_desc: "Ultravisionary Socialism must establish itself as the dominant and undisputed power upon this terrestrial body before presenting itself to extraterrestrial beings as a superior mode of society. The superculture cannot be challenged by external forces, especially not in a critical moment of first contact with an unknown civilization. It would drastically reduce our credibility to introduce ourselves as merely another of the powers of our divided world.\n\nAs such, we must prepare operations to weaken those who would see us dragged back into the cave of ignorance, secure all the resources we can from them, and manufacture circumstances so as to achieve dominance over the world. As long as the superculture remains vulnerable to Earth-bound influences, stellar adventures will have to wait."
 KOM_zhdanov_the_way_for_humanity_is_open_desc: "Why should a titan meddle with the ants beneath their notice? Germany is divided and weak, a tottering tower on the brink of collapse. Japan is much the same. The West is embroiled in their usual capitalist squabbles. We are above all this petty bickering. The creation and expansion of the superculture should be our concern, above all else.\n\nThis decision will of course have consequences, consequences which are inescapable. Reallocation of our resources to expanding the new frontier will require sacrifices from the Soviet people for the benefit of the whole, as is outlined in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.\n\nThe obsolete governments of the West are bound to the Earth. We are bound for the stars."
 KOM_zhdanov_necessary_material_conditions_desc: "The German invasion has set back our progress by an unacceptable degree, and one of the greatest weaknesses of our new Russia is the living conditions of its people. Infrastructure has been broken apart, cutting our citizens off from networks of guidance created by cities. Farms have been burned and salted, reducing our population's ability to fulfill the most basic of human needs.\n\nThis is an unacceptable state for the Soviet superculture to be in. The individual units of the collective must be functional for it to function at full capacity, and so we must uplift the lowest among us before we can uplift humanity. The broken links between dissolute portions of humanity must be repaired on a physical and psychological level, and we shall never allow ourselves to be divided again!"
 KOM_zhdanov_observe_cultural_shifts_desc: "It is not enough to shape and mold the superculture. The sculptor must monitor his clay, particularly when he works with such materials as the human race, and ensure it is formed and fired properly. Conformity to the principles of the Paramount Leader is to be encouraged, while deviation is to be corrected. Active deviation is to be forcefully corrected.\n\nTo this end, we shall deploy trained architects of the superculture, to monitor every facet of life for the collection of data, obtain feedback on the efficacy of our methods, and detect regressives within our ranks for prompt reeducation. Those who would disrupt the Paramount Leader's plans disrupt the progress of mankind, and shall not be tolerated in any form."
 KOM_zhdanov_society_redefined_desc: "From such small beginnings, we have come so far. With the majority of our enemies defeated, the undisputed control of our lands has been solidified. Our fighting forces grow strong on the back of scientific discovery and innovation. Literature and language is putty in our hands, shaped to our benefit. Our brightest minds construct rockets and discuss the spread of socialism across borders, and between the stars.\n\nAnd beyond the stars, our destiny awaits, to show the universe the power of Ultravisionary Socialism. We shall complete Phase One of Comrade Kardashev's plan for civilization, achieving mastery over our planet, and prove ourselves the heralds of mankind's ascension!\n\nThe superculture shall unite as one, and as one, we go forth."

No amount of fascist violence or particularist deviance can prevent the restoration of the true workers' state. Western Siberia, with its population, industrial hubs and rich agricultural land, is restored to the rightful government of the proletariat. Half of the Motherland is now liberated; we shall begin the process of reintegration and cleaning up the mess that our enemies have made immediately."
 KOM_extend_the_apparatus_desc: "Siberia has been deprived of proper socialist governance for too long. The reactionary juntas, criminals and revisionists have left us with a sorry assortment of ineffective bureaucracies and backwards local administrations. This will not do. The people demand that their Siberian brothers and sisters are granted the full benefits of our renewed socialist society - Comrade Suslov shall see that it is done! Soon, cities and villages alike will be filled with smiling workers and peasants, cheering on the advance of the revolution as it reclaims all of Russia."
 KOM_supervise_the_union_desc: "Siberia is not as refined and orderly as it should be. Crime, banditry and rebellion continue to blight the land. Such is the natural outcome of societal breakdown and the absence of a strong, ideologically consistent government. The workers demand order and security, and General Secretary Suslov will make it so. Police presence in the region will be increased tenfold. Of course, this will in turn require further expansion of our robust security apparatus - a small, harmless reform that the Party is more than happy to endorse. All Siberians shall rest easy under our constant vigilance."
 KOM_the_heart_of_the_revolution_desc: "The workers of the world are all equal, but those of Russia were the first to embrace the revolution in its true form and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. Our comrades around the world have sadly forgotten this fact, owing to our defeat at the hands of fascism - but that was merely a temporary setback. The champion of international socialism is risen once more, strong as ever and buoyed aloft by the spirit of solidarity. Now that we are a global player again, we shall spread the good news to every corner of the Earth. Workers, rejoice - for the revolution has returned!"
 KOM_anti_corruption_initiatives_desc: "Sadly, despite our efforts to eventually become a post-money society, the allure of wealth remains a potent incentive towards criminal behavior. Corruption, that most capitalist of diseases, threatens to become common practice in our bureaucracy. This state of affairs is unacceptable, but conventional methods have proven ineffective against its spread. Perhaps it is time to fight fire with fire? The promise of financial reward to those willing to inform on corrupt colleagues might do more to curb the problem than any amount of investigations or tribunals."
 KOM_expunge_the_secret_societies_desc: "A twin-headed monster lurks, wounded but still alive, in the forests of Siberia. Upon its left shoulder rests the serpentine head of revisionism, hissing falsehoods with a forked tongue and leading workers astray. To its right sits the snarling visage of fascism, muzzle red with the peoples' blood. The beast is the double threat of the Stalinists and the Black League, equally guilty of crimes against socialism, the Motherland and her people. The remnants of these traitors must be expunged from Siberia to make way for sensible, humane socialism, that the wounds of the nation might be bound and healed."
 KOM_a_hand_to_the_khrushchevites_desc: "Even the splitters have splitters. The so-called Stalinists find themselves divided between those loyal to the chauvinist, reactionary Frankensteinian ideas of Kaganovich, and the more orthodox and progressive clique of Khrushchev. The latter still differ from our established Party line to a worrying degree, but perhaps we can return them to the correct path. Lenient, perhaps - but Khrushchev is a charismatic and popular man who commands great respect within the Party, especially from those with more forward-thinking tendencies."
 KOM_increase_socintern_funding_desc: "Russia is a fount of natural resources, giving us significant economic clout on the global stage. We can easily rake in billions from trade, and Comrade Suslov has exactly the right idea for where these righteous profits should be directed: the Communist International. Failure to cooperate with the international proletariat has been the death of many a promising revolution, and we shall not repeat that mistake. The workers of the world will be united, and Soviet rubles will make it happen."
 KOM_repress_potential_deviants_desc: "The rise of another Bukharina or Zhdanov is a possibility we cannot abide. Despite their dedication to socialism, those two splitters frequently endangered the cause with selfish factionalism, setting a dangerous precedent for future generations. The Party cannot allow ideological deviance to become normalized. We must be on the lookout for any potential splitters rising through the ranks, that we might snuff out their ambitions and maintain socialism as Marx and Lenin intended it."
 KOM_accept_the_young_planners_desc: "Though many of the younger generation born after the time of Lenin and Bukharin tend towards unorthodox thought, they are not lost to us. They are like awkward teenagers getting a feel for their pubescent bodies, full of questions and confusion. On occasion, they glean some great insight amidst the chaos of change and become agents of socialism's future development. By vetting their ideas and encouraging growth rather than simply suppressing them outright, we can cultivate the next generation of great socialist thinkers. Someday, the current leaders of the proletariat will be gone; learned, intelligent and innovative successors will be needed to take their place."
 KOM_reform_party_membership_desc: "Membership of the Communist Party should mean something more than what it currently does. As-is, it seems that true believers are outnumbered by career bureaucrats seeking advancement. We are the vanguard of the socialist revolution, not a means by which ambitious men can put themselves above their comrades! Party membership should be accompanied with a set of obligations and standards to strengthen our legitimacy as the representatives of the proletariat. Those who fail to meet expectations will be expelled so that someone more deserving and reliable can take their place."
 KOM_emphasize_anti_imperialism_desc: "Make no mistake; the capitalist West is no friend to the proletariat. Even if fascism is the greater evil, it was capitalism's failings that led to its creation in the first place. That they now quarrel with one another is no concern to us. We know our path and will follow it; it shall never be a lonely one, for we have the workers of all nations by our side. We shall loudly and unequivocally condemn all imperialism, be it born of fascism or capitalism, for ultimately they differ only in their methods."
 KOM_a_strategic_orientation_desc: "We must face facts: the Soviet Union is not in a position to pick a fight with the West. They may be oppressive imperialists, but it was the Germans and their allies who invaded the Motherland and drove us from our homes. One does not look to the distant wolf when the bear is breaking down the door. Though the Americans can never be trusted so long as their corrupt kleptocratic institutions remain, aligning ourselves with the greater cause of defeating fascism is the responsible course of action."
 KOM_the_international_vanguard_desc: "Long have we waited for this day. There are those who said it would never come, that the revolution was finished; what have they to say now? The people and workers of the Soviet Union are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. Fascists, revisionists and reactionaries fall before us like wheat before the scythe! Nothing can defeat the courage and resolve of a united proletariat, mighty and invincible! Today, Siberia; tomorrow, the hills of Manchuria!"

He subtly pressed the button to call his guards into the office. Whoever this man was, he was probably a threat.\n\n\"Oh! I'm the Doctor.

The soviets are the mouthpiece of the people, in their numerous opinions and divisions. Almost every soviet, however, is united in their support of Bukharina.

None of those present needed to know his thoughts. Best they were kept guessing, at least for now. Those he trusted knew his intentions, and that was what mattered.\n\nOn the surface, little was out of place here. The Presidium was gathered for one reason, and one reason only - to determine a path to reunify West Russia. If one did not know better, they might imagine this was the Soviet Union reborn from the ashes; a phoenix resurrected from the corpse of the USSR. If only things were so simple.\n\nBeside him, Shalamov, Shepilov, and Slepkov, the ministers of security, finance, and foreign affairs respectfully, sat. All men he could rely on.\n\nHe could not say the same for the others in the room.\n\nZhdanov, Bukharina, and a few other socialist party members were also seated. While the physical distance between them was minimal, Suslov could sense the clear gulf between one half of the table, and the other. Zhdanov's face was also controlled, though Bukharina seemed almost resigned, though doing her best to hide it.\n\nPretending. That was what all of them were doing. Pretending, while also silently acknowledging the truth at the same time. Already, this brief unity they enjoyed right now was withering away, and it was only a matter of time before this struggle would be decided. It was a pity they could not put their ambitions aside for the greater Union - but Suslov had come to expect such selfishness at this point.\n\nThere was little point in reminiscing on what could have been.

The owner had been kind enough to provide him a spare key, and there were nights when he needed a quiet place to think - and plan. Tonight was one such night. He stirred his tea out of habit, the idle motion a familiar ritual as he pondered the current situation.\n\nThe factionalism that had been present since the ill-fated Komi Republic had not dissipated upon the establishment of the Komi Soviet. Rather, with the opposition destroyed, the fissures had continued to widen. When the democrats and fascists had posed a threat, no one had cause to challenge his direction, for the survival of the Party was before pet theories and orthodox deviations.\n\nWith their enemies gone, the deviants in the Party had grown bolder - and Zhdanov and Bukharina were their faces. Both of them were dangerous in their own right, and their brands of socialism at odds with Party doctrine and Marxist-Leninist theory. They were not interested in a restoration of the socialist state - but rather to experiment with deviant schools of thought.\n\nIt was one thing to privately consider such ideas - it was far less acceptable to spread them, and introduce discord among those who lacked proper socialist education. Unfortunately, others were listening to the deviants.\n\nAnother sip of tea.\n\nBoth would need to be handled, and the direction of the Party stabilized. These were ultimately just bumps on the road. This factionalism perhaps provided an opportunity; a justification to act. Houses divided could not stand, nor could a Union remain strong if enemies weakened her from within."

No, far better to channel history rather than shape it: to block its course with a whisper here, to nudge it with silence there, until the parts have changed so irreversibly that their sum is now uniquely different from what it would have been.\n\nThe slow evolution of history: not particularly Marxist, but agreeably subtle.\n\nThe clique are waiting for him, as they always are: despite his more... stimulating discussions with the rest of the theorists within the Communist Party, he vastly prefers the company of these men and women. Grey-faced, grey-suited, effectively faceless - the very definition of the Party suit. And yet they speak the language of power, Suslov's only tongue, as well as he does.\n\nIt is power now that the clique gathers to speak. Talk is brief and to the point: there have been an anomalous number of intrusions on what could be said - what would surely be said, had the majority been properly guided by its betters - by people who seem less than interested in the Party Line. Indeed, these people seem altogether interested in taking Democracy out of Democratic Centralism, on usurping the Party for their own functions. And who can trust an unknown in these trying times?\n\nSuslov nods. It is time to move past the rhetoric to the only thing that matters. He proposes, in the tones of a bored schoolmaster resolving a playground dispute, a suspension to certain members of the Party, including the close cliques of Bukharina and Zhdanov, and their leaders. A suspension that, of course, will be temporary, and is intended entirely for their own benefit and that of the Body Politic.\n\nSuslov keeps his lips tightly guarded, but he cannot suppress a twitch in his cheek.

He's in the middle of describing the terribly convoluted process when the Party pageboy arrives.\n\nA couple of whispers and Zhdanov excuses himself with an apologetic shrug. As he cosigns the Party documents he asks if the boy's heard anything from Central - that snake Suslov has been suspiciously quiet these couple of weeks, and snakes rarely stay quiet unless they're planning on an expedient dinner. The boy only casts him a confused stare in reply. He sighs and returns the form, slipping the boy a little sugar-sweet from a well-meaning guest. (He doesn't take his tea sweet these days, more's the pity.)\n\nWhen the guests have left, Zhdanov toys with his teacup as he thinks about the guests' political potential. Perhaps they have little on their mind besides the usual concerns of the semi-involved unionists, but with a little training, who knows what they could be capable of? On that optimistic note, he opens the letter.\n\nDisbelief gives way to anger, and then to cold understanding. Zhdanov picks up the phone to call the Party headquarters, but on their end there is nothing, not even a respondent to field calls.

Revolutions, after all, do not wait for the homesick. Even so, Bukharina remains in a distinct mood as she retrieves it from the Party functionary, who salutes stiffly as she cosigns the documentation. She waves it aside, tosses the boy a dollar for his efforts and walks back into her house. The wind is chill tonight - perhaps a little movement of the blinds will be in order. As she enters the room the familiar clang of the ringing phone begins, but upon answering Bukharina hears nothing but dead air. After ten uncomfortable seconds the connection is cut. Confused and worried, she makes a note to dial up Medvedev and the rest to check if harassment against politicians is ongoing. Perhaps a reactionary Passionariyy cell? In any event, she has more pressing matters to deal with than a few agitators. She opens the envelope sealed with Party wax-seal, leafing through the brief dossier. Then there is a cold, cold silence in Syktyvkar, and in her house, and in the heart where dreams of a Red Star once arose. \"It is with regret that I declare you suspended, Svetlana Bukharina.

For over three hours now, they'd been combing through lists of Party officials to determine who was reliable - and who was not.

She'd been allowed to put on some different clothes before being promptly escorted outside.\n\n'Sabotage' was the pretense for this arrest, which she hadn't bothered dignifying with a response. She'd kept stoically silent as she was transported to the jail, when they took her fingerprints, and verified her identity. The processing did not take long, and she was soon moved to her cell. Along the way, she glimpsed Zhdanov in another cell who didn't notice her.\n\nSo it wasn't just her. Suslov was moving against everyone, and it was far too late to stop him.\n\nThe cell door was closed behind her, sealing her fate with a click of the lock. She took one look at her small cell, and ignored the invitation to simply give up. No, she wasn't just going to sit down and allow Suslov's purge to go uncontested. There were others who could step up, but...\n\nAfter this, who would?\n\nThere was a reason she and Zhdanov had been targeted. No matter their differences, they represented different interests, and could rally supporters. Without them, any opposition to Suslov would be token at best. As the minutes ticked by, Bukharina took stock of where she was, what she remembered from being led through the jail, all to plan some means of escape.\n\nShe knew it was likely wasted effort - but should the opportunity arise, she was not going to be unprepared."

And you require assistance to determine a central, incontrovertible Marxist-Leninist doctrine?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Suslov nodded. \"These archives retain a significant amount of knowledge and history. Everything must be considered. COMINTERN documents, Lenin's writings, Stalin's speeches. This will be a long project - but the ideological stability of the Party rests on these answers.\"\n\nSome of the junior apparatchiks were already taking notes, and one gestured to follow. \"I believe I know where we can start, General Secretary.\" Suslov smiled faintly.

I hope the answer is obvious to all of you.\"\n\nHe knew it was - if nothing else, these men understood why it was happening, and on some level, they agreed. \"I don't see that as the issue, General,\" one said after a moment. \"The issue is implementation. I expect that is where the complaints come from. This might cause problems among the soldiers.\"\n\n\"And that is the issue,\" Varennikov said. \"What we have right now are a bunch of poorly-disciplined militiamen we call an army. An army whose soldiers dictate the decisions, not the officers. We require a professional, regimented army that will follow orders and not crack when the first artillery shells land.\"\n\nHe pursed his lips. \"We need to transition to a professional force without delay. As harsh as these measures may seem, they are vastly preferable to the alternatives. Do what you need to, and empower the officers to do the same. We are not a militia. We are not bandits or mercenaries. We are a military.\"\n\nHe looked each of them firmly in the eye as he finished, making sure to emphasize his next words."

 komi_communist_smuta.8.d: "As Zlata was finalizing her latest piece, she realized that she might actually be finished earlier than expected. She'd always been proud of her work - these things came naturally to her, after all - but recently things had been even better than normal.\n\nMuch of her work at the Ministry of Propaganda and Agitation wasn't very interesting, if she was being honest. In theory it was supposed to be about designing creative material for the government.\n\nIn practice most of her time was spent trying to decipher the seemingly indecipherable, trying to wrench some meaning out of the arcane 'artists' guidelines' that were delivered to her desk. She couldn't simply ignore them, either: they needed to be followed and kept, which only made her life more difficult.\n\nBut something had changed in the last few months, and very much for the better. The Ministry was doing a much better job at giving guidelines than before, and now she found most of her time was spent actually doing the work she was meant to do. Her colleagues were also faring better than before, smiling more, and getting more work done.\n\nZlata continued to put the finishing touches on her newest poster. This was arguably her best work yet - a row of workers, chains shattered under their feet, rising up to fight for the Communist cause. It didn't quite feel complete - but one final sentence did it:"

 komi_communist_smuta.9.d: "If you asked her, Zlata would probably have told you that she was good at her job, which was to design posters for the Ministry of Propaganda and Agitation. She usually produced them quickly, allowing the ideas just flowing out of her head - but now she found herself stuck, slightly puzzled by the sheet of paper in front of her.\n\nCurious to see how her colleagues were doing, she took a quick glance around the office, only to find that they seemed just as perplexed as she was. On one hand it was reassuring, the sense that she wasn't the only one struggling. On the other hand, however, how on earth was she going to do this?\n\nAbsent-mindedly she bit her pencil, looking down at the paper again. These new artistic guidelines - underlined three times in a forceful red to emphasize just how important they were to follow - were very different to any of the previous ones she'd received.\n\nFirstly, the entire old art style would have to be thrown into the garbage: it would have to be replaced by one significantly more modernist. This was already challenging enough, but the other guidelines were remarkably particular, like the overlong lists of words they were and weren't allowed to include, the imagery that was to be prioritized, and even the angles they were and weren't allowed to use.\n\nStill, Zlata took great pride in her work and wasn't going to let this defeat her. She decided to look at the slogan - \"A VISION FOR A NEW SOCIETY\" - and begin from there, forcing her hand to sketch. After many hours, an image emerged, a poster that, though different from anything she'd ever done, she could say she was proud of."

But as she entered the frigid office room for this particular meeting, she could sense - just from the sharply dressed young man at the front of the room - that things were about to be different very quickly.\n\n\"Thank you for coming today. I have an order from the minister himself. Let me just say that you will not be returning to your desks this week. Maybe even the next...\"\n\nIt was Tuesday, which meant at least four full days of work. What could they possibly do that was of such importance, especially at such a crucial time?\n\nThe young man held up a map, then pointed at what was seemingly a random area on it. \"This is where you'll be staying for the next few days. It's an unassuming village, nothing special: their main product is wheat. That is perfect for our objective.\"\n\n\"You must spend time with the peasants. You must understand what art appeals to them - and how we can best appeal to them. That is your goal.\"\n\nAs the team was walking to the truck to leave, one of Zlata's colleagues spoke out: \"What could peasants possibly know about art?\""

When he spoke, he effectively presented the direction of the Party. His opinions, such as they were, had outsized weight - and he was curious how this next one would be received. He cleared his throat, and began to speak.\n\n\"Nikolai Bukharin was a Soviet leader who, as with all leaders, deserves comprehensive, and honest scrutiny on his career, life, leadership of the party, and stewardship of the people,\" Suslov started, noting the immediate reactions. \"There can be no denying that Bukharin achieved some notable successes in his tenure, particularly in his Siberian Plan, and his contributions to the Union's industrial sector.\"\n\nHe allowed a pause. \"However, when it comes to the Party itself, his flaws become apparent. While he was able to maintain relative Party democracy, this came at the expense of allowing destructive, deviant elements to fester within, and become entrenched in the Party.he We still bear the consequences of his reluctance to act against such elements today.\"\n\nA few such revisionists went still at that. \"This was not the greatest of his failings,\" Suslov continued. \"He was a man more content to act for the good of himself; for the ideas and plans he believed in. He was a man who put himself before the Union, and in doing so, failed to ensure the security of the Party, and the people to whom their safety was entrusted.\"\n\nNow for a strong closing statement. \"Bukharin's tenure must be considered with these facts in mind. We must be objective, and recognize the precidents set which were beneficial to the Party, state, and people - and which ones failed. Where he failed, there must be no hesitation to condemn such decisions - for if we do not condemn now, then we are sure to repeat them.\""

His legacy, for reasons I have yet to understand, appears to be under debate. So now, I want to make it clear exactly the 'legacy' Bukharin has, and settle this once and for all before the Presidium.\"\n\n\"I will remind this body,\" Zhdanov continued. \"That failure is endemic throughout Bukharin's tenure. He failed to stand up to the bourgeois interests. He failed to listen to his advisors. He failed to heed the wisdom of the Communist International. He failed to lead, and because of his failure, the collapse of the Soviet Union can be laid at his feet.\"\n\nZhdanov's lips curled into a dismissive sneer. \"With such a legacy, why would any of us delude ourselves into acknowledging or praising what few non-disastrous decisions he made? It was under Bukharin that Russia collapsed. It was under Bukharin that our brightest were ignored. It was under Bukharin that socialism became a twisted, perverse, and regressive belief.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"This is Bukharin's legacy - a legacy that must be recognized and condemned in the strongest possible terms. His brand of socialism must similarly be condemned, and buried forever. We have experienced the results of Bukharinism - to do anything less than to view it with revulsion risks such elements ruining us once again.\""

Bukharin was an especially controversial figure, and despite her relation to him, she was determined to give an honest assessment of both his virtues - and failings. If that made her more enemies, then so be it.\n\n\"Nikolai Bukharin is a man who generates strong opinions,\" she began. \"I am no different, but from what I have heard, it appears that emotion and opportunism are clouding the judgement of some members. We must be honest about who men like Bukharin were - regardless of our personal biases.\"\n\n\"While some may have forgotten, Bukharin held many strong, correct socialist views in the early days of the Soviet Union,\" she continued. \" It is fair to ask then - what changed?\" She let that question linger before continuing. \"One reason that his policy positions evolved is because of valid fears about the ability of our state to develop - but that was only one reason.\"\n\nShe paused again. \"Intentions do not excuse his poor decisions regarding the NEP which allowed the corporate classes to oppress the proletariat - but this can also be traced to the increasingly corrupt institutions of the Soviet Union, and the actions of the Party to excise the proletariat from decision-making. Bukharin, rather than fight this corruption, instead let it corrupt him, and therefore, his ideals that he once held.\"\n\n\"We must not forget,\" she concluded. \"That Bukharin, while his role was extensive, was hardly the only man responsible for our collapse. To blame him for the fall of the Union is to ignore the decisions and actions of others who contributed to the downfall of the state - and risks us ignoring important lessons. When Bukharin is considered, we must consider the whole picture, and not fixate solely on the man himself. Only then, can we objectively assess his legacy.\""

Their reactions would tell much.\n\n\"Justice is something that must be undertaken with the utmost care,\" Suslov began. \"The integrity of the Party must be similarly treated with utmost seriousness - however, when decisions must be taken as to one's place, and loyalty to the Party, each case must be treated carefully. A leader who expels those who challenge him in good faith does not act in the interests of the Party - but in the interests of himself.\"\n\nShifting in seats, eyes unblinking, he had their attention. \"Let us not understate what this is. It is tyranny. It is the actions of a despot; one who cares only for sycophantic praise, or merely fears honest critique of his actions. There are serious concerns that such motivations prompted the removal of many loyal members of the Party, as the Soviet Union fell.\"\n\nHe listed off some names. \"Zinoviev. Kamenev. Stalin. All men whose contributions to the Party, and service in the Great Patriotic War, cannot be understated. Each of them were removed at the behest of then-General Secretary Bukharin.\" Some of the Presidium were whispering to each other now. \"In light of the concerns raised concerning Bukharin's tenure,\" Suslov stated. \"The Party will conduct a thorough review of those who were expelled, and assess if their expulsion was justified - or merely political.\"\n\n\"At this time, I recommend to the Presidium that Joseph Stalin be restored to his previous standing, and his contributions to socialism once more considered among this body,\" he concluded. \"As Marxist-Leninists, we cannot be united until past injustices have been rectified.

The sound of music was replaced with static, and Zhandov was now live on the air. \"Good afternoon my fellow citizens. This is comrade Zhandov here to report the latest news from the Supreme Soviet. After much recent debate, we have decided to restore the names of those who were removed under Bukharin's tenure.\"\n\nZhdanov shifted in the chair before continuing to the next part. \"I know for some this might be difficult news, but it is true. The fight to restore the union requires unity, and the mistakes of our predecessors are acknowledged.

Rather than assess, support, and nurture the proletariat across the world, the Soviet leaders instead elected to make socialism only possible in Russia. It was to make socialism inherently Russian, purportedly for the purposes of ensuring the revolution's survival.\"\n\n\"This shortsighted approach resulted in the collapse of the international communist movement,\" Bukharina stated. \"And in doing so, doomed the Soviet Union, who had no support outside our immediate sphere of influence. Those who protested this destructive policy were unjustly expelled - and today they have been vindicated.\"\n\nShe looked out at those seated in the Presidium. \"This injustice will be corrected, and these leftist internationalists unjustly purged from the Party should be restored.

Here and there what appeared to be the angular form of planes - rockets, perhaps? - arose from the scintillating mist around them, nestled in the ocean of red font like Venus of Botticelli.\n\nAnd at the bottom of it all a slogan: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW WITH TODAY'S SOCIALISM - FOLLOW THE VISIONARY LINE.\n\nEvanoff sniffed. They'd have to do better if they wanted to impress the headmaster of the Kotlas School for Young Artists. Dipping a sponge into her bucket of water, she began to scrub the amateurish enthusiasm away. Perhaps their next work would be more inspired, or at least less excessive in its use of outlines.\n\nThe next week the propaganda was back, bolder and more garish than ever. The arsonist, whoever they were, had evidently reacted by doubling down. Bolder and crazier the red mist foamed in every corner. New symbols of progress, arrows reaching ever upwards, lifted atop a sea of crimson arms and hands holding hammers. Above them all, a rocket bearing the spindly wheels of the atom rose like Jupiter into shaded red sun-rays.\n\nThe slogan had at least been shortened. ZHDANOV TODAY - THE STARS TOMORROW!\n\nMs Evanoff stared and stared, and then she began to giggle. It was so bold, it was almost endearing.

This was certainly something to be triumphant about - Were there not a few asterisks attached.\n\nShe was not naive as to the circumstances surrounding this development - a good portion of those who had removed Suslov and backed her were not supporters of her vision for the nation. This was a political calculation - one where they likely believed that she would be easier to control, manipulate, or intimidate than Suslov had been.\n\nThey likely had that impression because she was a woman.

No doubt the ROA had utilized the Kuybyshev command bunker at some point, though if they had, it didn't seem to have been for very long.\n\nIt had been a long time since he'd set foot in this building. He remembered what it was, of course. Everyone knew of this contingency, that if Moscow fell, the Red Army leadership was to retreat to Kuybyshev. An event that seemed so long ago now, another life, another era. The scale of what had been lost was...\n\nDifficult to comprehend, even now.\n\nSuslov idly walked into one of the rooms, and took a seat at one of the desks. His reminiscence turned to a mild irritation as he saw the ROA emblem on a plaque, resting on the desk. Pursing his lips, he picked up the distasteful object, and tossed it into a nearby trash can. Fascist, collaborator filth. That there were such men who called themselves Russians brought no small amount of shame - and anger.\n\nUnfortunately, they were far from the only ones. While the number of outright collaborators were not many, the unfortunate truth was that many such groups, traitors, and dissidents had risen to prominence in the fall of the USSR. It was to say nothing of deviant socialists practicing abominations of socialist thought elsewhere. He took off his glasses, setting them on the desk, pinching the bridge of his nose.\n\nRestoring the Soviet Union was a task that would require a degree of work which he was only now beginning to truly comprehend. It was a process that would take years, if not longer. Today was only one step of a long, hard journey. Yet if such steps were necessary, then it would be done."

 komi_communist_smuta.27.t: "A Symbol of Magnificence"
 komi_communist_smuta.27.d: "It had been far too long since he'd been at a proper tank factory, so long that he'd forgotten what it was like. Standing in one once more, Zhdanov found himself in awe at the sheer size, production capability, and industrial power on display. And this was in its diminished state! Imagine what it could do when it was fully restored!\n\nThe factory foreman seemed taken off-guard by his enthusiasm, but seemed thrilled that someone was actually interested in the work he was doing here. Zhdanov peppered him with questions and compliments alike as they toured the factory, concluding with a drive in one of the tanks fresh off the line.\n\nShepilov, who he'd insisted come along this tour, seemed to be far more tempered in his excitement, even politely refusing the ride in the tank. When the tank drive was done, Zhdanov returned to him with a wide smile. \"You sure you don't want to take a ride?\"\n\nShepilov managed a smile. \"I don't think so, not today.\"\n\n\"Your loss,\" Zhdanov sighed contentedly as he looked upon the small tank fleet that had been assembled. \"Magnificent, aren't they.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Shepilov said. \"With a few more facilities like this, we would have the capability to rapidly reclaim much of the USSR. I would estimate even to the east of the Urals.\"\n\nThat was what he wanted to hear. \"That will be the first order of business,\" Zhdanov determined. \"We will need to restore this one to full capability - and after that, we built a dozen more just like it.\" Shepilov didn't feel like it was prudent to explain how much investment that would require, not when Zhdanov was so excited. So for now, he decided it best to agree. Besides, the sentiment wasn't wrong."
 komi_communist_smuta.27.a: "\"That sounds like an admirable plan.\""
 komi_communist_smuta.28.t: "Nature's Symbols"
 komi_communist_smuta.28.d: "While she would not admit it to the people who lived here, Bukharina did not like Vologda. It was wet, cold, and all-around miserable, especially this time of year. The only reason she was here was because she insisted on personally meeting with representatives of a peasant commune that had liberated themselves once they'd heard the Red Army was approaching.\n\nThey were wonderful people, and she was glad she'd made the trip here, and looked forward to integrating them into the Soviet state. However, it didn't make the weather any better. During a break in the talks, she'd decided to take a short walk in the nearby woods.\n\nThere'd been a battle that had taken place here in the West Russian War, and she wanted to see the aftermath for herself. In the years following the war, much of the battlefield had been looted or overgrown - but remnants still remained.\n\nShells of tank chassis. Old, broken rifles. The occasional metal sheet, tank barrel, or shrapnel. There was more than she'd expected, even if much of it was buried or hidden behind brush, snow, or dirt. She approached a stream, and paused as she saw what rested within it - or beside it.\n\nAn old tank turret rested where the stream was, though now the water flowed around it. She could see that it hadn't always been the case. It was likely that the turret had blocked the original path of the steam. Then, as time had passed, the stream had gradually made a new way around the obstacle until it was as if the blockage hadn't been there at all.\n\nThere was something about noticing that which made her pause and contemplate. The only noises were the sounds of animals, and the trickle of the stream. She stared at the turret for a long time, before deciding it was time to return."
 komi_communist_smuta.28.a: "She turned away, and returned to the village."
