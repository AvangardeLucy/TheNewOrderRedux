He served under Prado as Minister of Development and Public Works, where he disagreed with Prado's policy of playing both sides during WW2. Postwar, he worked in the Agrarian National Society until Prado's return to Peru in 1956. As keeping the door open for Japan lost Prado support from the landowners, Moreyra convinced him to join the ACDN, and became Prado's second vice President. After Beltrán criticized Prado's government, Moreyra mediated, and Beltrán became Minister of Economics and President of the Council of Ministers, or Premier. Following Beltrán's resignation, Moreyra took over as Premier, and remains a close friend of Prado.§!"

 POLITICS_MANUEL_PRADO_UGARTECHE_DESC: "1889年に元大統領マヌエル・イグナシオ・プラドの息子として裕福な家庭に生まれたマヌエル・プラド・ウガルテチェは民間のエンジニアであったが1940、50年台を通してペルー政界の大物になっていった人物である。地位があがるに従って彼は時の大統領であるオスカル・R・ベナビデスに後継者として認められるようになり、そして1939年の選挙に勝利した。プラドは非合法組織APRAとPCPの弾圧というベナビデスの方針を踏襲した。ナチがポーランドへ侵攻するとプラド政権は外交政策方針を一転させる。真珠湾攻撃の後はアメリカと連合国を公式に支持すると表明しワシントンと良好な関係を維持したが、一方で日本との対話も続けていた。1944年になってもまだ戦争の趨勢は定まらなかったが、アメリカが強力な国であったことに変わりはない。したがってプラドは「当然の」外交政策を続け、ついに真珠湾がまばゆい一撃の下に消滅しアメリカが枢軸国に降伏した運命の日が来た。\n\n北の巨人が倒れた様に衝撃を受けたマヌエル・プラドはそれでも正しい選択をしたと納得し、何もかもがそれまで通りに戻ると考えていた。彼の任期も終わりに近づく中で彼はペルーをアメリカとカナダに託した。彼はその後祖国が混乱に陥り、うわべだけの日常に戻ったのを遠くから見つめていた。彼が1956年と1957年の選挙に戻ったのは自然なことだっただろうが、大衆の支持なしでは選挙活動はできない。彼の盟友はベルトランとの同盟である国家保守民主主義同盟（ACDN）を形成しオドリアと協力するよう勧めた。運命的なモンテリーコ協定は封印され、プラドはACDNの候補として選挙に勝利し、そして見返りにオドリアの腐敗は隠蔽された。二期目に際してプラドは国家保安法を提出しAPRAとURの非合法化を続けながらも組織の穏健な構成員を釈放した。また彼はペドロ・ベルトランと協力し経済の安定化に成功した。\n\nプラドが大統領になってから5年が経つがやらねばならないことはまだ山ほど残っている。選挙が近づき、ACDNでの派閥争いの激化や投資戦争、APRAの脅威が迫る中、プラドは執務室を離れる前の最後の一手のため準備をしている。伝統的な戦術を彼は未だとり続けている。全てが通常に戻るまで何もしないことだ。前回はうまくいった。今回もうまくいくはずだ。§Rそうだろう？§!"

 PRU_idea_two_super_powers_one_economy: "二つの超大国、一つの経済"
 PRU_idea_two_super_powers_one_economy_desc: "Since the signing of the Akagi Accords and Prado opening up the economy to Japanese investment, there has been an economic investment war between America and Japan in Peru. Peru, in many political theorists' eyes, can be Japan's entry point into South America; accordingly, both nations have been heavily investing in Peru to achieve their objectives.\n\nInvestment from both the Rising Sun and the American Eagle was courted by various Presidents of Peru throughout the 50s, with President Odría attracting millions of yen of investment into Peru from Japan. American investment remains strong however as they are unwilling to let a single nation drift into Japan's sphere without a fight.\n\nThere are frequent American-Japanese economic clashes, especially in the Northwestern Industrial and Oil Refinery zones in Talara. If Peru can continue courting investment from both superpowers, they can expect riches to flow into the country. However with riches comes problems: inequality has risen with rich Japanese and American families taking large swaths of wealth from this investment and becoming as rich as Peru's upper class. While Peru is benefiting economically, there is a backlash amidst the working class of Peru which, if not dealt with effectively, could result in a return of violence in Peru."

 POLITICS_FERNANDO_BELAUNDE_TERRY_DESC: "Born in Lima on October 7th 1912, Fernando Belaunde, more commonly known as Architect Belaunde by his followers and the Peruvian press, is at once both your typical Peruvian Politician and something out of the box and complete. Born to a very prominent aristocratic family with a long line that goes back to Lima's first Spanish inhabitants and with two times Peruvian Prime Minister Rafael Belaunde as his father, Belaunde had a comfortable and promising youth.\n\nAfter studying in the United States, Belaunde would come back to lima and become a rich impresario and extremely famous for his academic and architectural works. Through his father's connections, he would serve many political appointments, which he would only need to abandon during the time of Odria's regime. He would get involved in politics by founding the National Front of the Democratic Youth, a group of young reform-minded activist which launched his candidacy in 1956 against Manuel Prado. After achieving 2nd place in that election, he would transform the NFDY into a full-fledged political party, Accion Popular (AP). Based on his ideas of Peru as a Doctrine, he would visit and create AP arty cells in every Peruvian city he visited, and he visited them all. Which would make him the most well-known and vocal opponent of the Prado Administration.\n\nNow after achieving what he couldn't in 1956, Architect Belaunde has a long job ahead of him. Many plans are about to be set in motion but if he has the political finesse that his predecessors didn't only time shall tell."
 POLITICS_LUIS_BEDOYA_REYES_DESC: "Born on February 20th, 1919 in the Peruvian port city of Callao, Luis Fernan Bedoya Reyes had a humble yet prominent upbringing. From a very young age, he was known as an intelligent and prodigious man, which would lead to him graduating with top marks at San Marcos University, the oldest higher education institution in the Americas. He would then conduct a promising career as a lawyer.\n\nInspired by the ideals of Christian Democracy since his student years, he would be one of the very first members of Peru's Christian Democratic party (PDC). Due to the PDCs coalition with Belaunde's Accion Popular in the 1963 election, he would be named as Minister of Justice by the Belaunde Administration. Due to his distinguished ministerial tenure, he would be made the Belaunde-backed candidate in the Lima Mayoral elections of 1964. Where he would defeat the popular Ex-First Lady of Peru, Maria Delgado de Odria, by a sizeable margin. In his administration, he would be known as the most productive Mayor in Lima's history, where he would earn the country's admiration for his achieving massive results without any links to corruption and bribery. After becoming disillusioned with both Belaunde and the PDC, he would create his own Political party, the Peoples Christian Party (PPC), a Party that would be able to lead the country to its needed reforms while also being true to the ideals of Christian Social Doctrine.\n\nNow he has achieved what many could and yet could not have predicted at the same time. He has indeed climbed to the top of the greasy pole, Peru's Presidency. By perhaps a stroke of luck or a benign twist of fate in times when the world's democracies lie endangered, Peru may have been landed with the best person to build up its own democracy into longevity. It will be a wonder if the Andean country can keep its lucky streak."
 POLITICS_MANUEL_ARTURO_ODRIA_DESC: "Manuel Arturo Odria is nothing if not a very typical kind of political figure in Latin America, for better or for worse. Born 26 November 1896 in the Peruvian province of Tarma to a family of renowned military tradition. This would inspire him to join the Army from a very young age, where he was distinguished amongst his peers as an intelligent and disciplined soldier. This would lead to his steady rise in the army ranks to the point of becoming one of the Generals in the Peruvian High Command during the First war with Ecuador.\n\nIn 1947 he would become Minister of War for the administration of President Jose Bustamante y Rivero after an APRA terrorist attack. After Bustamente refused to make APRA an illegal organization again Odria alongside the rest of the Peruvian Armed Forces would depose him in a coup in October of 1948. After a completely fair election in 1950, Odria would be legitimized as Peru's President. His administration would be characterized by popular Infrastructure Programs, such as Peru's national stadium, and the expansion of Peru's national insurance program. It was also characterized by the persecution of APRA and very violent repression of its militants. Forced by both internal and external forces, those being of the OFN and the United States, to re-democratize the country in 1956, Odria would pass the presidency to the eventual winner of that year's election Manuel Prado Ugarteche, with whom he had previously agreed that he would peacefully step down in exchange that Prado would not investigate the many corruption allegations against him.\n\nNow after Peru's civilian political class failed once again, Odria has returned to the presidency and the job he started on the revolution of 48 shall be finished, whether the Yanks like it or not!"
