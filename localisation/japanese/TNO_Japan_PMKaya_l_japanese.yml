 JAP_rub_our_back_desc:0 "予想通り、岸と椎名の両氏は支援の見返りとして、それぞれの条件を持っていた。改革派の官僚や圏内の経済拠点にコネクションを持つ経済官僚など、岸にとっては見え隠れする人脈を持つ人物を、政府内で起用するよう要請してきた。\n\nこれらの人事に加えて、特に満洲国の問題や、帝国や共栄圏の他の市場との関係で、商務省の支援と強化が岸に約束されているのである。\n\n彼らの支援の代償は大きい。しかし、我々が成功したいのであれば、これは払うべき代償であろう。"

 JAP_and_we_will_rub_yours_desc:0 "岸も椎名も、革新官僚に便宜を図るなら、それなりの期待があることはよく承知している。いくつかの重要な政策について、彼らの支持を求めることになる。\n\n具体的には、内閣企画官室の改革だ。\n\n賀屋の政権を成功させるためには、内閣府の権限と責任を改革し、賀屋のビジョンを達成するための力をつけなければならない。しかし賀屋一人では、このような努力は成功しないことは分かっている。しかし、革新官僚や商務省の支援があれば、その可能性は大きく広がる。\n\n岸と椎名の力量が試されることになる。"
 JAP_a_new_face:0 "新顔"
 JAP_a_new_face_desc:0 "外務大臣には、岸、椎名両氏から意外な候補が挙がった。それは広東の前首席行政官であり、大東亜省の著名な大臣である鈴木貞一氏であった。\n\n安田危機とそれに続く広東での経済の大暴落で不祥事を起こし、辞任した鈴木である。外交とは関係ないとはいえ、より安全な選択肢がある以上、賀屋は彼が適切な選択であるかどうかわからない。\n\nしかし、他の人物を選ぶと革新官僚の機嫌を損ね、せっかくの同盟関係も台無しになりかねない。しかし、慎重に選ばなければならない。"

 JAP_standing_tall:0 "断固たる態度"
 JAP_standing_tall_desc:0 "予想通り、この内閣の決定は、岸首相とその一派を中心に、国会で多くの眉をひそめ、嘲笑を浴びせた。しかし、政治というものは、万人を喜ばせることを目的にしてはいけないし、無益な運動に耽ってはいけない。しかし、運は気まぐれな女主人で、与えるだけでなく、奪うこともでき、無敵の信念のために合理性を放棄する。次のステップは非常に慎重でなければならない。木戸と国会議員に、我が国の伝統的な権力の柱を保持することを保証しなければならないからだ。\n\nもちろん、どの程度のことをするのかは、今後の議論次第であるが、旭日が30年前のように輝きだしたら、結局のところ、あまり議論にならないだろう。"

 JAP_pragmatism_reigns_supreme_desc:0 "妥協の技は信じられないほど繊細であり、これは新内閣誕生後に証明された主張である。妥協の産物である内閣になることは間違いないが、首相は自信を持っている。\n\n官僚であれ省庁であれ、賀屋は実用主義の限界を克服し、我が道を歩むだろう。"
 JAP_begin_the_reforms:0 "改革開始"
 JAP_begin_the_reforms_desc:0 "首相は、経済成長が主に国家によって推進されなければならないという強い信念を持っている。しかし、彼の自信とは裏腹に、彼の信念は他の権力者たちから広く支持されているわけではない。1930年代の経済政策に回帰するために、政府を団結させるために、説得の多くが必要であることは避けられない。\n\n今はまだ暫定的な段階に過ぎないが、これからの飛躍を期待する。"
 JAP_intergrate_the_military:0 "軍の統合"
 JAP_intergrate_the_military_desc:0 "残念なことに、軍は手強い獣のままだ。彼らは政府と協力することを学ぶべきだが、他方では現状破壊を恐れて完全に治めることはできない。\n\n従って、上級司令官は政府がいかなる脅威に対しても強靭で強固であると思わせるような政策で誘惑する必要がある。そこから着実な変革の流れが、軍を我々の統制下に置くことにつながるだろう。"

 JAP_prepare_our_tools_desc:0 "No man would charge into battle without ammunition - and so too in the world of policy can we not be left bereft of knowledge. The tools in our battle with the opposition in the Diet are statistics, reams and reams of printed facts and figures pulled from the depths of the Finance and Commerce Ministries' archives to prove our point: that we are the only ones who can do best by the Empire. We will support new think tanks and policy research with generous budget allocations; anyone that dares to challenge us will be found sorely wanting for an argument to prove their point."
 JAP_start_digging:0 "採掘の開始"
 JAP_start_digging_desc:0 "By the nature of our constitution, our Army and Navy have a privileged voice in politics, at times both a benefit and a nuisance. But no organization's attention span is infinite and all-encompassing. In the years since the end of the Greater East Asian War, the military has had to minister to the safety and the prosperity of the Sphere at large - and reaping handsome profits in the process. A few more mining licenses in Korea surely would do no harm - to them, and to our own aims in Tokyo."
 JAP_by_any_means:0 "あらゆる手段で"
 JAP_by_any_means_desc:0 "The Cabinet Planning Board, by virtue of lacking competition, has significant powers to direct the functions of the economy at a whim. But whim is a precious and intangible thing, and to base the authority of our programs solely around it is hardly a sustainable solution. We must enshrine the primacy of the Cabinet Planning Board - with our men at its head - in national policymaking in law, so that none can question the provenance of its decisions. The Diet will surely see reason."

On closer inspection, we see the several problems menacing Japan, from the daily tussles within our own economy, to the intense staredown between our armed forces. As we've pledged before, we shall solve these issues, one way or another."
 JAP_a_new_economy:0 "新経済"
 JAP_a_new_economy_desc:0 "The proposed plan describes the preferential funding for the \"New Zaibatsu\" in a striking clause - one that has drawn the attention of many in the Diet. It draws attention to conglomerates making swift profits in the industries, such as Mangyō in Manchukuo; their rise to prominence in the region has seized the minds, and greed, of many in Japan. Moreover, Nichitsu and other chemical intensive firms are believed to have climbed up to the bill's attention.\n\nHigh-tech heavy industry, industrial chemical production, and electrical hardware corporations are rising to prominence in the new Japanese economy - we rob ourselves of economic successes to come by not securing them a place in the future of Japanese development. These industries will be the prime order of the new system we construct in the future of the Empire."
 JAP_trick_the_zaibatsu:0 "財閥を騙す"
 JAP_trick_the_zaibatsu_desc:0 "As we inaugurate sweeping change across the national economy, we must be careful not to scare capital away from the Home Isles - lest we wrestle with the anxiety of Zaibatsu in the future, costing us greatly. As such, we will offer soft words and amicable assurances to those in authority of both Mitsui and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu, but nothing more. Our speech must dance the line between kind warning and half-truths.\n\nAlthough we will not show the same mercy to Sumitomo, we hold the seat of government at the end of the day. The Zaibatsu should be thankful we would be so kind as to coordinate with them in our efforts to reorganize the Japanese economy. Cooperation, on our terms and on our terms alone, is most acceptable."
 JAP_patience_is_a_virtue:0 "忍耐は美徳なり"
 JAP_patience_is_a_virtue_desc:0 "They say time is the most valuable thing a man can spend, and with enough patience, any truth will rear its head eventually. The Kaya government has had a similar revelation; there exists a trail of paper crumbs implicating the Zaibatsu Mitsui and Mitsubishi in accounts of corruption and money laundering. It is only a matter of time before the two trip over their own feet, and leave themselves exposed to incriminating charges.\n\nRather than pounce now, It is best we stay still and watch for them to leave behind enough evidence to pull them up in their shady dealings with the Navy and those in Takagi's camp. With the thread left open and left to unravel, the Zaibatsu and their pawns are bound to ensnare themselves in the corrupt web of connections they have spun for so long beneath our noses."
 JAP_break_their_backs:0 "背骨を折る"
 JAP_break_their_backs_desc:0 "The Zaibatsu have always had a significant presence felt in the Japanese political arena; their dominance in the economy is felt in the Diet, across prefectures, and throughout the Empire. However, despite their usefulness, it is imperative they do not challenge the government in governing the country. In recent years, some Zaibatsu have grown greedy and unruly, even fattening themselves in moments of government neglect and growing in influence without moderation.\n\nThus, there is no other option but to cut out their tongues and pockets, and it is only acceptable that this government holds the knife. Mitsui and Mistubishi's influence in the political economy, stretching from realms of economic domination of entire regions to preferential administrative treatment, and their raspy voices in the Diet, must be cut down from where they are seated."
 JAP_reignite_the_rivalries:0 "ライバル関係の再燃"
 JAP_reignite_the_rivalries_desc:0 "With our crosshairs lining up to target Mitsui and Mistubishi's rapacious influence across the political economy, our efforts to double-down and draw power from the Zaibatsu must consider their efforts to collaborate. Both facing government crack-downs, there is a chance, although slim, that they make to scurry and defend themselves in collaboration.\n\nIndeed, they share a mutual interest in resisting attacks on their economic dominance and perfidious influence over the Japanese political machine. Thus, it is of paramount interest that disagreements, bickering, and strife arise between the two, so that we may eliminate any interest in corporate partnership. It may require that we invest in the use of inappropriate means to do so, but the line must be drawn. After all, when the gavel is struck, it will be the corrupt businessmen who will face the hate."
 JAP_the_gambit:0 "初手"
 JAP_the_gambit_desc:0 "The oft-praised 'Free Hand' of liberal markets have time and time again proved too fragile to rule the Empire's future; beneath the bickering mess of diverging corporate interests, the prosperity of the nation struggles to breathe. It is time we leap to radical solutions, lest we suffer the same fate of those who were unable to subjugate greed to the very livelihood of the Kokutai.\n\nRaising many eyebrows, state-seizure and eminent domain will be our chosen method of hacking away at their influence. By exploiting reignited rivalries across the board, Mitsubishi and Mitsui cannot resist government measures to exert control over their fought-over shares in the heat of their petty quarrels with each other. It is only right we initiate our sweeping tackle against their gross incompetence."
 JAP_economic_consolidation:0 "経済の強化"
 JAP_economic_consolidation_desc:0 "The wheel of fortune turns, and with it the future of the Japanese economy pivots its attention to new skin in the game. The \"New\" Zaibatsu, some of our ministers as well as economic professors have taken to calling Nichitsu, has risen in the halls of economic growth and hiking profits, and has thus caught the attention of our government as a new partner in our efforts to reorganize the economy.\n\nLet us invite representatives from Nichitsu to a formal meeting with our government. It is in their best interests, and in the best interests of our government, to collaborate and coordinate on the production of heavy industrial chemicals. The development of a robust and well-staffed military industry, rich in natural and developed resources, is of the utmost importance if Japan is to last as a superpower on the international chessboard."
 JAP_a_new_order:0 "新秩序"
 JAP_a_new_order_desc:0 "With ink fresh on the co-authored bills, and rounds of applause circulating the National Diet, we initiate our culling of the battered and bickering Zaibatsu. As we sink our teeth into their inflated budgets and poorly-allocated resource heaps, it is important to reflect upon the duty taken upon our shoulders, and uttered from the lips of every minister of our government - \"Peace in Asia\"\n\nReorganizing the machine that has fueled and powered the Empire of Japan for decades is more than simply an oiling; sleepless nights and corporate warfare have gnawed at the very life of our administration over the Empire, but with each legislative success we march closer to the refinement of the national economy. The light at the end of the tunnel glimmers daintily; a Japan triumphant against shortage, wasteful competition, and corruption is within an arm's reach."

 JAP_economy_for_the_state_desc:0 "The final stretch arrives, wherein the blades we have sharpened can be buried in the Achilles of Mitsubishi and Mitsui once and for all. For too long have their finances clung to members of the Diet, passing millions between clammy hands and slimy smiles. Japan can no longer stomach their corruption, and so they will be cut down from where they have enjoyed their position of power for so many years.\n\nOur bill presented to the Diet will set plans in motion to gut the working efficiency of both Zaibatsu to compete with their rivals, and thus their subordination to the agenda of the current government will soon follow. It is a bold measure, some would claim, but it is one that meets the crimes of both Mitsubishi and Mitsui in ferocity, in order to tackle their corrosion of the dignity of the Japanese political system."

The future demands Japan is supported by her regimented, coordinated, and cooperative economy; there is no time for inefficiency or exploitable weakness.

However, our armored corps are sorely lacking compared to that of our German and American rivals - even the long-dead Soviet Union had better designs than us before its destruction. If we are to remain a competitive force in our fight to defend Asia and the Co-Prosperity Sphere from the skulking American menace, the perfidious influence of the madmen in Germania, or seditious radicals from Manila to Mukden, we are left with no other alternative.

Like a divine wind, our airmen were able to strike a given target with an inferno of firepower, and withdraw in good order to organize once more.\n\nLet us build upon this tradition of excellence in design and training, utilizing the greatest minds in military engineering and theory, so that we may construct an air force the world shall fear. Our enemies from Urumqi to Utsunomiya will flee and scatter, covering their heads and ears upon sight of our jet-engine weapons of war hunting from the skies - none shall evade the aquiline precision of the Empire's air forces."

If this peace is to remain, we must work harder, smarter, and more efficiently. Every and all military formations on land, in the air, and in the seas must be supplied with every munition they will ever need.

The former shook his hand, and the latter smilied, gesturing towards a seat. A seat a little too low for Kaya's preference.\n\n\"I need your help, gentlemen,\" Kaya said. \"You two have proven yourselves efficient bureaucrats time and time again, which we have dire need of. I would appreciate it if both of you were to publicly, and privately, support my new cabinet. Your reputation would give my cabinet a certain legitimacy that it currently does not have.\" Kaya straightened his back, even as both men smiled and nodded.

I had it in mind to revive a few retired agencies and ministries,\" Kaya replied. \"They were powerful institutions that boosted our nation to the spot of a global superpower. I thought both of you could lend a hand in reconstructing these agencies and ministries, controlling them after the fact.\"\n\n\"That would suit us wonderfully.\" Shiina said, a broad smile across his face.

The Prime Minister sipped at his water, wondering which schmoe would stand up next to frustrate his plans.\n\nShiina Etsusaburo, it would seem. \"The Cabinet Planning Board aches for reform,\" he began. \"Our practices of the past are just that: of the past. Old ways are nothing more than obstacles for progress, and the people that defend them only a little less so. I say yes to these reforms, and so, I am sure, do many of my colleagues.\"\n\nShiina smilied, and looked to the Prime Minister. \"My only question is when Minister Kaya might get out of our way, and finally allow the rest of us a little work for a change.\" The comment elicited the laughs of his aligned Reform Bureaucrats.\n\nIt seemed Shiina's show of support was as much of a shock to the rest of the Yokusankai as it was to Kaya. Murmurs and whispers flowed all throughout the assembled politicians, which exploded into loud displeasure as Kishi Nobusuke stood, agreeing with Shiina's points and voicing his approval for the reform. If those dimwits in the Yokusankai didn't clue into Kaya's deal, they certainly would've now.\n\n\"56 to 44!\" The vote counter called out in a bellowing voice. \"The Cabinet Planning Board has passed!\" The man's voice was answered by applause from Kaya's side and utter bewilderment by the opposition.

The man was a political outcast ever since his failure in Guangdong. He did not hold an enviable position, managing that chaotic little nation. Perhaps there was something to the man after all.\n\n\"Suzuki Teiichi.\" Kishi smilied. \"Less likely people have held the Foreign Ministry before, you know.\"\n\n\"Who has?\"\n\nKishi smiled again, then frowned. \"Well, I can't remember their names off the top of my head... But I'm sure there were one or two.\"\n\n\"Suzuki could fit the role.\" Kaya thought. His failure in Guangdong was a domestic issue, not an international one, yet assigning him a minister could attract a fair bit of negative attention anyhow. Arita Hachiro would not have that effect, but his appointment could risk the relationship Kaya had only just formed with the two men in front of him. He had to be decisive, though.

He could see an issue with Kishi Nobusuke coming down the line, but as long as he kept the man happy, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\"We have already made incredible progress, especially with help from our friend Mr. Kishi Nobusuke. Now is the time to capitalize on our work, take the initiative, so to speak. We shall press forwards with a new direction, and I myself already have a thought in mind. To advance our nation, the military must be enshrined and made great.\"\n\nHis cabinet sat silent, nodding along, smilies on each and every one of their faces. They, at least, understood. The innovationists and bureaucrats seemed less keen, but that could be worked over with time. \"I must say, Mr. Prime Minister, that I could not put it any better than yourself.

The Prime Minister's old bones were aching, his hands nearly shaking. Administration was proving difficult.\n\nIt was six by the time the meeting concluded with a final thought from Kaya.

This party cannot remain divided. The disasters of the past have proven this fact to us, and each level of our government is somewhat responsible for this division.'\n\n'What is best for Japan, what is best for its survival, is the preservation of the Kokutai.

Neither Takagi's clique nor the status-quo politicians within the Yokusankai decided to raise, although Kaya hadn't expected them to. It was his own clique and the Reform Bureaucrats he needed. With grunts of disdain, they, to a man, raised their hands.

When they quietened, he allowed his voice to level. \"From yesterday to the Taishō era, this has been an issue. The factionalism, the backstabbing, the asslicking. Yet, we can manage this.

He had told the minister to keep an eye out for the press' reception of the government's new agenda. The front page headline 'Kaya Okinori: A Guiding Light to the Future' informed the Prime Minister that this reception had been a positive one. Littered throughout the paper were more encouraging headlines and articles, all showing a genuine interest and cautious hope for Kaya's newly made government.

That was true self belief: the belief in your own competency.\n\nKaya was the Prime Minister of Japan. All doubts must be expelled. He was entrusted by the Emperor himself to lead his nation. He would not fail now.\n\nThe Diet had assembled slowly today, and even now, the chambers echoed with idle chatter. Kaya's voice quietened their murmurs, the chamber speaker officially calling the session. All eyes turned to Kaya, burning into him. This is leadership, he told himself. This was the burden of ruling, and he would not succumb to it.\n\n\"My colleagues. My cabinet and I have crafted a plan for prosperity. Some of you amongst us have aided us in doing so, whereas some of you have only hindered us. That does not matter now.

How much easier things would be, if he could throw caution to the wind! He'd been chosen as Prime Minister; did he not have the right to determine policy as he wished? And Kishi's hardliners were more than dependable in a legislative scrap, even if they asked a high price for their services.\n\nBut politics was the art of the possible, and right now, it was impossible to see a way out without the YSK's other factions. The technocrats would not survive long without either the public cover provided by the conservatives, or the aristocratic networks of the Kidoites.\n\nThe last thing Japan needed, Kaya mused, was for the YSK to be consumed by infighting, when it needed stable leadership most of all. Even if it meant forcing the hardliners - most notably Kishi Nobusuke and his protege, Shiina Etsusaburo - to accept minor cabinet positions as a peace offering.\n\nSo be it.

 japkaya_tree_one.19.desc: "\"My esteemed colleagues. I am Prime Minister Kaya Okinori. Today I stand here to announce the government's position in response to the Yasuda Crisis.\n\nAs we revisit the past mistakes made by the Tōjō and Ino Cabinets, and the current situation we are in, we must all ask ourselves one important question - where did we go wrong? Indeed, there were technical mistakes in that we failed to handle the financial situation, yet that does not account for the full picture. Why was there resistance everywhere when we tried to call upon the people to buy bonds and make savings? Why were our posters and fliers in the streets torn down and spit at by the people, and no matter how many arrests we made, the unrest kept burning red and hot? Why did the people lose faith in us?\n\nInvoking my experience as a civil servant and a politician, it became clear that we have forgotten the very purpose of politics. Our constituents cast their votes on us. We feed on the taxation paid by our fellow subjects of His Majesty. His Majesty entrusted this glorious Empire and its people to us. And as such, we bear the responsibility and the honor to lead the people, to care for the people, and to solidify the loyalty to His Majesty in the hearts of the people. Blind suppression of the people was in deviation from His Majesty and the people's expectation; how good is a father if he knows nothing but beating his child? How can we solidify people's love of His Majesty, and the trust in the government, if we turn a deaf ear to their voices, and decline to teach them the righteous way?\n\nToday, here in the holy halls of the Imperial Diet, I solemnly vow that the past ways of absolute control over the masses will come to an end. This cabinet will devote itself to guiding and aiding the people, while serving its proud duty as the guardian of righteous values. Thank you.\""

 japkaya_tree_one.20.desc: "\"To summarize,\" Kaya concluded. \"You may draw your unfavorable comparisons to the policies of the war and of the Tōjō years. You may find these procedures unnecessarily repressive for a peacetime society and a peacetime economy. You may consider these the lingering obsessions of an aging wartime cabinet member forcing the solutions of the past on the problems of today. I expect to hear these complaints frequently in future Diet sessions, in fact.'\n\n'But know this. We are no longer living in an age where such appeals to emotion or to ideals will suffice to deal with the problems Japan faces. Our issues will not be solved by instituting arbitrary levels of economic freedom or social permissiveness. They will not be solved by politicians invoking the Emperor's name in the cause of pedantry or their own special interests. They will not be solved through political theatre.'\n\n'Our issues will be solved through utilising our constitutionally-granted power to guide Japan in the right direction. They will be solved by forcing our institutions, by hook or by crook, to work in the national interest. They will be solved because they will be regarded as problems to be solved, rather than issues of contention between the ambitious and greedy. Though this may not sound pleasant to many sitting here, it is necessary. And if you value Japan in your hearts as much as your oaths would imply, you will do what is necessary to see Japan through.\"\n\nKaya looked around the room. The liberals were silent, as could be predicted, while the technocrats were almost howling with applause, Kishi almost bouncing in his seat. The conservatives clapped, as politely and uselessly as always. Entirely expected outcomes. Despite what the movies said, grand speeches were never enough to truly sway opinion."

 japkaya_tree_one.21.desc: "The military was an odd beast, thought Kaya. One with two heads and orders of magnitude more internal cliques and contradictions. A supremely important and necessary pillar of national strength, yet a corrupt financial drain, constantly spending more time at each others' throats than at the enemy's. Something which needs to be brought to heel, for its own sake and for that of the nation, but one which would almost rather destroy itself than submit to oversight.\n\nKaya supposed part of it owed to the traditional views of military officials towards civilian administration. Never mind that Kaya himself had managed to bankroll their great crusade across the Pacific in the thirties and forties, nor the need to budget and finance armies in general. To generals and admirals the world over, men like Kaya were little more than pencil-necked bureaucrats standing in the way of their great ambitions, or skewed visions of necessity. But the truth of it all - one that the smarter military men recognised - was that they needed each other. Kaya was far from too proud to admit it. The armed forces were the only institutions capable of mustering the strength to deter the threats from outside, and disciplining the threats from within. But for them to understand this, a bone would have to be thrown.\n\nFortunately, the generals liked to consider themselves men of force and action, exactly what they would soon be required to deliver. They would need funding for this. Thus, to give them what they wanted was a matter of simply directing them to where they were needed. A few tense evenings and a few misunderstandings cleared, and this could be set in motion. Perhaps even Takagi could be brought on board."

 japkaya_tree_one.22.desc: "It had not taken long for disagreements to ring out over the Prime Minister's dinner table. One slightly pickled general was holding a fork into the air like a spear, glaring daggers at the men around him. \"Politicians treat fronts and armies like they treat cars, to be adored for a time, and then thrown away when a new, shinier model comes by, regardless of utility and spirit,\" he continued. \"The Kwantung Army has been steadily ignored for decades now, while Tokyo gawks southward. Don't let the fatcats in Hsinking fool you: the partisans are very much still active, and Russia's growing less chaotic by the day. When they come for Urajio, how long will it take your men to march from Shonan-to?\"\n\n\"It was my understanding that the Kwangtung Army was supposed to hand over responsibilities to this highly competent and motivated Manchurian Imperial Army I keep hearing about for years now,\" countered another, with puffy red cheeks and a tortured, mangled pile of seafood below him. \"We don't have the time or money for your speculations or paranoia. You won in the north. Savour your victory. Down south, meanwhile, we still have real wars to fight, and a real job to do.\"\n\n\"Why you-\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, please!\" Glaring heads whipped round towards Kaya, smiling serenely. \"The failures and indiscretions of previous administrations may have caused you to forget that we have the economy of a superpower behind us, one which promises to only grow further still as we put it towards a healthier direction. Nobody will be left behind, and we are more than prepared to meet each of your needs.\""

He had half expected them to conduct their own little mock exercise over his table, with knives and fish heads in place of bullets and shrapnel. The IJN, it seemed, were content to leave such brutish behavior to the open seas, if it existed at all.\n\nTheir requests were simple, and could easily be granted. More funding, of course, that much was obvious. Key bases would be strongly reinforced and key shipping routes protected more vigorously. Resources would be allocated to help build the maritime forces of Japan's loyal allies in Southeast Asia. The future would be accounted for in equal measure with the present: new naval technologies, grants for the study of tactics, increased observation on the changing nature of ocean warfare around the world, all would be keenly considered. Nothing would be forgotten, no stone left unturned. A comprehensive, full package, for Japan's brave defenders on the waters.\n\nJust then, Takagi slowly rose to stand, making Kaya's heart skip a beat. Pleasant or no, the admirals were deeply connected to the YSK liberals, and so a man like Takagi's opinion counted as double here. Would this be enough, to cooperate on at least this one issue?\n\n\"As we all well know,\" Takagi began, \"me and the Prime Minister disagree on a wide variety of issues, and I expect we will continue to do so in the future. However, I must admit I find myself impressed with his proposed plan for the Navy. Whatever misgivings we may have then, I would like to express my admiration for what we see before us now.\""

It was all printed right up on the great map of Asia in his office. Slowly, but surely, the marks representing the activities of various consulates, development agencies, joint projects with Cultural Affairs in various nations, all were drying up. What they were being replaced with instead was garrisons, attachés, joint training camps, naval bases, things of that sort. From Kwantung to Kuala Lumpur, civilian authorities were fading into the background, and as various jurisdictional scuffles were sorted, the Army and the Navy were moving in. Shunichi looked around his cozy little office, and wondered if it would be so cosy this time next year.\n\nFar away, in a much grander, less cozy office, [GetJapHoG] turned to Kaya. \"The ministries are growing less than pleased, you know. Every day, more mail comes in, going on about overreach, or abuse of power, or the 'complete impossibility' of working together productively with whatever branch of the armed forces are encroaching on their perches. If things continue this way, we may have a serious problem.\"\n\nKaya's expression remained blank. \"We always knew something of this sort would occur. Fear of poking the hornet's nest is what lead to our current predicament. We can no longer afford such placations. The integration goes ahead as planned.\""

The numbers didn't lie. Efficiency was improving across the board, the military presence was finally driving some much needed discipline into civilian administration, and the armed forces themselves were finally beginning to be equipped and act as soldiers of Japan, rather than a mass of brutes with firearms. Japan's institutions, at last, were learning to put aside their feeble, pointless squabbles, and move ahead in a unified direction. Things could soon be set right, and the future could mean something once more.\n\nThe economy could grow again, unlocking all kinds of new possibilities. Asia would be secure once more. Be the threat from armies, partisans, corruption, rot, natural disaster or nuclear hellfire, the Sphere would stand ready. Ready, together and united, Japan would finally be able to stand as the noble vanguard of the Pan-Asian cause, enveloping the East in mutual cooperation and technical proficiency. And in doing so, their enemies would tremble.\n\nKaya, for his part, felt a little like trembling at that very moment. His doctor would surely say that now was no hour for a man of his age to work, Prime Minister or no. But Kaya knew that this was foolish, when one considered all the work yet to do. His body and mind ached in equal measure, yes, but they also burned with the satisfaction of a job well done."

As it piled up more and more, it would threaten to turn to blight, creating a rot so deep only complete destruction and rebuilding would suffice to make Japan whole again.\n\nBut they had not made it to that stage yet, and Kaya would not let it happen. He still lived, he still breathed, the fire remained within, and most importantly, he was still Prime Minister. The worms had not escaped his attention, and they would not escape his wrath.

Ino was by far the most corrupt official of their generation, and if they wanted to show they were serious about removing the corruption in the government, they had to start with his cronies. \"Easy to justify to the public,\" one of the officials said.\n\nHe was correct.

Stepping forward, the triumph in his stride noticeable absent, the gentleman squeezed from his section of the room, moving with abstract purpose toward the doors which swung outward into the halls of the grandiose Diet building that he believed would house his greatest success to date.

His visage lay sorrowful, and yet a determined glare burned behind the glaze of his muted pupils.

Please, before you weep my departure from the tangible world, heed my words and take a moment to think about it as I have always asked you to. Since the passing of the act, 23 professors at our university have been removed from their position. Needless to say, their views were incompatible with the path of our administration. They did nothing but follow the pursuit of academic freedom. Yet, their acts out of intellectual curiosity and justice for the masses earned them cold, unforgiving fists from the Home Ministry.\n\nA friend of mine and maybe yours, Professor Kouyama Iwao, was one of those who lost their tenure. He was the sole breadwinner of his family and a firm believer of Asian Co-Prosperity through equality and fraternity between nations. Yet, not only did he lose his job, he also received a hefty fine from Tokkō for \"unpatriotic acts\". In what world would a just, kind man like him suffer like this? In what world could a man be punished just for siding with good? In what world would calling for fraternity between peoples of Asia be a crime? While there is little I can do in the tangible world, I hereby leave my worldly inheritance to his family, and I sincerely plead to you all to assist innocent scholars like him if it isn't a burden.\n\nAs a humble student of Zen Buddhism, I know well enough that ending my life prematurely is in no agreement with Buddha's teaching, and I strongly advise you against pursuing my path. I believe, however, that my death can be of benefit to you as a message and a plea to our government.

His family was strapped for money as it was; after his father had sobbed upon coming home one day after being fired from his factory job, all eyes - his parents' and his siblings' - had silently turned to Hiroshi, as the eldest son, to become the breadwinner for the household.\n\nHe had no qualms with working, but it seemed the employers had qualms with him. Unemployment in his city - and indeed the rest of Japan - had shot up in recent years, no doubt due to the Yasuda Crisis his father always muttered about at the dinner table. The few businesses which still put up hiring notices had all turned him down. Unless anything changed, he might soon have to go begging. As he turned the corner, he saw a man, huddled in an alleyway with a cup for change and a thin blanket. That might - would - be him before long, if nothing changed.\n\nThe House of Representatives had devolved into mayhem as soon as the Speaker had announced that the nays had defeated the ayes. Every deputy - reformist, conservative, technocrat, aristocrat - was at each other's head, passing blame for the failure of the economic recovery bill like a grenade with its pin pulled. Kaya, dejected and disappointed, slinked out of the chamber before the bomb could be passed to him.\n\nOn his way out, another deputy intercepted the Prime Minister, inviting him to dinner with his clique of conservatives.

He drank moderately and never gambled. He even watched his brother's kids! Yet, it wasn't enough. No matter how hard he and his wife worked in the fields, no matter how much they harvested, his landlord always took every coin from his pocket. And whenever Oda trekked up to the landlord's big house to complain about his broken tools and the lack of seeds, the man had the gall to complain about the government. It wasn't him stealing Oda's money and doing little in return, the landlord whined in his fine clothing, but the government. Then he cried about some bill and the Diet and reminded Oda he was behind on his rent.\n\nThere were days when Oda and his wife Hina wondered if life could have been better. Maybe, they muttered while eating rice, they could have moved to Manchuria while they still had the chance. Maybe they could have ignored the stories about bandits and poor soil and made a life for themselves as the first settlers of a new territory. Whatever the hardships, at least it would be without bastard landlords.\n\nBut those were just dreams. He did not live in a world where he could stop being a tenant farmer. He lived in one of constant toil, interrupted only by regular visits from the local policeman. The visits seemed to be more frequent month after month. Perhaps, it was a sign of worry, an expression of fear by a government that could not help its people, that could not make basic changes to help people like him.\n\nWhatever the reason, Oda said nothing as the officers rooted through his small house without asking.

He had heard of and seen for himself the phenomenon of towns, cities, and entire prefectures being left behind to languish in economic stagnation as industries failed and fled the region, leaving the area to be a shadow of its former self.

A lesson of why party politics inexorably leads to incompetence and failure, of why Japan needs the guiding hand of the state - of the bureaucracy - to function perfectly.\n\nYet, in a painfully ironic twist, the House of Representatives has blocked Kaya's and the New Bureaucrats' Light Industrial Development Bill. The squabbling factions of the Yokusankai - little better than the Minseitō and Seiyūkai of the interwar period - have cited reasons ranging from fiscal concerns to lack of support for larger corporations for voting against the bill. They are myopic fools, seeing not the bigger picture of the urgent need for our recovery program at any cost, blinded by ignorance at best and corruption at worst.\n\nRegardless of our grievances with the Diet, the bill's failure is more or less final.

 japkaya_tree_two.28.desc:0 "MINISTER OF FINANCE FUKUDA: The Corporate Stabilization Act may appear to be throwing good money after bad. We are fully aware of the general public's suspicions towards the Zaibatsu after Yasuda's collapse. But having witnessed the damage of said collapse, it is of utmost importance that the flow of money in the economy - and confidence - be restored as soon as possible.\n\nIn exchange for state funds, the government has secured agreements with Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo that they will promote the development of the Empire's economy as dictated by government policy. And may I remind you that this government's priority is to ensure the fruits of economic growth are now spread tangibly to the Empire's subjects: in roads, in power plants, in schools and in hospitals.\n\nThis is the only way that public trust in our system of governance, which has served us since before the war, will be maintained...\n\nTAKAGI SŌKICHI, MP: I ask the government: how is this any different from the state-directed economic planning that created a conduit of graft leading up to the Prime Minister's Office? A lighter touch, the Minister says; to me, this looks like half-measures.\n\nSHIINA ETSUSABURO, MP: How does the Minister expect the people to trust in our leadership by rewarding those who defrauded them? Our priority must be to punish those who subvert the needs of the state and the people for selfish gain, and to reorient the economy once again towards a common goal: the advancement and prosperity of our Empire."

She'd been threatening to take the children back to the countryside -\n\n\"Get out of the way!

He opened his mouth to shout back - who the hell do you think you are - but the man had already hurried away, yelling at a beleaguered secretary further down the hall.\n\nThe scene was no less hectic in his office, with the space occupied by a cadre of unfamiliar men haughtily haranguing his subordinates, reducing them to running errands. Kameda's deputy scurried over with an apologetic bow.\n\n\"Ministry of Finance audit, sir. The government's demanding a full accounting of our operations, if they're going to bail us out -\"\n\nKameda pushed past the man, his footsteps hastening as he approached his desk.

It had liberated the western colonies in Southeast Asia, it fought alongside Indian freedom fighters in Burma, Assam, and Bengal. It oversaw the conquest of China, Japan's ancient rival. A glorious institution; the pride of the nation. At least, that was the view of an outsider looking in.\n\nTo Ogawa Teijiro, the Army looked like an unfunded relic of the past.\n\nThe barracks he was summoned into was barely functional, looking as if it dated back to the 20s. A layer of rust had gathered underneath every metallic object in the assembly hall, and a small family of tanuki had settled in the upper floor. One of the dog racoons, in fact, sat atop the highest floor, looking on as the milling group talking amongst themselves.\n\n\"Recruits!\" A booming voice called out to the crowd of assembled conscripts as the doors opened, with finely dressed soldiers beckoning them inside. \"Boots!\" One called out. \"Utensils!\" Another said. \"Study equipment!\" \"Clothing!\"\n\nWhat a shambling wreck - why did they decide I have to serve in this shit stain, Ogawa thought, while waiting in line for his boots. \"No no, I'm size 25.5, these are too small,\" he said when it was his turn, except the man that had handed him the two pieces of black leather was already talking to another recruit. He almost got a word out in complaint, but one of the uniformed soldiers had already pushed him aside.\n\nAs Ogawa walked back into the main hall, he heard the shrill call of the tanuki. He looked up, seeing those two black-brown eyes looking straight back at him. It made another squeak, a long squeak that went up and then down, and then up and down again. He was laughing at him, the bastard."

Somehow, Ogawa fancied that those tanuki were still laughing at them all. Ogawa chucked the bowl aside. \"Let them have it,\" he muttered.\n\nIt was barely ten minutes later that they were told to strap on all of their equipment. Ogawa wore his helmet, a backpack full of gear, and those boots he still hadn't gotten replaced. When the recruits made it to the course line, each man was given a mock rifle, seemingly weighing as much as an actual firearm. Then, the company was set to marching.\n\nThe march was long and hard, up and down the hills of the northern Japanese countryside. It had been raining the night before, and his fucking boots had a hole in them, saturating his socks. He'd have to find a way to get rid of them, lest his toes freeze.\n\n\"Hold up! We'll rest for food. We're turning around in ten minutes!\" At the call, Ogawa pulled another man aside, almost as breathless as he was.\n\n\"Kane, do you have a spare pair of boots? These ones are fucking killing me! I would've rather strapped two garbage bags to my feet.\"\n\n\"No, sorry. The officers ordered the equipment from some shady manufacturer.\" Kane whispered. \"They did it so they could pocket the rest of the money for themselves. At least, that's what the others told me. Eat up, we've gotta leave soon.\"\n\nIt wasn't long until the march resumed. With his soaking feet and his sore stomach, Ogawa trudged off behind the rest of the company."

If only those dreams hadn't been sucked out of his mind by his miserable experience at their training camp, he might've just taken veteran Kane Miyazaki at his word.\n\n\"The Navy had shipped us just east of the port. The Australians hadn't yet been alerted to our arrival, but the Papuans on the island told them soon enough. A gunfight had broken out along the New Bismarck hill line, and artillery pieces had already begun shelling our positions...\"\n\nMiyazaki kept the room silent, yet Ogawa couldn't help but be disinterested. There was no glory left for him, or anybody else in the room. There was barely any half decent food to be found in the whole barracks. Where the fuck would he find time to win a battle, or earn a promotion?\n\n\"...yet the rest of the battalion had yet to arrive along the shoreline. The captain called it in, and suddenly we had the Australians trapped between us and an allied battalion. We made short work of them then.\" The man grinned a toothy grin as the rest of Ogawa's class applauded him. It pained him to clap along. An ancient tale for ancient men, he thought.

Except for those fucking... pieces of underwear. I swear, my genitals have actually shrunk during my time here.\" He groaned, and grinned at Ogawa. \"But I have finally been liberated. My genitals can roam free once again.\"\n\nOgawa had to admit: the new boots felt good. He could feel all five toes, and he could wriggle them one by one. The socks were not the scratchy pieces of fabric he had become so accustomed to, but soft pieces of wool that actually comforted his feet from the boots, rather than adding to the misery of Ogawa's old shitty boots.\n\n\"Marching practice.\" Kane groaned. Ogawa could hear the siren too. But perhaps with the new boots it would not be so bad. \"Come on, let's go. We don't want to keep Officer Hayao waiting.\"\n\nThe march went well. Very well. Ogawa led the group of jogging men down the course, smiling all the way. Each step felt like justice. Justice for his poor, purple, abused toes. When the men sat down for a break, the food was not pig slop, but carefully prepared pork and rice, topped with soy sauce, and all of it came in large proportions. And for once, it was warm.\n\nBreak ended with Ogawa leading the marching group again. He joined in with a smile as the men sung their way down the marching course.

Seeing the flag in surprise and feeling a sense of weird warmness, Kayaba stepped into the bridge and made his way to the officer's dining room.\n\nThe moment Kayaba stepped in, he was welcomed by a firm handshake from Captain Sakyo, commander of the Yakumo. \"I'm so glad you came,\" beamed Sakyo, \"here, try this curry. Our ship just won the fleet's curry-making contest; even Admiral Takagi loved our curry!\"\n\nOverwhelmed by the friendliness of the captain, Kayaba nodded and had a spoonful of Yakumo's pride. Damn, this is the best curry I've ever had, Kayaba thought, but he decided to keep his reserved posture in front of the captain. Those guys are from the rival service, after all. \"Thank you for this delicacy, Captain Sakyo,\" Kayaba responded, \"and what would be the reason that you invited me here today?\"\n\nSakyo replied with a smile. \"Colonel, I have noticed that the protein supply of your men is running low, so I'd like to ask if you'd permit us to share some of the beef and fish on our ship. I have consulted my officers and my men, and they all agreed to abstain from meat once in a while if it means helping their brothers-in-arms.\"\n\nKayaba was shook by surprise. What he heard was not what he had expected. Ever since that interservice cooperation bill got passed, he had heard the tensions were easing up between the Army and the Navy, yet he clearly did not see himself witnessing this nearly impossible change. He thanked the captain and accepted the offer, consumed his meal silently, and headed to the door as he finished, before being stopped by the Captain and handed a piece of paper--\n\n\"Colonel, take this curry recipe before you go...\""

If all went well, it would be a simple trip. No issues, no drama.\n\nKaya hoped so, anyway. He was concerned that there would be some unexpected disaster, intentional or otherwise, that would derail this. However, there had been no indications of it, and so he allowed himself to breathe.\n\nEverything would be fine.\n\nIn the grand scheme of the long and bitter rivalry and competitiveness between the military branches, this was a small, almost miniscule event that was taking place. It was a single step, one on a long, long road to repairing the divisions that had only worsened since the Second World War.\n\nBut a step nonetheless.\n\nWith increased spending across the board, and his own efforts to help foster a more cooperative environment, Kaya believed that they were already, slowly, starting to bear some fruit. He was under no illusions as to the time and investment it would take. It would be years, if not decades, and he was aware that it might even persist beyond his own lifetime.\n\nHowever, that did not bother him overmuch. He was secure in the knowledge that his efforts had laid the groundwork for a more stable, secure, and prosperous Japan."

The Diet had been a constant cyclone of scandal and crisis, making and breaking political careers in the blink of an eye. It was tough to survive. But Kon had survived it all. Because Kon was careful, and Kon was prudent.\n\nIn the days of Tōjō and the height of the national defence state, Kon had sung the praises of the military and the Manchurian lobby, at a measured, even pace. Never too quiet, never too loud. And when the YSK decided that Tōjō's hour had passed, Kon quietly but noticeably accepted a necessary change in direction, and all those which had followed. His constituencies got the money and projects they needed, and Kon continued to quietly do his job, cordial to all, but enemy nor ally to none. He was careful to never seek higher office. The benefits of a cabinet position were like those of amphetamines, a short, sharp rise, followed by a sudden, irreversible drop. Better a stable and placid position. If all Japanese politicians felt the same, the country would be a better, more honest place.\n\nOf course, it took far more effort to be prudent than most people realised. Kon made a point of avoiding factions wherever possible, but on some days, the floor of the Diet became that of a casino, one where only betting customers could remain. Today was one of those. The old technocrats and the new, both alike in dignity, were butting heads for the future of the YSK. One had prime ministerial support, the other formed from some of the oldest bulwarks the party knew. A difficult choice. Kon would have to be prudent. But, in this case, what was prudence?\n\nJust as he was mulling this over, a group of prominent peers walked into the Representative's Chamber, voicing support for the Prime Minister. Kon shrugged."

I doubt any representative wishes for this stalemate to continue. Hence, I have sought counsel from our sister chamber. They were so kind, in fact, to bring me a letter and signatures. I would like to read it, if the House pleases it.\"\n\nKishi did not allow time for the House to respond before he began. \"It is the express opinion of this group of peers that the proposed ministerial restructuring by the Prime Minister is not in the interests of Japan nor His Majesty. It is highly unlikely that such legislation would achieve its supposed aims of improving efficiency and tackling corruption, and is instead a transparent attack against the Prime Minister's political opponents.

One that was summed up in his closing sentence: \"It's time for us to step back.\"\n\nOver the past half hour, he'd changed the conversation to one that was reflective; introspective. Both of them were of a similar age; each of them had grown up in the same period. They'd experienced Japan when she was at its height, they had watched the Empire become a world power. They held the power of nations. Theirs was a perspective that few others could dream of.\n\nAnd both of them were old. Japan was entering into a new era now, and in a sense, they were relics. The world around them was changing in ways none of them could have imagined when they were boys, or even men.\n\nKishi had surprised him partway through, speaking a little on his own. His eyes had been unfocused while he'd spoken, as if speaking to himself. On some level, what he was saying resonated with Kishi. They were both old men, and their time was coming to an end.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" Kishi mused, almost to himself. \"I do not think I will... fully let go, as you seem to wish. This is where I belong, but perhaps it is time for the younger men to enter and prove themselves.\" A thin, humorless smile crossed his face. \"It is perhaps best if they learn not to rely on us.\"\n\n\"We have shaped the world, both of us,\" Kaya said. \"Few can say that. We have earned the right to rest, and the men behind us earn the right to make mistakes - and learn from them.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Kishi admitted. \"I have my doubts about the man you wish to replace you, but perhaps he deserves a chance.\" Kaya nodded, and with those words, knew then that he had won."

A presentation that revolved around the corruption of Takagi's lieutenants, and Mitsubishi, who were involved in an elaborate plot to seize Yasuda, which Takagi was at least partially aware of. Much of the evidence seemed legitimate and damning, yet Kaya found himself almost... disappointed.\n\nHe didn't bother to hide his apathy. \"Is this supposed to be shocking, Nagayama? Insider trading, corruption, deals in the backrooms, why are you attempting to portray this as an anomaly. We are not children here.\" Kaya's eyes flicked to Kishi, who had largely been silent. \"It is rich that you are attempting to tie Takagi to this, when we know your own vast connections to Korea and Manchukuo, Kishi. I trust that we are not going to pretend you have clean hands when it comes to the corporations?\"\n\n\"All the same, we are talking about Takagi now,\" Nagayama insisted. \"This cannot go unanswered.\"\n\n\"No.\" Kaya shook his head. \"If you wish to pursue this another way, then so be it. But I will not drag them before a committee.\"\n\nKishi appraised him carefully, then nodded to Nagayama. \"Show him.\"\n\nWordlessly, Nagayama handed Kaya another folder of documents. \"Perhaps this will make you reconsider.\"\n\nWith some trepidation, Kaya opened the folder, and inside it were detailed reports, meeting minutes, and irrefutable evidence that showed an old Zaibatsu-backed plan to remove him from power. The implication could not be clearer - he would either follow Kishi and Nagayama's plan - or he would be deposed."

Corruption in Japan was well-known, but corporate coups against the government were a red line - and at least publicly, were unprecedented. Aoki was the first to speak. \"With all due respect, Prime Minister - what proof do you have of such a conspiracy? That is a serious charge.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Kaya said. \"And I did not come without proof.\"\n\nFor the next half hour, Kaya went through each piece of evidence with Aoki and the Board. Some pieces were stronger than others, but when it was all put together, even the most skeptical would be hard-pressed to deny that there was a vast conspiracy afoot. The evidence did generate some debate - but the argument against it did not last long. \"This is unacceptable,\" one of the Board finally stateded. \"This must be dealt with.\"\n\n\"It must,\" Aoki agreed. \"The only path forward is the Diet.\"\n\nThere was some debate over that, but most - Kaya included - ultimately agreed with the proposal. Only legislation, enforceable by law, would be enough to restrain the corporations. Their power had been unchecked for too long, and now it would be dealt with. For the next four hours, the Board, Kaya, and Aoki worked to craft the legislation that, if successful, would restrict the power of the corporations far beyond anything that had come before."

They were here to arrest him.\n\nAnother knock. Harder this time. \"Konda Tsutomu! Open the door!\"\n\nHe knew the game was up. There was only one thing they could potentially after him for. Maybe if he cooperated, he would perhaps escape with this with his life. With a trembling hand he opened the door, and faced the officers outside. \"Yes, officers, how may I help you?\"\n\n\"You are under arrest for conspiracy, and illegal insider trading,\" the officer said as two more grabbed his arms and cuffed him behind his back. \"Search the building,\" the officer ordered as Konda was led out. \"And take him to interrogation!\"\n\nKonda was only one of many ex-Yasuda board members caught in the conspiracy to be arrested that day. It did not take the Tokkō long to confirm their involvement - and that of the wider web of Takagi and Mitsubishi players.

 japkaya_tree_two.101.desc:0 "The Corporate Restrictions Act, or the CRA, has been killed by the Diet. Many said that passing the bill at all was impossible and that too many people's interests would be violated by the proposed bill. Perhaps it made sense to those who introduced the deal and that somehow - through sheer force of will - that it would be able to pass through the Diet. However, in the cold light of day, those who we condemned as 'pessimists' proved to be correct. The liberals and the Kido-ites managed to put aside their differences - focusing their rage against us and the bill.\n\nThe question of the Finance Ministry's power over corporate arbitration was too much for much of the Assembly to handle. Correctly perhaps, Takagi and Kido pointed out that this act would only increase Kishi's power and his vice-like grip over the commerce industry. Whatever the case, Kishi and his supporters have been left reeling after the news of their defeat, and Kaya remains silent after the vote.\n\nElsewhere, business leaders celebrate failure as a success for the economy. The bill, derided by the corporations as 'totalitarian' and the last stepping stone to 'governmental domination of the economy' will not be missed. However, the IJA do not share the same views. Army chiefs and corporals mourn the death of the bill as a 'terrible loss to Japan' and a 'capitulation to the Zaibatsu' and call for the placing of Japanese values above personal greed and gain.\n\nWhatever the case, Kaya must find a different route to his goals. It will not be found in the Corporate Restrictions Act."

I had little reason to think the 'Comintern puppets' would amount to anything significant.\"\n\n\"A view you were not alone in sharing,\" Kishi responded, face impassive.\n\nKaya smiled faintly. \"And now look at how the roles have reversed. The traditionalists in the Finance Ministry outmaneuvered by the ones they once scoffed at. I underestimated them, and so did everyone else.\"\n\n\"With your support,\" Kishi nodded once. \"You understand the benefit of legacy. The present matters little - how you will be remembered does. Continue this focus; continue to show the nation that you do not dance to the whims and strings of the corporations, that you put the interests of the public before all else. Be remembered as a patriot.\"\n\n\"I intend so,\" Kaya confirmed, pouring another drink. \"The nation comes before all. Today, tomorrow, and forever.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Kishi refilled his own glass. \"A reminder, perhaps unneeded, but which I will say all the same. Be wary of Fukuda. His ambitions and vision are not your own.\"\n\nKaya lifted an eyebrow at that. \"I do not think I need to fear him.\"\n\n\"All the same,\" Kishi said neutrally as he took another drink. \"I prefer to be prepared. Nonetheless, I trust you take these concerns to heart.\" He lifted his glass slightly. \"For now, we continue forward. For the Empire.\" Kaya lifted his own glass in return."

The regular spacing between them only highlighted a single gap, twice as large as the others, around an empty seat.\n\nCabinet Secretary Shiina Etsusaburo leaned over as Kaya motioned for the assembly to be seated. \"Mr. Aoki has pressing business elsewhere. I suggest we start without him.\"\n\n3:03 PM, Friday.\n\n\"Where's Aoki?\" Kaya tapped his left index finger impatiently on his right sleeve, waiting for the last senior member of the working group on educational reforms to present himself. \"Early is on time; on time is late. What's gotten into him?\"\n\nShiina's eyebrows knitted in concern as he received a note from an aide. \"His earlier meeting is running over. I'll have a word with him after this, don't worry.\"\n\n12:15 PM, Wednesday.\n\nKaya said nothing about Aoki's latest disappearing act, this time at a wage policy meeting in the Diet. As the agenda concluded, Shiina pulled Kaya aside to a corner of the cavernous meeting hall.\n\n\"Prime Minister, even I'm concerned about Mr. Aoki's absences. I think it's time we dig deeper.\"\n\nAfter three missed meetings in two weeks for no clear reason beyond 'pressing issues,' Kaya was inclined to agree."

So has Takagi. We all know each other. What's your point?\"\n\n\"The point, Prime Minister,\" Shiina said firmly while opening the file before Kaya, \"is that Aoki has been colluding with the reformists to undermine the government. He's been providing them our talking points and policy proposals. The reformists have always been quick with counter arguments - this is why.\"\n\nKaya, after one wary glance at Shiina, gingerly retrieved the file, leafing through its contents. He wanted to deny it, to toss the file into the trash and scream at Nagayama and Shiina to get out. For years, Kaya and Aoki had shed sweat, blood, and tears in service to the Empire, to think Aoki would betray him so easily - and so brazenly, in a manner certain to be noticed?\n\nIt stretched credulity, and yet here the evidence was - unmistakable contact between Aoki and Takagi, held in the open for all to see.\n\nEvidence that could be interpreted any number of ways, Kaya thought. For all Aoki could have given Takagi, he could have been gleaning information from Takagi in return. Takagi had been around for as long as Kaya or Aoki had been - better Takagi than Miki or another independent MP.\n\nKaya sighed. The bureaucrat in him screamed to find the right answer; the politician in him knew there wouldn't be one."

When Kaya had talked to Aoki in private, certain misunderstandings were clarified - namely, that while Aoki had been in touch with Takagi's faction, their shared dislike of the hardliners had been the only real topic worth discussing.\n\nNo shenanigans, no plotting, and - most importantly - Shiina had orchestrated Aoki's absences to frame him on false allegations.\n\nThe second fact: relations between Aoki's New Bureaucrats and the Hardliners were utterly broken. With evidence of Shiina's perfidy in hand, Aoki and Fukuda were quick to demand his resignation - and those of Kishi and Nagayama, for good measure. They were not so gracious to forgive such a grievous offense, and only a cabinet reshuffle in their direction would right it.\n\nThe third fact: politics is a game of numbers, and Kaya no longer had enough. Whatever commonalities existed between Takagi's reformists and Aoki's New Bureaucrats, joining any new cabinet was more trouble than it was worth. If the technocratic faction as a whole was disintegrating, the reformists would be happy to accept the New Bureaucrats - in a cabinet of reformist design.\n\nIt made no sense to bet on a losing horse, after all."

The Prime Minister's office was dark, almost pitch black, save for the flickering embers that played inside the fireplace. The warm orange glow embraced the two men like a close lover - a feeling that was not reciprocated. No. Kaya wouldn't get anywhere, wallowing in self-denial. It wasn't just ink on paper. It represented the final, wobbling tether between the old and the new. The resignation letter was a blade, brought to that last, squirming string - working so hard to keep everything in harmony. It sliced straight through it.\n\n\"You always had a choice.\" Kaya pleaded. \"I would have kept you on board! The others respect you, even if they can't show it. I respect you!\" The Prime Minister's eyes didn't bother to conceal anything. They had been through so much together; China, Pearl Harbour, the Peace, Yasuda. Here it all came crashing down. The moonlight cast long, winding shadows over the room, masking most of Aoki's face.\n\n\"When we started this,\" Aoki gestured to the room. \"This project. What did you say you wanted to me? You wanted a Legacy. A legacy with a capital L. Something you could look back on in your twilight years and point to. A fierce, independent Japan, led by a fierce, independent leader.\" Aoki sighed. Rarely in politics was an act based purely out of principle ever done. Which only made the times it did even more devastating. \"Why did you surrender yourself to Kishi and Shiina?\"\n\n\"They are powerful, Kazuo. More powerful than you can imagine. Japan needs that power. I need that power for Japan! For the good of the nation!\" Kaya cried out.\n\n\"I will stay if you answer one question,\" Aoki said. \"What are you going to do with that power? How will you use it, specifically?\"\n\nKaya stared at Aoki, silent. The Prime Minister of Japan did not speak because he could not speak. In front of the fireplace, the Secretary-General's shadow reached out towards Kaya, covering him. When that silent eternity passed, Kazuo Aoki, former Secretary-General of the Japanese Cabinet, stepped out of the room and out of politics forever."

 japkaya_tree_two.120.desc: "Shiina cradled a large bottle filled with a thick, black liquid. Its outline topped the drink; being the brightest scarlet that Kaya had ever seen, like the hue of a technicolor strawberry. Beside him sat the 'Monster of Shōwa' Kishi Nobusuke, holding a glass of Shiina's wine. Outside the window, the cold, clear Friday sky cast its harsh sunlight into the office, while the gnarled cherry blossom tree outside waved its bare branches to the gusts. Kaya laid back, slumping into his office chair, while the two spoke to each other.\n\n\"It's Korean,\" Shiina said, barely concealing his pride in his choice. \"I got it from Jinsen, a local market. Not the shabby inner-city markets. Those are for the Koreans. I am talking about artisanal places. This wine was supposed to be for the Japanese Official, in charge of the province, to stop grain requisitions.\" Shiina stopped smiling and put on a mock expression of sadness. \"I convinced the farmer personally to hand me the drink, and I would promise him that no crop of his would be taken, for one year. Shame corruption seems so endemic to the Empire. \"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Kishi said, taking a sip of the wine. He turned to Kaya. \"Did you deal with him? Will he be a nuisance to our plans?\" Kishi stared straight through Kaya, almost as if he was talking to some disembodied spirit.\n\n\"No. He handed in the note of resignation yesterday.\" Kaya said, nearly whispering. This was a victory, by all means. Aoki, the last obstacle in his path, was gone. All of his enemies, in their vain attempts to stand up to them, had been dashed against the rocks of the inevitable. Was it inevitable? All this? Japan now marched to a drumbeat, not dissimilar to the one it marched to in the 1930s. The storm clouds of war loomed overhead, once again. The Sphere frayed at the edges - a seething, writhing mass of lukewarm flesh and boiling idealism clashing for whatever resources they could find. But now, it was Kaya who found himself the Great Helmsman of Japan.\n\n\"Good,\" Kishi beamed. \"Then there's nothing left. Nothing left between us... and a better, stronger Japan. Long live Japan!\" Kishi held up a glass of wine. As did Shiina.\n\nAs Kaya raised his glass, the Japan of the 1950s died in its sleep. The past became a slave to the future. And the master would never let its serf out of its grip."

 japkaya_tree_two.121.desc: "Kaya stared into the fireplace in his office. The dying, orange embers flickered and leapt over each other as if it was a life-or-death competition. The warmth of the fireplace was an alien creature to Kaya, like the embrace of a passionate lover. The soft crackle of the fire, burning through the kindle, reminded him of his youth. His father would take him to the Imperial Gardens, during the autumn season, when the imported trees' leaves fell to the ground. Every step he would take, the leaves would make a satisfying crunch. Moreover, his father would gather a pile of leaves for him to jump into, to hear that noise closer up. His father had taught him a lesson, using that pile of leaves.\n\nGathering a pile was hard, fiddling work. It took finding lots of non-damp leaves and having the collection not be scattered by the wind. Yet, when completed, it was all worth it. Just to jump in and roll around in the leaves, without a single damn to the outside world. This was what the ideal society was. Men use all their talents and skills to build the perfect Japan - no matter the sacrifice. Nothing was out of the realm for building a utopia. Once it was all done, it was the job of the builders, to watch their children reap the rewards of their labor.\n\nAoki had handed him the letter just a few hours ago. He would stay as Secretary-General, beside the Prime Minister. In other times, this would have been good news - joyous news perhaps. A government, at the brink, is saved by the honor of its constituents. The hardliners would flay him for this move - if they didn't already know about it. With them turned against him, his delicate house of cards that he had built in Tokyo wouldn't be long for this world. It was always like this, this job. One wrong move and the entire thing would collapse. Just like it was doing now.\n\nThe only thing to do now was to resign; the final coup-de-grace that the hardliners salivated for. His legacy would remain, in fragments, but only if he left. Damn it; he was the Prime Minister! The most powerful man in the Eastern Hemisphere, why was he so powerless? So helpless and easy to bend? He couldn't resign. He wouldn't. Why should he? But, it was there - cloaked in darkness - he thought back to his father. What would he have done in his shoes?"

Japan's domestic stability and unity is pivotal to the growth of the Sphere, and without the said stability, many important reforms would never have the opportunity to be implemented.\n\nInvoking my experience as an Army officer and the Chief Executive of Guangdong, it became clear to me that self-sufficiency of the Sphere, independent from international trade with hostile states, is of the utmost urgency in today's global arena. Independence of foreign commerce not only set up an effective defense against degenerate ideologies that pose a threat to the East Asian way of life, in the never-so-distant event of a world war, self-sufficiency of war materials will also prove crucial for our national defense.\n\nOur reliance on American and Dutch oil imports substantially hampered our military effort in the Pacific War. The shortage of oil forced our commanders to make risky decisions in an effort to end the war as expeditiously as possible. Luck will not always be on our side, however, and the self-sufficiency of fuel should be of the highest priority.\n\nThough the Empire has liberated the Duch East Indies and now has access to oil fields in the said region, the inferior efficiency of our refineries requires our immediate attention. It is my humble recommendation that you empower the Ministry of Great East Asia to oversee this issue, so that the workload of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can be reduced, as they are already tasked with the crucial duty of managing our relationship with the OFN and the Reich.\""

He knew it all already - Suzuki and Kishi had been briefing him after every round of talks with Kaibara - and he was more than convinced of the proposal's merits.\n\nEven after the completion of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, energy scarcity had always remained an issue, especially with the growth of the automotive and plastic industries. Oil, as ever, remained the blood of a nation, and any sources of oil outside North America or the Middle East producers -and in Asia, no less - were utterly invaluable.\n\n\"President Kaibara, your proposal aligns entirely with government policy,\" Kaya remakred, setting the map aside. \"A self-sufficient, Pan-Asian economic ecosystem has been a cherished dream for the Empire for decades.\"\n\n\"That is wonderful to hear. But -\" Kaibara said, his expression grave. \"Oil exploration is ruinously expensive, as is security. Without government assistance in both, this project is doomed to failure.

If we do not act, then we will have a full-blown crisis soon. A humanitarian problem that the Empire is simply not capable of dealing with!\"\n\n\"How will expanding Nippon Oil deal with that, precisely? Will they extract peace and co-prosperity from the ground?\" one Diet member sneered. With cold daggers, Suzuki leered at the dissenting politician. To say that this bill was crucial was an understatement. If passed, it would mean that Japanese Autarky would no longer be a pipe dream. No longer would they have to kowtow to America - a nation that they had crushed on the battlefield - just because they happened to be blessed with their black gold. Japan would be able to stand on its own two feet as the undisputed hegemon of Earth's four corners.\n\n\"No. It will not 'extract peace from the ground'. I will tell you what it does. It will create jobs. Jobs across the Asia-Pacific region to help our brothers in need. Too long, we have proclaimed ourselves as a Pan-Asianist brother among their siblings. Yet how can we supervise our brothers if we cannot keep them in our house? Jobs create wealth, which means more spending. More spending means a higher standard of living. A higher standard of living. Who will they thank for this great opportunity? Us.\"\n\nSuzuki let that last phrase hang in the air. Across the seats, countless Diet members were nodding their heads, lost in thought. Yes, in Parliament he may have just won the battle. However, the Navy was bound to lose its temper over the bill. The South Pacific was their domain, to do as they please. Intruding onto that dragon's cave of tanned, brown Admirals and even browner rusty hulks would not go unnoticed. Or unpunished."

Gentlemen, we cannot do this if the other superpowers - the OFN especially - are interfering with Asian affairs from the Philippines to Malaya.'\n\n'This government has always argued that political security and economic security are deeply intertwined. The prosperity of Japan, and of Asia, requires that we do more to secure the trade lanes and hinterlands of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, to make Asia safe for development and industry.'\n\n'The proposed increase in the military budget - for both the Army and the Navy - is a necessary expense. To those who argue that we spend more on guns than butter at the expense of the common livelihood, in Japan and in Asia, think of how much more can be gained if Asia were allowed to develop in peace.'\n\n'Make no mistake - in the Cold War, Asia remains surrounded by enemies. If we are to have prosperity, we must first have peace.\""

 japkaya_tree_two.135.t: "Takagi's Compromise"
 japkaya_tree_two.135.desc: "The Diet, along with many observers, were waiting to see what Takagi would say on the subject of the bill - few were expecting an outright endorsement, but many expected that he would be open to being persuaded - or introduce a method to gaining his support, and that of the other reformists. It was an assumption which turned out to be accurate.\n\n\"National defense is an understandable and justifiable priority,\" Takagi stated in his address. \"It is necessary in the world where the Reich and Americans eye us, yet we should not be blind to the clear consequences of this bill. To put it simply - the economic goals outlined here are unattainable, not without significant and long-term losses.\"\n\nFor some, that had been believed to be the end of it - until Takagi went on to propose an amendment to the bill that would orient it towards a more palatable direction. Few were surprised to see that the revised bill would give the lion's share of the military funding to the Navy - but that was far from the only adjustment.\n\nWhere investment in Guangdong and Manchuria had been a centerpiece, the focus under Takagi's amendment shifted to increasing investment throughout all of Southeast Asia, not just the economic hubs of the Empire. Kaya followed all of these developments closely, knowing he had a choice before him.\n\nTakagi's proposed amendment was rather radical. These were major changes to the bill. He knew that if he supported the amendment, Takagi would back him, and passing this was important. However, aligning with the reformists no matter the reason would hurt support among the conservatives and create an equally unenviable situation.\n\nNonetheless, he needed to decide, and after some deliberation, he chose a course of action."

 japkaya_tree_two.136.t: "Fortifying the Empire"
 japkaya_tree_two.136.desc: "News of the passage of the Mobilization Act quickly spread throughout Japan and the wider Co-Prosperity Sphere - as well as quietly observed by other nations throughout the world.\n\nAnd with its passage, Japan wasted little time in beginning to implement it.\n\nNaval bases across Asia were provided with far greater increases in funding, as expansions to existing dockyards were planned, repairs to long-ignored issues were addressed, and still more bases were built to better position the Japanese Navy to respond to any threats to their sphere of influence.\n\nFunds also went out to many of the nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the Japanese economic hubs of Guangdong and Manchuria receiving a notable boost. Many other Southeast Asian nations - Thailand in particular - also found themselves bolstered with a generous Japanese investment.\n\nMoney flowed like water throughout the Empire and Co-Prosperity Sphere. While the critique for this influx of spending was muted within Japan, it was less because of a universal consensus, especially among the more liberal economists, and more due to said economists biting their tongues. When giving public statements they offered their support for the effort and mission of national defense - but those who read between the lines could see the implication. Implications, and subtle warnings, that this unrestrained spending was simply unsustainable.\n\nImplications that Kaya dismissed. His objective had been completed, and the legislation had passed. The Empire, and her interests, would be secured from the vultures that eyed them from across the sea, and for that, he was more than content."
 japkaya_tree_two.136.a: "The Empire secured - At least for now."
 japkaya_tree_two.137.t: "短絡的な結果"
 japkaya_tree_two.137.desc: "Kaya did not outwardly react as he read the headline of the morning paper. Perhaps it had been because he'd known it was coming that he found his reaction closer to resignation than anger at those who foolishly denied that these measures were necessary. Yet what was done was done.\n\nThe Mobilization Bill had failed to pass. He sipped his tea.\n\nThe press, the ministries, and the government circles he had insight into were seeing this as a blow to his agenda and government, and were already making implications on his future after this defeat. While few were saying it openly, behind closed doors he knew that many of the corporations and the liberal economists were celebrating the bill's failure.\n\nNot to mention the superpowers who wished nothing more for a weak Japan.\n\nSeveral rumors had already made it to him that the reformists were beginning to build their own national defense bill - one that was far more limited and gradualist in scope than his. Fools who were more concerned about abstract economic theories, and future returns acquired in decades rather than the needs of the Empire today.\n\nOf course, they didn't see that the failure to pass this bill already was hurting them. Since it had failed, Guangdong and Manchuria had been deprived of much-needed injections of credit and resources. It remained to be seen what the extent of the damage would be, but Kaya knew it would be enough to be felt at home - but especially there.\n\nThis was a defeat, but he would have to keep going. He would recover from this, he was sure of it. His agenda might have been stalled, but he would succeed in time. He would find an alternative, another way."
