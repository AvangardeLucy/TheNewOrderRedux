 POLITICS_PUJIE_DESC:0 "On paper, Manchukuo is an Empire - and every empire must have an Emperor. Though Aisin-Gioro Pujie was once born in the shadow of his elder brother - first the Xuantong and then the Kangde Emperor - circumstances have made him much more than just another Manchu noble. Noted as being much more charismatic and thoughtful than his brother, Puyi's inability to produce an heir has left Pujie the new heir presumptive - and witnessing firsthand the Court's prostrate servility to the Japanese at the cost of the people has made him determined to restore the Imperial Court to its true place: at the very apex of Manchukuo's government. Furthermore, his marriage to Hiro Saga, a Japanese noblewoman - surprisingly happy for one arranged - links him with the highest ranks of Tokyo's aristocracy and grants considerable amounts of legitimacy to his reform-minded end goals.\n\nWhether he will be able to effectively tie together this spider's web of influence and alliances to secure Manchukuo a constitution and an empowered throne and court against the endless pressure from outside forces - most dangerously, the Kwantung Army - remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - Pujie is at least determined not to end up like his brother has."
 POLITICS_GU_CIHENG_DESC:0 "Though many were surprised by Gu Ciheng's seemingly sudden rise to the office of President, those paying attention would have already realized it was a foregone conclusion. Having previously been the Deputy Director of the General Affairs Agency, he developed a strong and positive relationship with the Manchurian bureaucracy, retaining clear links with them even after being promoted to the cabinet. During his time in the Ruan cabinet, disagreements developed between Gu and reformist elements of Concordia seeking to curtail the influence of the bureaucrats on the state, and these tensions eventually erupted upon Puyi's death, leading to Gu cooperating with a coup launched by the bureaucracy that successfully took full control of the state and disbanded the Concordia Association. His own ambition fulfilled, and content with being the figurehead of the newly empowered bureaucrats, Gu Ciheng watches without interest from above as the government he supposedly leads undertakes perhaps the most drastic reforms Manchukuo has seen since it was established."

First dabbling with official work as a chief army medical officer for the Fengtian Clique, he steadily moved upwards through the ranks of local government positions until the formation of Manchukuo.\n\nOne of the founding members of the Concordia Association, his posts have now ranged from Minister for Education, to Finance, to Construction, with brief stints even in the Foreign Office. As one of its single most key officials, Ruan has made himself indispensable for the functioning of the Empire's government - though he has mostly focused on keeping it going despite immense contradictory pressures from outside, as opposed to beginning the process of change that it is increasingly becoming clear the state needs.\n\nWith Puyi's undecided succession turning from a smoldering, long-term problem to an immediate concern, Ruan as the 'caretaker' of the government now finds himself at the center of its apparatus, surrounded by people who only barely tolerate him and few real friends or allies. It is now evident that in order to survive the coming years, Concordia will have to rise out of its stupor and attempt to fulfill its long overdue promise - but how it will go about this rests on Ruan's decisions.§!"

In 1940, however, he was dismissed from his post for criticizing forced acquisition of agricultural land and control of industry by the Japanese government and Kwantung Army. Having made powerful enemies, Han retreated into the business world and became quite wealthy.

 MAN_Kamata_Senichi_eco_desc:0 "Economy Minister\nStratocratic Corporatism\n--------------\n§LOne of the most knowledgeable engineers in all of Manchuria, Kamata is said to have been tutored by none other than the American general Douglas MacArthur. Kamata worked on railways during the Greater East Asian War and continued that occupation in Manchukuo, growing a personal bond with the Mangyō corporation over his many years of service.\n\nThat's why the coup has been a disaster for Kamata, as economic fallout threatens to decimate the economy and Mangyō with it. It's of the utmost importance that the railways keep going so that the state itself does not crumble, and Kanata realizes this more than his colleagues.\n\nIn victory and in strife, Kamata has been loyal to the Kwantung Army. His skills prove to be among one of the many, many tools the Army has used to maintain order.§!"

The Mukden Incident brought him to the Asian mainland, notably running garrisons in Harbin and later Pyongyang during the Great East Asian War.\n\nAfter promoting all the way up to being a senior general over the span of thirty years, Takeshita retired to the reserve Kwantung Army; yet in many ways, through his wise talks with Kwantung leaders and willingness to return to work if need be, it's almost as if he is still in command.§!"

Dropping out of high school in the mid-1930s, he joined the 29th Infantry Regiment, studied at the Army Infantry School, and firmly cemented him into a life of serving in the Imperial Japanese Army. Being deployed to Manchuria in 1939, Inomata led a military career focused on logistics and intelligence rather than frontline combat.\n\nNow serving in Kwantung's cabinet after their coup of the civilian government of Manchukuo, Inomata has been placed in charge of overseeing the security of the internal situation for the whole state. Though experienced in the matters of military intelligence and internal affairs, Manchukuo may soon be too far gone for even a professional like Inomata..."
