 POLITICS_IBRAHIM_YUSUPOV_DESC: "Ibrahim Yusupov's father was a religious cleric and a wealthy landowner, which made him a prime target to be arrested and \"disappeared\" by Soviet authorities in the 1930s. This left Yusupov to be raised by a single mother, and he was forced to work as a child to keep his siblings fed and clothed. This harsh upbringing, however, did not deter him from his love of poetry, and he was able to complete a literature degree when he was twenty.\n\nYusupov's homeland of Karakalpakstan had been occupied by the Russian Empire, and later the Soviet Union, for the better part of a century, and their autonomy was gradually eroded over the decades. Unsurprisingly, the Karakalpaks were quick to declare independence and fend off any post-Soviet warlords after the Union fell. They were also fortunate enough to gracefully transition from communist rule to a functioning liberal democracy, free of strongmen and tyrants. While other, more authoritarian regimes may have repressed him, the free nature of Karakalpak society allowed Yusupov's career as a poet and journalist to not only be viable, but also flourish. He worked as a newspaper editor and professor of literature, and eventually threw his hat in the ring and ran for President of Karakalpakstan in 1961. His popularity as an author had gone a long way toward building a voter base, and his rhetorical command ensured that he always came out ahead in debates. But now that he has won the presidency, some question whether he can amount to more than simple poems and whether he can actually implement the policies he so lyrically endorsed."

 POLITICS_KADYROV_ABDURASHIT_DESC: "Should you ask anyone what defined the world as they knew it, you would certainly find yourself with a litany of answers depending on who you asked and where they were from. If you asked a young German, he would tell you of the West Russian War, breaking up the world and putting it back together just as it was meant to be. If you asked a young Russian Communist, he would tell you it was the day that the Revolutionary Front started fading. If you asked Abdurashit Kadyrov, he would tell you that the day that changed the course of history was the one that left the Germans at the A-A line.\n\nEven still, as the Russian Armies solidified around Syktyvkar, Kadyrov's dedication to the West Russian Revolutionary Front had only diminished with time, as his homeland grew more and more chaotic. As the West Russian War erupted, however, Kadyrov's dedication was tested, and it took every shred of his will not to send himself back to Karakalpakstan. In the last days of the Front, however, as Kadyrov found himself in the southern front of a collapsing war, he seized the chaos as his last chance back home. Having returned to a collapsed state of his disorganized brethren, Kadyrov took it upon himself to found a Karakalpakstan state alongside his fellow nationals, and the countless political exiles of Uzbekistan, fleeing persecution.\n\nLeading with the respect bestowed upon him through his exploits across the West Russian War and his goodwill accumulated from his actions in the first days of the new state, it is certain that Kadyrov will prove a thorn in the side of all those who would want to tear down Karakalpakstan, bar ensuring the safety of his people."
 KRK_uzbek_political_exiles_desc: "The turbulent, authoritarian nature of Uzbekistan has left much of its political scene heavily regulated, and firmly under the boot of the ruling party, with its opposition kept far away from the notion of gaining power from the Jadidi regime. Such is not the story in Karakalpakstan, however, as the nation functions under its relatively stable democracy, opening up its doors to the Uzbekistani ideologies forced out of their homeland.\n\nOf course, this policy has elicited hostilities with Uzbekistan, though as much is simply the cost of becoming a beacon of freedom."
 KRK_wolves_at_the_door_desc: "Karakalpakstan's troubles do not end with its hostile relationship with Uzbekistan, nor is it the least of its worries on a day to day basis for the average rural family on the outskirts of Karakalpakstan. Every week, there is a growing list of stories of the Russian and Kazakh bandits, sweeping into local towns and villages and plundering them for all they're worth, cutting down all those who stand in their way.\n\nWith murderers like these roaming our borders, countermeasures have proven absolutely necessary, taking the shape of a proper militia system spanning the nation. If these warlords hope to take a slice of Karakalpakstan, they will bleed for it, and our army exists only to ensure this fate."
 KRK_young_army_desc: "While Karakalpakstan has organized its military well to deal with bandits and warlords, there is no amount of preparations, planning, or effective command structuring that can make up for the inherent flaws in an army with a poor state of mind. Nowhere in Central Asia is this more prevalent than with the army of Karakalpakstan. Born from the local militias spanning the nation's borders, the army consists largely of young, passionate, inexperienced soldiers who think of fighting bandits as a breeze, whether or not they've actually faced conflict or shot their weapon in a combat scenario.\n\nAs a result of this mindset, each and every trial of combat faced by Karakalpakstan's army is one fought with bravery and stupidity. If we hope to maintain our security, we will need to remedy this issue in short order."
