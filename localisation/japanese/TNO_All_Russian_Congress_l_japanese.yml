 ARC.2.t: "ロシアはまだ倒れない"
 ARC.2.desc: "For fifty days our forces have beat the odds and stemmed the German tide. Göring's overconfident forces have become bogged down and are being opposed at every turn not only by our regular forces, but by spontaneous uprisings of the people. The heroism and dignity of the common Russian has held back the Hun's bayonet.\n\nHowever, a few members of our high command have examined our current situation, and their analysis is grim: supplies are growing thin, and the miracle we have experienced so far cannot last forever. We must face reality, they say - while we claim to be the legitimate government of all Russia, by any rational assessment we are simply a warlord state, and increasingly some within our high command are arguing that we lack the resources to take on a superpower alone. They call for an unprecedented move - reaching out to our rivals across Russia and forming a coalition to bring all of the country's resources to bear against the Teutonic hordes. Yet, it goes without saying that this would be politically costly and would risk putting too much trust in our enemies within Russia itself. Collaborating with our rivals could very well doom our vision of a united Russia to failure. But failing to do so could imperil the very idea of Russia itself.\n\nThis proposal has sparked a tremendous controversy within our faction's ranks, and a decision must be made."
 ARC.2.a: "Form the coalition. We will stand together."
 ARC.2.b: "Only we can save Russia. We fight alone."
 ARC.3.t: "西方の陥落"
 ARC.3.desc: "Under any other circumstances, the news of the total destruction of our rivals to the west would be cause for jubilation. Yet, the news that the German Wehrmacht has already subdued western Russia, on a timetable exceeding even the most liberal of estimates, only means one thing - we are next on the firing line, and we must face Führer Göring's gun alone.\n\nOr perhaps we need not go alone.\n\nConsidering the dire circumstances, it seems reasonable that our rivals elsewhere in Russia - as hostile to us as they may be - might be amenable to some sort of temporary coalition to push the wolf back from our collective doorstep. Doing so would involve putting a questionable and quite possibly excessive amount of trust in them. But, at the same time, if we could assert a leading role in such a coalition of all Russians, the opportunities to advance our own agenda could be numerous.\n\nYet, many of our generals argue that we can go it alone. Speaking of the readiness and training of their men and the might of our forces, along with the harshness of the terrain, they assert that we are more than capable of ending Herr Göring's little military adventure where others have failed, and proving once and for all that we are the rightful government of all Russia."
 ARC.3.a: "Form the coalition. We will stand together."
 ARC.3.b: "Only we can save Russia. We fight alone."
 ARC.4.t: "ささやかな提案"
 ARC.4.desc: "Today, our government received something highly unusual - diplomatic mail. Above-the-table, formalized diplomacy is not something that comes often, if at all, on the windswept steppes of warlord Russia. Our leaders have become accustomed to being addressed with disdain by other warlords, as a king would speak to a pretender to his throne. Yet today's arrival actually treated us like a sovereign government, for once - perhaps speaking to the desperation of those sending it.\n\n\"To the Leadership of the [Root.GetNameDef]:\n\nOur nation is once again threatened by the German behemoth. The Hitlerite beast is now at our door, and, try as we might, no single one of us can stem the Nazi tide alone. We have different beliefs and ideas of what Russia is and what it should be. But we are all Russians. We are but branches of the same tree, children of a lineage of a thousand years of hardship and triumph. The All-Russian Congress is exactly what it sounds like - a coalition of other warlords intended to bring the full resources of this nation and land we share to bear against the German war machine. Russians have only ever been victorious when standing together. We pray that you will stand with us in our fight to save Russia.\""
 ARC.4.a: "我々は共に立ち上がろう。"
 ARC.4.b: "No. Flattery cannot make this proposal sensible."
 ARC.5.t: "[From.GetNameDef]が議会に参加"
 ARC.5.desc: "[From.GetNameDef]'s leadership has seen the light. No doubt swayed by the threat posed by Göring's invasion, they have agreed to join the All-Russian Congress and provide their forces for the common defense of all Russia. Though it remains to be seen as to how materially they will actually contribute to the war effort, this, at the very least, bodes well for the All-Russian project."
 ARC.5.a: "数の強さだ。"
 ARC.6.t: "議会が結成された！"
 ARC.6.desc: "At long last, our rivals have seen the wisdom of our project to defend all Russia against the German threat. Today, in a packed hall in [Root.Capital.GetName], representatives of several of Russia's warlord states made a firm commitment to fight side-by-side in order to repel the invasion. Our government's propagandists have already hailed this as a shining victory of [Root.GetAdjective] diplomacy, and an undeniable display of our destiny to one day become Russia's one and only government.\n\nCynics, of course, have been quick to suggest that holding our rivals to the commitments they made today will be harder than it sounds, and that getting so many different governments, militaries, and militias to actually cooperate may be akin to herding cats. After all, as one general wryly commented, today's agreement is nothing but a piece of paper, and we live in a country where illiteracy runs rampant. But, for today, at least for a moment, optimism and idealism reigned, as we took a moment to remember that despite our political differences, we are still all Russians."
 ARC.6.a: "God save the Congress! God save Russia!"
 ARC.8.t: "[From.GetNameDEF]が加盟を希望！"
 ARC.8.desc: "計画に対する当初の反対にも関わらず、[From.GetNameDEF]は我々の考え方に近づいたようであり、本日全ロシア会議への参加を正式に要請した。多くの者が突然の心変わりに懐疑的だが、数の強さを否定する事はできない。"
 ARC.8.a: "ようこそ……同志よ？"
 ARC.8.b: "They cannot be trusted."
 ARC.9.t: "The Congress rejects Our offer!"
 ARC.9.desc: "Our humble request for membership in the All-Russian Congress has been denied! Whether this is the result of our initial opposition to the project somehow poisoning relations, or the product of some political intrigue, this is a grave insult and an unconscionable betrayal of the pan-Russian ideals the Congress claims to represent."
 ARC.9.a: "We are better off without such \"friends\"."
 ARC.10.t: "The Congress accepts Our offer!"
 ARC.10.desc: "No doubt eager to add our formidable strength to their own, the All-Russian Congress has formally accepted our request for membership, and has declared us a full member of the coalition against the German invasion. This marks a great step forward in our government's foreign policy, and confirms our position as a force to be reckoned with in the chaotic Russian political theater."
 ARC.10.a: "United we stand, divided we fall."
 ARC.11.t: "The Torch of Leadership Has Been Passed"
 ARC.11.desc: "With the recent collapse of [ARC_leader.GetNameDEF], until now the de facto leader of the Congress, the task of leading the coalition has fallen to our government. As [ARC_leader.Capital.GetName] falls silent and is claimed by the ravages of history, our state is presented with a task that is at once a titanic burden but also an opportunity of astounding magnitude. If we succeed where [ARC_leader.GetNameDEF] failed, our government will no doubt take a preeminent place in the struggle to reunify Russia. If we fail, however..."
 ARC.11.a: "God save the Congress. God save Russia."
 ARC.34.t: "議会の終焉"
 ARC.34.desc: "It is over. Finally, the Congress has fallen apart completely. Perhaps it was coming for a long time- it's unclear that anyone is surprised by its final collapse. However, with the flaming remains of the ARC coming down, so goes the dream of Russian cooperation. We are unquestionably alone.\n\nIt's unclear whether, without the ARC, the Russian people will be able to hold off the Germans any longer. Each warlord that Germany threatens has sworn to continue the fight- however, without the aid of those who once were our allies, we may no longer have the organization needed to push the Germans back. Though our men will certainly do their best to win the war, some are beginning to see the war as lost- in any case, it's certain to be much, much more difficult to win."
 ARC.34.a: "God help us."
 ARC.36.t: "議会の解散"
 ARC.36.desc: "The Germans are defeated! Finally, Göring and his pack of jackals have retreated, abandoning their hopes and dreams in the Russian plains, and we finally stand victorious over our enemies. However, as Germany falls, so too does the purpose of the All-Russian Congress, and it has been agreed that the organization shall be dissolved.\n\nThis is certainly a disappointment to those who thought the ARC could be the future of Russia, but perhaps this outcome was inevitable. The ARC, for its usefulness as a faction, was wracked internally by ideological debates between incompatible factions. It was doomed to collapse - this is certainly the best way for it to happen.\n\nWith the ARC gone, the conflict between warlords is sure to resume. Only the strongest shall emerge victorious. We can only hope that one day, Russia will be as united as it was in the heyday of the All-Russian Congress."
 ARC.36.a: "All good things must end."
 POLITICS_DAVID_DRAGUNSKY_DESC: "Dragunsky has seen Russia fall three times, and he will not let it fall again.. Born in 1910 to a family of Jewish tailors, Dragunsky initially became a construction worker in Novozybkov before getting drafted into the army in 1933. Then, the war began.\n\nDragunsky was placed in command of a tank unit as the Russian army collapsed. He and his men held their ground as best they could, but the Union fell all the same. In the resulting chaos, Dragunsky found himself and his men fighting for the West Russian Revolutionary Front against Kaganovich's men, forced into doing so by the remnants of the Red Army in West Russia. Then, the fighting died down, and the Front turned their attention towards the Germans. Dragunsky once again commanded his men to kill as many Germans as possible only for the government he was loyal to to fail, and Russia with it. From there, Dragunsky's men wandered the ruined wastes of Russia, biding their time until someone would unify it.\n\nWhat he didn't expect was the Germans to be the ones to do it.\n\nWith Russia defeated yet again, Dragunsky vowed to not stand by and watch anymore. He refused to surrender this time. He and his remaining loyal crew set to work creating a partisan network that spanned the whole of Russia. They would not be torn apart by internal division or ideology this time, this was a matter of life or death. As months pass and it seemed like Russia would never be free again, news reached the exhausted crew. The Germans were in another civil war! Dragunsky and his men have now seized land from the Germans' tired Reichskommissariats, and are prepared to drive the fascist dogs from their lands. They will make sure that Russia will never lose again, no matter what the cost."
