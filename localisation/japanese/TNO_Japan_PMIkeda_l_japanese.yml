 JAP_stressing_oligarchic_importance_desc:0 "When the Meiji Constitution was drafted by the first Privy Council of the Empire its main inspirator, Ito Hirofumi, warned of the dangers of populism and Western demagogy. He was inspired by the oligarchic character of the Prussian charter of 1850, and since then the Privy Council and the House of Peers have acted as the strongholds of our aristocracy and of our best thinkers in an age where populists and rabble-rousers foul up the air of the Diet with their nonsense. These organs will, in the future, be at the center of the Prime Minister's attention, and we will promise to make it so that their enlightened opinion cannot be ignored as easily as it has been."

The Peers' titles are granted directly by the Emperor in recognition of either great personal deeds or illustrious ancestry. They make up a considerable portion of the House of Peers, and many have served as Prime Ministers and senior public servants. The Prime Minister intends to restore this exalted group to its proper pedestal after the vagaries and insults it suffered at the hands of populists and lowborn military brutes."

Legendary for lobster dishes worthy of the imperial kitchens and its artful theater performances, the Koyo Club is a small corner of paradise in the Maple Hill Park in Shiba. Its clientele comprises the loftiest titles of the Kazoku, international personalities and some of the wealthiest businessmen of Japan.

Advised by the genrō and served by the last loyal samurai, his divine will saw Japan through its darkest hour. No ceremony or act of deference would be enough for this titanic figure, a man standing as a living bridge between Japan's mythical past and the glories of its recent years, but the Prime Minister has resolved to try and honor the memory of this great Emperor with speeches, monuments and a new national holiday corresponding to the date of his coronation."

His descendants are honored members of the Kazoku, ranked as Dukes. Approaching the heirs of such a legendary lineage is challenging, but their voice carries great weight in the Court and the Prime Minister is determined to bring them on his side."

 JAP_acknowledging_contributions_desc:0 "The recent history of Japan was not shaped only by generals and politicians - looking at our predecessor, we ought to be glad of this - and it is time that a Prime Minister acknowledged the contributions of these men to the prestige of Japan.

 JAP_hirobumis_blessing_desc:0 "The noble spirit of Ito Hirofumi, great father of the Meiji Constitution, elaborated the political concept of Kokutai, or national polity, as the constitutional justification of the Emperor's sovereignty and as the bedrock of the survival of the Japanese as an independent nation. To signify continuity between the goals of the genrō and our own plans Prime Minister Ikeda will visit the Hirofumi family shrine to ask for the blessing of this great statesman."

 JAP_the_new_mandate_desc:0 "In succeeding to Ino, Prime Minister Ikeda inherited a broken Yokusankai and a sinking ship of a country. In a few short months, he has managed to unify the Yokusankai with like-minded members of the House of Peers, stabilize the ever-delicate Kenkyūkai and build up his own reputation in front of the public and in the highest echelons of Japanese society. Now, armed with a mandate backed by a diverse coalition of centrists, moderate reformers and conservatives, the Prime Minister's great work can finally begin."

 JAP_holding_the_diet_hostage_desc:0 "Our connections with the Privy Council and the House of Peers mean that our Cabinet wields nearly unprecedented power over the Diet. Whatever proposal comes from the opposing camps of the Yokusankai or the Independents, whatever dissent is expressed by our allies, we will always have someone further upstairs who can intervene in our favor. Any Representative who opposes us will find his legislation stonewalled by the Peers; any Peer who gets too uppity will find out that there are ways to bring even the most august members of the Diet in front of an auditing committee. The cabinet's control is, for the first time since Tōjō's term, absolute."

 JAP_backing_by_the_old_zaibatsu_desc:0 "The Prime Minister's favored partners in the world of finance would have been the \"Old Zaibatsu\", also known as the Big Four: the Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Yasuda Zaibatsu. Two of them traced their roots to the Edo period, and the youngest two were founded in the flourishing of the Meiji Era. Of those four, Mitsubishi and Mitsui survived the economic upheaval through a merger, and this colossus has in turn absorbed the collapsed Yasuda Group. Sumitomo has dissolved into loose and uncontrollable Keiretsu, but we can still find some backing in the new Mitsubishi group and in some of the minor Zaibatsu that survived Yasuda's downfall."

 JAP_konoes_overreach_desc:0 "Konoe Fumimaro had long been a figure of legend among the members of the Diet. A member of the imperial family that had graciously condescended to provide tutelage and leadership to the members of the lesser-regarded Lower House. However, Konoe was not without his flaws. The reformists had long regarded the centerpiece bill of his government, the National Mobilization Law, as evidence of autocratic tyranny and a product of a mind that did not understand the desires and thoughts of the commons.\n\nThe reformists and conservatives have joined together to table a motion to repeal this authoritarian law. Formally at first, and then dismantling the system piece by piece. Japan is not at war, nor are there any threats to its dominion of the Greater Co-Prosperity Sphere. Maintaining the law for any second longer would equal giving free rein to outdated systems designed for the past. It is time for Japan to wrench herself loose from archaic, ancient priorities."
 JAP_loosen_zaibatsu_nationalization:0 "Loosen Zaibatsu Nationalization"
 JAP_loosen_zaibatsu_nationalization_desc:0 "The Second Sino-Japanese War took a toll on the landscape of Japanese economics. Japan triumphed in the end, but it paid millions in yen, manpower, and industrial assets to achieve such a victory. One example of a price the war had extracted was the nationalization of Zaibatsu assets under the now-repealed National Mobilization Law. Though the Law is no longer in force, the ordinances and restrictions that bind the productions of materiel still exist. Dismantling the force of this nationalization would be the first step towards freeing Japan from the shackles of its past.\n\nAlthough the assets would remain in government hands until further notice, the cabinet shall order a unilateral halt to production. The Ministers responsible shall redirect these assets for use under the advice of the Zaibatsu, formal redistribution pending the government's discretion. Such a time would arrive that the Japanese economy is free. It must wait."

Guardians of tradition and Japanese values of innovation as well as stability. Through the worst of the War, the Zaibatsu families have steadfastly supported the cause of the Empire, lending their industrial might to finance and hold together the sinew and muscle that rendered the final Japanese triumph possible. However, the assets that made victory conceivable remain in government hands, a token of scalding callousness unbecoming of any upright state.\n\nA redistribution is in order, and long-time coming. The reformists and conservatives shall make a deal with the families that form the oldest, strongest pillars of the Zaibatsu name. In exchange for closer coordination, they shall regain control of the factories they had donated to the government decades prior. No government is great that does not compensate its citizens."
 JAP_end_wartime_rationing:0 "End Wartime Rationing"
 JAP_end_wartime_rationing_desc:0 "In the era where Japan cruises itself to its place among the superpowers of the new cold war, it seemed odd that a rationing system is still in place. America and Germany are enjoying their economic growth, while the Japanese still subsist on the limitations imposed on it by the National Mobilization Law. With a cap on consumer spending, the economy can only grow at a snail's pace. Luxuries such as tea and tobacco are not freely available, prompting an emergence of a black market that seeks to rob honest, hardworking citizens out of the fruits of their labor.\n\nThe reformists have, since the foundation of their clique, demanded the abolishment of price controls and other such measures that hamper the consuming habits of the Japanese people. With them in government, it became one of the conditions of their confidence in the chambers of the Diet. If their proposition passes, the average citizen would no longer be inhibited by arbitrary measures designed to win a war already won."
 JAP_loosen_urban_curfews:0 "Loosen Urban Curfews"
 JAP_loosen_urban_curfews_desc:0 "Included in the National Mobilization Law was another provision that stood out in an age where Japan no longer fears war. Urban curfews, designed and instituted by Konoe's government, seemed an artifact of terror, of a time where the fate of Japan was uncertain. Its degrees vary from prefecture to prefecture, but after certain hours, the average citizen would confine themselves to their residences, forbidden from traveling at night without a permit lest they are arrested by the Kenpeitai.\n\nThe reformists push for a complete and total abolishment of curfews. The conservatives, however, with their concerns for the morality of the public, had found a new use for it. Ikeda and Takagi have to compromise, and the measures they arrive at is the lessening of curfew hours as well as relaxation of the requirements for a permit. Such was the beauty of the coalition: the two proponents acting as both water and shape. Should one stand firm, the other will follow."

Through the strength of compromise, Ikeda and Takagi have opened a new way for Japan to proceed. One based not on the dogmatic tenets of either faction, but pragmatic decision-making, combining the best of both worlds. With the achievement of a consensus between the reformist and conservative thought in the Yokusankai, the future of Japan never looked as bright before.\n\nHowever, this is merely the beginning of a beautiful friendship. An unlikely, but fruitful and surprisingly natural alignment of political interests has provided the government with new courses of action that it would not have even considered under sole conservative dominance. A new way, that combines the sense of the conservatives and the sensibility of the reformists, now lay open. The only thing that remains is to follow in its tracks."

Other than the more urgent issue of the economy, decency has proven to be the most divisive point between Ikeda and Takagi's portions of the Diet. The conservatives argue that public morals are an essential part of the Kokutai, while the reformists claim that prescribing morality belongs to an archaic, barbaric age.\n\nThis is another compromise on the Prime Minister's agenda. In exchange for keeping a lid on Takagi's student followers, Ikeda will persuade the old, irritable, and stubborn conservative MPs to soften their stances on social issues. Although public decency is crucial in theory, without a hold on power, the government's position would mean nothing at all. You win some, you lose some. Such is the rule of life, and of politics."

The students are the most salient supporters of Takagi, and youth is rarely marked by either restraint or quietude. The rest of the Yokusankai look down on them, for without experience they are dissidents whose opinions hold danger to the integrity of society. The reformists, in contrast, cater to them.\n\nThis is where they would have to concede. In exchange for implementing their stances on the economy and issues of social nature, Takagi would have to tell his youthful followers to - for the lack of a better phrase - calm the hell down. The Kokutai, if preserved, shall serve Japan and her citizens in due time. Once they have garnered experience and lived a bit more, perhaps we would see their point. As it stands, the sit-ins and demonstrations change nothing."

Long gone were the days where the public's distrusted the Diet under Ino; in Ikeda and Takagi's hands, the sacred and implicit bond between the state and the people had been reforged.\n\nAll of this has resulted in a slight change of course for the cabinet and the government. Rather than ruling from where he had stood before, Ikeda would reign closer to the center. The Prime Minister and the government would strive to represent more than the narrow band that the reformists and conservatives would appeal towards. Together, the cabinet shall march towards a moderate model, a universal governance that serves all sections of society."

Kido, on the other hand, had noble connections and came from a lineage that held the blood of various statesmen instrumental in the foundation of the modern state of Japan. Their views on how to conduct politics could not be more different.\n\nKido, however, insists on reconciling these divergences. He demands that, as the Prime Minister's partner, that he be permitted to manage politics his way, on his terms. Ikeda, of course, is more than happy to allow him to do so. Though the PM is wary of nobles meddling in the affairs of the commons - after all, Konoe's term was nothing short of a series of crises - a bit more leverage would not hurt. Though Kido would eventually start to demand more, the conservatives must first cement their foothold in the Diet, and if the voices of nobility are needed, so be it."

Only one clique remained pure of this sort of corruption: the Kidoites. Following the example of their namesake, they have been the strongest advocate for more civilian oversight. With Kido ruling in tandem with the conservatives, this might finally be achievable.\n\nKido's plan hinges on using his Privy Council connections to ensure that the Army and Navy get out of the government's way of cementing civil oversight and control over the Kokutai. By leveraging a pillar of Japan's structure against another, Kido hopes to achieve an equilibrium on which he can dismantle the domination of militaristic elements on Japanese democracy."

The Army and Navy are powerful institutions, but their power is not what concerns Kido. It is the fact that they are political. With their fingers in every pie, both branches of the military can intervene in all the matters of the Diet with ease. Kido argues that, however successful Ikeda's premiership would be, the military will become a threat, sooner or later.\n\nAs with all of Kido's solutions, he proposes to skip the Diet in the handling of this matter. Instead, he will go to the Privy Council and the House of Peers, where he shall propose amendments to set the boundaries between the legislative and military bodies of the government. By curtailing the military's power, Kido gives Ikeda one less hand, one less watcher that seeks to undermine his efforts."

Although Kido is nominally a Technocrat, he and his followers do not support the kind of extreme economic control and Keynesianism that Kaya endorses wholeheartedly. Simply put, the reformists under Takagi can stay; the Technocrats under Kaya are dead weight.\n\nTo accomplish this objective, the conservatives and Kidoites of the Yokusankai shall form a cordon-sanitaire around Kaya. They shall then discredit him at every opportunity: through the press, in private meetings, and voting procedures. With their leaders behind layers and layers of slander, Technocracy should fall apart soon after. If not, Kido is certainly preparing for a contingency."

There are still deputies that insist on peddling this extreme, mindless and un-Japanese ideology. These present a particular headache for Kido. As members of the Diet, he cannot target them individually as he did Kaya. However, in the grey eminence's mind, there is more than one way towards a scandal.\n\nIkeda came into power with the promise of eradicating corruption within the Diet and elsewhere. Kido can arrange for select deputies, only coincidentally being Technocrats, to have a political equivalent of an accident. In politics, friendly fires occur all the time - why should the Yokusankai be different in this regard? Once they are out of the way, the political machine of the Yokusankai will cover for them.

The two remaining factions, the Kidoites and the conservatives, are joined in a union that had seen off military interference in the Diet. Truly, a beautiful friendship.\n\nYet, much still stands on the path of real and sincere unity between Ikeda and Kido.

For these backbenchers and rebels, the government founded upon cooperation with the conservatives is unrepresentative of their views.\n\nIkeda has requested Kido to reign in his supporters. If the government is to continue, there can be no dissent allowed within its ranks. Kido is only loyal to his ends, but without the conservatives, those ends would remain a dream as faint as the cherry blossoms in the first days of summer.

Some Kidoites still claim to chafe under the benevolent and enlightened rule of the conservatives, and even Ikeda admits that such thinking is inevitable, given what had transpired.\n\nNow comes the carrot. In return for their loyal support for the cabinet, the Prime Minister shall reward them by promising real opportunities for compromise. After all, if this coalition were to rule Japan for a long, long time as Ikeda intends to do, there would be plenty of such.

Though the factions that comprise the coalition have their doctrinal differences, not to mention diverse loyalties, it is undeniable that they share more in common than with the other factions of the Diet.\n\nThe compromise between these divergent political ideologies has resulted in a new way of thinking. A traditionalist, conservative Yokusankai, one that becomes a bastion for the preservation of Japanese culture and values, is now a reality. In the dark, uncertain years ahead, this coalition shall serve as a fortress to fend off the threat of extremism and to cull the excesses of populism.

His containment of military interests, extremist populism, and socialism seemed the perfect model for the coalition.\n\nAn effective governance is one that listens to the people, but does not give in to their excesses. While the individual citizen has the right to be heard, the mob has no authority with which to compel the government into subservience. Militarism and populism do not belong within a narrow category of Japanese values; valor, might, and consensus will do. Thus, the cabinet and coalition invent the Kinmochi doctrine: a traditionalist spin on conservatism that seeks to reconcile the Upper House with the Lower.

However, this move would face a great deal of opposition by both the technocrats and the Dainihon Seijikai, as this move can be seen as a futile attempt at propping up a dying machine.

He looked back up at Ikeda and nodded in agreement with the Prime Minister, and the two discussed further on their dealings in the Diet."
 japikeda.57.a:0 "We are at a zero-sum game."
 japikeda.58.t:0 "The Moderate Mandate"
 japikeda.58.d:0 "With resounding applause in the Diet, Prime Minister Ikeda stood impassioned by his support for his speech given to the chamber. Stood behind the podium overlooking the Diet, he bowed and waved to the bobbing heads across the chamber floor who clapped and chattered in approval of his speech outlining his intentions for the empire. Ikeda now commanded the support of the moderate bloc now centered around him thanks to the reformists' support of his administration, forming a comfortable foundation for him to pass legislation in the chamber.\n\nHe was the king of the Diet, at least for the time being, and behind his pleased grin ran thoughts of urgency. Anticipating friction, he believed that action to pass his legislation must begin before the opposition clock of his potential to overturn the many laws of the past that defined the dysfunctional status-quo."
 japikeda.58.a:0 "Let us begin."
 japikeda.59.t:0 "Attempts at Reforms of National Mobilization Law"
 japikeda.59.d:0 "Ikeda sat in a boardroom surrounded by his cabinet, and with their desperate attention he declared his intention to reform the National Mobilization Law. Yoshio, struck by the move, made his confusion clear and expressed his doubts over how the government could move such a monumental and concrete law passed in the Konoe Era. A similar doubt proliferated between his men, much to Ikeda's frustration, and they all grew concerned looks on their faces.\n\nCalming down the cabinet, Ikeda confessed to his men that with the newfound impetus of the reformist faction of the Taisei Yokusankai, he may find enough support in the Diet to amend the restrictive conditions Japan lives under imposed by the wartime measures. Ikeda down at his notes, continuing to read the conditions of his propositions, but as he looked up he noticed the lack of confidence shared between his cabinet. Scoffing at their skepticism, he asked them to look beyond the semantics of the initiative and get to work with the task at hand."
 japikeda.59.a:0 "Moving mountains, Mr. Ikeda?"
 japikeda.60.t:0 "The Responsibilities of Leaders"
 japikeda.60.d:0 "Kido was in Ikeda's office, and he had come to speak to him about an issue that has been on his and many other members' minds for a while now - the militarism of the Diet. Kido reasoned with the Prime Minister, demanding that he would at least be aware of the military's influence over the politics of the empire. Landing heaps of reports and documents containing evidence of corruption and political coercion on Ikeda's desk, he urged him to flick through them all and see for himself. The Prime Minister was unimpressed with Kido's demand, but perhaps more unimpressed at the fact it was his responsibility to look into it.\n\nOffering banal platitudes and forced grins of approval, Ikeda extended his support to Kido's requests and dragged the pile of reports from the edge of his desk towards himself. Investigating military influence was surely something to grab the attention of his adversaries, Ikeda thought, dreading what would come of the endeavor. He sank back in his chair, exhausted, and returned his flustered attention to a satisfied Kido who was pleased with the Prime Minister's kind and considerate cooperation."
 japikeda.60.a:0 "Leave it with me."
 japikeda.61.t:0 "Securing The Reigns"
 japikeda.61.d:0 "Ikeda, convening with his Deputy Prime Minister, Hatoyama Ichirō, sat at his desk and leaned back in his soft, leather chair. He inhaled a deep breath, calm and relaxed, before opening his eyes and smiling at his colleague with a pleased grin. He mumbled, holding back a cackle, and finally broke the silence by addressing his deputy directly.\n\nHe chuckled, uttering his words with total satisfaction; the Technocrats had been neutralized in the Diet by the maneuvers and deal-brokering of Prime Minister's moderate bloc. Ichirō, with a confused yet impressed smile crawling across his face, prodded Ikeda for an explanation. He was met with a gleeful reply, as Ikeda explained how now the right wing of the Taisei Yokusankai has now been secured - cementing his authority over the Diet."
 japikeda.61.a:0 "Send him back to counting coins."
 japikeda.62.t:0 "Comrades and Peers in Arms"
 japikeda.62.d:0 "Ikeda, scheming in his office, scurried between different sheets of paper to scribble down notes. He flicked through dossiers provided to him by Masumi, his home minister, pulling together information about Kidoite politicians in the Diet. His aim was to strong-arm their votes to support his ruling coalition, and he was determined to see them submit to his premiership over the nation.\n\nIn the chamber, his speeches and maneuvers had convinced the Kidoites that they shared the same interests as the conservatives - whereas, in truth, his words had drawn them out to vote for conservative bills and efforts. Manipulation of the truth, Ikeda thought as he chuckled to himself, was the key to success in fooling his allies to fight his battles for him."
 japikeda.62.a:0 "The carrot and the stick."
 japikeda.63.t:0 "Feeding the Hounds"
 japikeda.63.d:0 "\"The manipulation of the Kidoites can not continue without making sacrifices,\" Ichirō noted to Ikeda, who was growing weary of his allies' attention in the Diet. Indeed, the Kidoites were experts; they were arguably the brightest in the field of political bargaining, and they would make it known when they were not satisfied with a good deal. Ikeda looked over to Ichirō and nodded quietly, admitting concessions had to be made if this alliance was to continue to bolster the Prime Minister's standing in the Diet. To lose their support would potentially make them enemies of the conservatives, threatening the integrity of the Taisei Yokusankai, and the position of the Prime Minister himself."
 japikeda.63.a:0 "Our government can accomplish its goals."
 japikeda.64.t:0 "Remembering the Genro"
 japikeda.64.d:0 "Sat in a relaxed and luxurious private bar overlooking the Tokyo skyline, and in the presence of various celebrities and aristocrats from throughout the empire, Kido and Ikeda lazily reclined in soft chairs whilst sipping on expensive champagne imported from Europe. They had rested there and discussed rather amicably from the late afternoon and as the sun set, they continued to chatter into the night about their positions in the Diet and in the service of the nation.\n\nIkeda, after putting his glass to the side of his chair, spoke eloquently of his duty to uphold the legacy of the last Genros, the 'founding fathers' of modern Japan. He expressed his admiration for the politicians and prime ministers of the Meiji and Taishō Eras, hoping he could emulate the same masterful leadership and successes in the reign of the current Emperor. Kido raised his glass and took a gulp of champagne, seconding Ikeda's wishes but remaining notably silent and withdrawn from the ramblings. The Prime Minister looked over to Kido and nodded slowly, pondering if his actions in the Diet were worthy of the Genro, and if he would be satisfied with the legacy he has written for himself so far."
 japikeda.64.a:0 "Can we make a man out of memory?"
 japikeda.65.t:0 "The Grey Eminence's Plot"
 japikeda.65.d:0 "The latest drives of Kido in the Diet and with the conservative's support has been directed towards suspicion of corruption and conspiracy from leading Technocrats in the Diet. Accusing them of siphoning funds to private accounts, abusing the powers of their office, and maliciously threatening the integrity of the Taisei Yokusankai, Kido has railed against the technocratic faction's dealings in the political affairs across the empire.\n\nLeading members of the Technocrats such as Kaya Okinori and Kishi Nobusuke, as well as other members of the faction, have been railed against in the Diet with these treasonous accusations, and much suspicion is raised around their dealings in the affairs of the country. Although much of Kido's words are not backed by evidence, his bold claims bring defamation nonetheless as the word 'Scandal' is printed on nationwide press."
 japikeda.65.a:0 "Perhaps some fellows in the Board of Audit can investigate?"
 japikeda.66.t:0 "Differing Reports"
 japikeda.66.d:0 "Ikeda flipped through the Board of Audit's recent report over Kido's claims of corruption in the Diet. It was the Cabinet's job, after all, to review their files before being sent to the Imperial Diet as a whole. Ichirō and Masumi both had their own copies, and it did not take long before the Deputy Prime Minister spoke of a discrepancy.\n\n\"Prime Minister, we must be weary of Kido's outrageous claims in the Diet; with every word he speaks, he creates enemies for himself and for us, by association. I am not here to tell you if you should ask him to shut his loud mouth or not, but we cannot afford to let him go unchecked!\"\n\n\"Sir, although Mr. Masumi has a point, I think there's a hidden audit in these. Some reports mention an investigation into one of Kaya's supporters, rather unprompted. It's something we should really look into, if Kido is willing to scream for hours about these accusations.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister, heeding the advice of his colleagues, sat behind his desk scratching his chin. He exhaled a deep sigh, before grasping a handful of more reports and dismissing the two men. As they bowed and exited his office, Ikeda scoured through the papers over and over, intensely brushing the forms for mistakes to save him from dealing with a potential scandal in the Diet."
 japikeda.66.a:0 "Check to see if they lead anywhere."
 japikeda.67.t:0 "On Their Tails"
 japikeda.67.d:0 "Masumi returned to the Prime Minister a few days later with a final and conclusive report on the investigation into Kido's claims; the audit was correct, Kaya's men had nothing of noteworthy status to incriminate them in crimes of corruption or fraud. Ikeda, flicking through the reports, felt a washing wave of relief prickle over his body, as he did not have to deal with a case of corruption in the Technocrats.\n\nAs the hunt for Kido's criminals had ended, Ikeda had taken the time to pen a speech to address possible corruption among his opponents in the Diet across all factions of the Taisei Yokusankai. The Prime Minister had noted fears surrounding Kaya and Kishi's investigations had caused enough of a ruckus to whip them in line in attempt to quell suspicion; threats to investigate many others may subordinate them to his authority too. It was a risky move, but Ikeda was willing to hedge his bets to win over the fear and respect of his adversaries."
 japikeda.67.a:0 "Sometimes a threat is more powerful than the act itself."
 japikeda.68.t:0 "A Pure Diet"
 japikeda.68.d:0 "After the Prime Minister spoke about the dangers of corrupt groups in government, and declared a number of proposals to expand the Board of Audit, the mood in the Diet had changed significantly. Even if there was no illegal and dangerous behavior at all, Ikeda had gotten exactly what he had wanted from his speech - a greater sense of authority built on top of the fear and respect of his allies and adversaries.\n\nWith the confidence of the Technocrats reigned in, they largely stand, albeit reluctantly, in line with the Prime Minister's proposals for bills and legislation. Kaya and Kishi, bitter as ever, watch his every move, but Ikeda can only smile and chuckle as he sits in one of the most powerful seats in the world as Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan."

 japikeda.1.d:0 "\"I can't believe it! This dark horse candidate won out?\" uttered Hatoyama Ichirō with a hint of disbelief.\n\n\"Lay it off, Ichirō. Look, he's the only man our bloc can somehow compromise on. Plus, he's been here for twenty years, and doesn't really come with any baggage,\" replied Satō Eisaku.\n\nWhile the conservatives themselves aren't a dark horse faction by any means, Ikeda Masanosuke arguably is. First elected as an independent in 1942, he gradually became more and more associated with the Yokusankai - earning himself a mildly respected position, which seemingly peaked when Ino appointed him as the Minister of Defense following Inukai Takeru's dismissal.\n\n\"You know what, you're probably right, Eisaku. I mean, he has to come to his senses and pick a faction eventually - all his talk of Taishō-era idealism would be for naught if he doesn't.\"\n\n\"Both you and I know he's got little opportunity to run. Who's he gonna run to? Takagi? All I'm saying, Ichirō, is that he needs us as much as we need him.\"\n\nSatō is correct - Ikeda was a compromise candidate, not only within the Yokusankai, but also within his own faction. In an ideal world, someone more experienced, such as Hatoyama himself or maybe even Ikeda Hayato would be nominated. However, the reality of the matter couldn't be further from that ideal - the conservatives were forced to pick a candidate with little baggage, especially following Ino's downfall. Their pondering was interrupted by two knocks.\n\n\"Gentlemen, sorry to interrupt, but urgent news from Kantei.\"\n\n\"Well what is it? And close the door behind you.\" replied Hatoyama. \"The Prime Minister has appointed Hatoyama Ichirō as the Deputy Prime Minister, and Satō Eisaku as the Minister of Finance.\"\n\nThe secretary's words left a silence in the room, before Satō muttered, \"By god, this fool might be smarter than I thought.\"\n\n\"That is all for now. The Prime Minister expects you at his first Cabinet meeting in two days. Excuse me, gentlemen.\" replied the secretary, gently closing the door behind him."
 japikeda.2.d:0 "The morning sunrays streamed through the Cabinet chambers' windows. It is a new day for Japan, and the first day of Ikeda Masanosuke's administration. Seated around him was his cabinet, which contained Diet veterans such as Hatoyama Ichirō as well as powerful deputies such as Satō Eisaku. The clock strikes nine, and Ikeda declares the cabinet meeting open\n\n\"Good morning gentlemen, it's a pleasure to be in the presence of such talented and honest individuals. I handpicked all of you from lists going up to the hundreds, so if you are in this room today, you all are a cut above the rest.\"\n\nThe cabinet applauds Ikeda's first impression, as Ikeda thought to himself, \"Maybe this could work.\"\n\n\"Now, moving on to our first agenda of the day - Factional alliances and projecting our platform. But bef-\"\n\n\"With all due respect, Daijin-sama, what exactly is our platform?\" Hatoyama interjected. \"I'm glad you asked, Hatoyama-san. What I envision for our administration is an administration of integrity and moderation. None of that radical bull Kaya or Kido have in mind.\"\n\nBoth Ikeda and Hatoyama are aware that Ikeda's answer was merely the politically savvy one, and not the platform he actually envisions. The two refuse to acknowledge it however, as Hatoyama gestures to Ikeda to move on.\n\n\"And in order to achieve that, we can't just rely on our own, no. We've got to reach out across the aisle, and our destination is the Reformists and maybe, even Kido's clique. It's not going to be easy, mind you, but as long as they need us more than we need them, they'll fall into our hands.\"\n\nThe Cabinet applauds the new prime minister, as Ikeda proceeds to outline their projected fiscal spending for the year."
 japikeda.3.d:0 "\"Prime Minister, you have the floor.\"\n\nIkeda reaches for the dossier with his speech on it, but holds himself back at the last minute. He's been a deputy for 20 years - what's so different about this speech? \"Just hit the right buttons,\" he thought to himself. His time for thinking expired however, as he approached the centre of the Diet floor.\n\nThe room fell silent. All eyes were on him.\n\n\"A very good afternoon to the House of Representatives. The House of Peers has given me this special opportunity to give this speech on this auspicious day, which I thank them for deeply. Now, you may be wondering what the platform of this administration is, and how different it will be from the Ino administration.\"\n\nA slight chuckle emerges from the stands, as Ikeda lets out a cough to reassert the room's attention.\n\n\"Moving forth, I seek to guide my administration by these principles: integrity and moderation. Our nation is fundamentally great, and our position could never be more secure, but we have to always take note of the changing tides of the world. Like my colleagues among Admiral Takagi's reformists, I do believe Japan constantly needs reform and advancement to keep our place in the sun.\"\n\nThe reformists among the diet let out a mild applause for a few seconds, before silence engulfs the room again.\n\n\"But, above all I seek to run a clean and honest administration. Ino was a fool, and was rightfully disgraced as one. Some of you are still loyal to Ino's path, and I would not chide you for that - but this administration shall be honest and purged from corruption. With that, I end my speech and cede my time back to the speaker.\"\n\nSilence echoed through the room, as many of Ino's loyalists let this new reality sink in, no matter whether Ikeda actually meant whatever he said.\n\n"
 japikeda.4.d:0 "\"Alright, Takagi-san, what's your proposal.\"\n\nCigar smoke fills the Prime Minister's office as Takagi Sōkichi and Ikeda Masanosuke enter their second hour of negotiation. The leader of the Reformists has made an attempt to reach across the aisle following Ikeda's unspoken request for cooperation against the technocrats. While Takagi considers Ikeda to still be a stain on the government's integrity, he has begrudgingly concluded that Ikeda was far from the worst possible option the Conservatives could field.\n\n\"Look - you know me, Ikeda-san, I don't have many non-negotiables. It's the same things I've always been fighting for in the Diet - clean governance, technocratic principles and curbing the Army.\"\n\n\"Takagi-san, you have to understand that it isn't easy - I personally don't find the idea of army cooperation too attractive either, but you know what they say about eggs and omelettes.\"\n\nTakagi lets out a small grin, but one that's forced enough to show his frustration, \"I'm not here to play games, Masanosuke. You either accept the proposal, or the agreement's off.\"\n\nIkeda is at a crossroads - gaining the Reformists' trust is harder than it seems. He's walking on a tightrope now - if he caves in too much to the Reformists' demands, he'd collapse his own base. If he puts up an uncompromising front, a hundred Diet votes would go up in dust. The only viable path, if the conservatives were to survive, is to tread the middle line.\n\n\"Soukichi, you and I both know that your relevance in the Diet hinges on cooperation too. I'll take up your offer - but know that this is an equal partnership, at the very least.\"\n\nThe two men put out their cigarettes, shake hands and bide each other goodbye. The moderates might triumph after all, thought Ikeda as he observes Takagi entering his limousine from his office window."
 japikeda.5.d:0 "A soft drizzle pours outside, audible enough from Prime Minister Ikeda's personal study. Lit by a small table lamp, the Prime Minister is accompanied by a warm mug of coffee and a pack of cigarettes. Nights like these were made for reading, and tonight, Ikeda is reading the memoirs of Saionji Kinmochi - by far the most influential and domineering figure in the Japanese political scene in the 1920s. For Ikeda, Saionji is the very personification of the ideals he strives for - moderation, conservatism and a respect for the traditional institutions of Japanese power.\n\nOf course, times have changed since the days of the Genrō. The Shōwa era was supposed to herald a new, bright era for Japan - the glory of Asian hegemony was theirs for the taking. Japan had everything it could have ever wanted, but corruption and incompetence has prevented Japan from claiming the spoils of victory. Ino wasn't entirely wrong, Ikeda thought, but his governance was abysmal in practice.\n\nMaybe the House of Representatives was an outdated means of ensuring political domination, and has been mired in so much graft, backroom dealings, and corruption. Maybe it's time to concentrate power in those divinely ordained to do so once more - the nobility. After all, if this pays off, Ikeda's basically untouchable - noble pressure and cajoling is incredibly powerful in getting House of Representative deputies to fall in line.\n\nThe issue is, for Ikeda, is to secure the nobles' support in the first place.\n\n"
 japikeda.6.d:0 "Traditionally, the main financial and economic backers have always been the Zaibatsu. In particular, the Big Four families of Yasuda, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo have always been entangled with Japan's political conservatives - from the Rikken Seiyuukai to the Rikken Minseito. Even in the aftermath of the formation of the Taisei Yokusankai, the Yokusankai's centre has always been backed by the financial might and historical ties to the mega-corporations. However, this has changed in the aftermath of the Yasuda collapse, an event that will change the face of the Japanese economy forever.\n\nPrime Minister Ikeda has always had strong ties to corporations, and this has not seemed to cease upon his ascension to Prime Ministership. Recently, the remaining three of the old four families have approached his administration for negotiations regarding the continuation of his term under their rule. In particular, the three families have approached Ikeda separately regarding the aftermath of Yasuda's collapse - with Sumitomo in particular being the most aggressive in negotiating for the scraps of Yasuda. Ikeda however, is not an idiot. Favour begets another favour, and his terms are simple: Financial backing for his political campaigning, and a promise to restructure accordingly to the new needs of the economy.\n\nThe corporations are in flux upon receiving such demands. On one hand, it is a guarantee of their old alliance with the conservative centre of Japanese politics. On the other hand, restructuring is an incredibly tiresome and gruelling task that may not guarantee dividends. Sumitomo however, has already wholeheartedly accepted Ikeda's proposal - considering the mega-corporation was already in the middle of restructuring when Yasuda collapsed."
 japikeda.7.d:0 "\"So, you've sidelined the reformists this quickly. That's impressive, Ikeda-san. I certainly didn't expect that coming from such an... inexperienced lad like yourself.\"\n\nIkeda felt a tinge of offense when Hatoyama disparaged him, but held back his tongue in front of an elder. Hatoyama after all, was already part of the Diet since 1915 - seeing it all, living through it all. Though he has every urge to bark back at the old conservative, he resists. Of course, Hatoyama notices his body language - but does not say a word.\n\n\"Thank you, Hatoyama-sama. It was a struggle, but playing off the Reformists against the corporations was pretty effective at shutting them down.\"\n\n\"Genjitsu Seiji Keikaku, young man.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, I don't quite get your drift.\"\n\n\"Realpolitik. Play your enemies against each other, they don't even notice you're gliding above them the whole time.\"\n\nIkeda was of course, no stranger to the games of Realpolitik. He himself was a \"faction-jumper\". In the eyes of many in the Diet, jumping across factions in the Yokusankai is akin to dishonour and betrayal - something many independents accused Ikeda of being when he joined the Yokusankai in the late 1940s. However, their protests were just hot air, as Ikeda rose to ministerial positions throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, and even moreso now when he has become Prime Minister."
 japikeda.8.d:0 "\"Good morning gentlemen, it's good to see you all again. It'd be great if we got to the point of this meeting so Hatoyama-san, please address the agenda.\"\n\nFacing Ikeda Masanosuke is his cabinet - largely veterans of the Diet, and some new, fresh faces. Most important were Satō Eisaku, Sakurauchi Yoshio, Ezaki Masumi, and Hatoyama Ichirō - important moderates, and trusted, non-corrupt deputies from the Ino era. Ikeda has worked for and against members of this cabinet in the past, but what's done is done. What matters now is the formation of a strong, unified front - opposition be damned.\n\n\"Thank you, Daijin-sama: Regarding the governmental situation, we have a stable mandate over the Lower House. However, the Upper House is an entirely different story. Trust is important, especially given how Ino threw away their faith in the Diet moderates.\"\n\nIkeda knows that swaying the nobles and the Peers would be an uphill struggle, that uptight bastard Kido be damned. Unfortunately, Ikeda's mandate relies on their support - if Kido is left alone to lobby the House of Peers, passing legislation would be difficult, if not impossible.\n\n\"What about the Kazoku? Can they be convinced?\" interjected Ikeda.\n\n\"Daijin-sama, lobbying the Kazoku would be inadvisable: if they even think that we're pressuring or cajoling them, we're dead.\"\n\n\"We're not going to pressure them - it'd be more like, 'appealing to their better natures'. Either this works, or our administration will be dead in the water.\" Ikeda knows the risks, but decades of parliamentary wrangling has made him bold enough to take the fight upwards. The lines between the conservatives and the Kazoku would finally be crossed, and there's little chance to turn back once it has been done."
 japikeda.9.d:0 "The front porch of the Kantoku-Tei was neatly covered by a line of black Toyota limousines - the distinct mark of government officials. Tonight, the tea house is at peak capacity, and Ikeda Masanosuke is the man of the night. While there may be suspicions that Ikeda is trying his hand at House of Peers politicking, Ikeda is ostensibly holding this meeting to formalise his appointment as Prime Minister, at least within the House of Peers.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I would like to congratulate our new Prime Minister, Ikeda-san upon his inauguration. To the prosperity of his administration, and to the prosperity of Japan.\"\n\nAll smiles and raised tea glasses across the room, followed by the applause of the nobles. Even though he's seated like everyone else, the ambience beckons Ikeda to step up onto the metaphorical podium. This is his chance - fix Ino's fuck-ups, and impress the nobles.\n\n\"Thank you, and it is an honour to have tea with all of you esteemed gentlemen of the Dōseikai. It's a shame that the previous administration left us in such a... dire situation. I trust that I will be able to carry the torch of our elders - the legacy of the Minseitou will not be tarnished. Moving forth I seek to have a cordial understanding of my cabinet's interests, and the Dōseikai's. I also seek for us to move forward together into an era of prosperity and business, free from corruption.\"\n\nShit.\n\nWhat did Hatoyama say? Never cajole or pressure the nobles. That doesn't matter now, Ikeda has a split second - one that will determine whether the Dōseikai will support him, or leave him to the dogs.\n\nIkeda's slight fear turns into a jubilant smile as the nobles lay down their glasses for a round of applause. The backing is set. Two down, two more cliques to go.\n\n"
 japikeda.10.d:0 "The Diet of Japan is a treacherous snakepit, filled with crooks, opportunists and alliances of convenience. Unfortunately, Ikeda Masanosuke's political credibility lives and dies by the approval of the Diet. While the House of Peers are stuck up on their high horses, the House of Representatives contains the people who will actually get things done, for good or for ill. Our conservative front now has to choose who to brown-nose, who to keep close, and who to throw under the bus - a roulette between the Reformist, Royalist, and Technocrat factions.\n\nThe Reformist faction, formerly moribund has experienced a return to form during the twilight of the Ino years - no doubt taking advantage of the anti-corruption sentiment among the Japanese public. One could argue that the Reformists are our natural allies: after all, they are moderates - and the conservatives largely differ only in terms of cautiousness to reform. However, allying with the Reformists would cost us the support of the army and the technocrats, in exchange for popular and Imperial navy support.\n\nThe technocrats on the other hand, could be described as technocratic, nationalist étatists at best, and totalitarian, destabilising extremists at worst. Firmly opposed to moderation and caution, they seek to reform and recalibrate the state into a corporatist, arguably totalitarian model: supposedly in the name of the Kokutai, but that claim stands on shaky ground in our eyes. However, we could try and appeal to the moderates within their ranks - taking influence from their corporatist model into ours, and choking them away into Diet irrelevance.\n\nLastly, the royalists. Less of a proper faction and more of Kido Kōichi's personal clique, they seem to be numerically irrelevant. What makes them worth considering though, is their connections with the nobility and most importantly, the Tennō himself. Their relative infirmity when it comes to ideology can be spun to our own gain - we have the numbers to outmuscle them, and they don't."
 japikeda.11.d:0 "\"Fore!\"\n\nThe sun gleams down on the Fuji Golf Course. Frequently patronised by business and political elites, the course is privy to the indiscretions and politicking of the upper crust of Japanese politics, and today is no different. Ikeda Masanosuke has brought along some of the most influential nobles within the Dōwakai, ostensibly a mere game of golf, but nobody is deceived: Ikeda is here to play politics.\n\n\"Excellent, Ikeda-san. So, now that you've become top dog - what's gonna change? How are you different from that fool Ino?\"\n\n\"Well - it's rather easy actually: I see the values of the pre-war conservatives as much as you gentlemen do, and-\"\n\nIkeda's third swing barely missed the hole - but it's close enough for him to sink it in.\n\n\"Where was I? Right - fiscal responsibility, and running a clean ship. Doesn't sound like much, but it's an essential first step.\"\n\n\"Ikeda-san, if I can be frank - Ino's indiscretions don't bother us that much: our concerns lie mostly within his ideal of conservatism. All that we're asking is that you uphold the ideals of the Minseito, and to hell with the Seiyuukai's ideals.\"\n\nIkeda knows the foolishness and how badly out-of-touch these old nobles were. Japanese conservatism has evolved beyond the Minseito and the Seiyuukai, even under the shadow of the Yokusankai. However, he knows that he has to play to their basal natures, and so he holds his tongue.\n\n\"You can trust that I can rein in Hatoyama-san - and his Seiyuukai remnants,\" says Ikeda as he sinks the ball into the hole."
 japikeda.12.d:0 "The House of Peers is, as already established, the upper house of Japan's bicameral legislature as set by the Meiji Constitution. Constitutionally, it also acts as a counterbalance to the House of Representatives through its ability to veto any bill or act that passes through the House of Representatives, even in the face of a parliamentary majority. Any politician that does not earn the favour of the House of Peers is a dead man, doomed to a premiership of vetoes and blocked legislation.\n\nIkeda Masanosuke has been planning his next move against the House of Peers for weeks now. He has secured the remnants of the Minseitou in the form of the Dōwakai and the Dōseikai, but it was inherently easier to win their appeal - after all, Ikeda represents the moderates in the Diet, as well as having a steady following of former pre-war conservatives. Now that he has a foothold in the House of Peers, he is ready to go above and beyond.\n\nThe next move would be petitioning for the House of Peers' stamp of appeal. An incredibly powerful tool in Japanese politics, it can only be bestowed by the House of Peers - for the obvious reason of it being able to grant access to the Privy Council, the only body able to revise the Japanese constitution and give political counsel to the Tennō himself.\n\nIkeda knows that this requires more than mere dinners and golf outings. He needs a plan, and a thorough one at that. If those plans could be drafted as soon as possible, he has the necessary momentum. Factionalism is on his side: he has a majority in the Diet, as well as having a reputation for being a moderate. Only time will tell if he is able to actually win the nobles over - or perish."
 japikeda.13.d:0 "Akiyoshi Toshiko's mellow jazz piano plays in the background of the Prime Minister's office. At 3 a.m., Ikeda and Hatoyama are often the only people left in the building, barring the nightwatchman. Sometimes, Satō would join them for post-supper politicking, but not tonight.\n\n\"So, what do you think?\"\n\n\"It's not the way I would've done it - but I'm impressed,\" said Hatoyama, with a tone of slight approval.\n\n\"Believe me, Ichirō-san: I'm honestly almost sick of tea and golf - but for the sake of our administration, and our careers, I think I can go for another round of both.\"\n\nIt's not a conventional approach, but Ikeda's tour through the Kazoku nobles, as well as the Dōwakai and Dōseikai factions has paid off: he has secured their backing, at least for the remainder of this term. Most important of all, Ikeda has secured access to the Privy Council - an achievement unparalleled since the days of Kido's ministership.\n\n\"So what now, Ikeda-san?\"\n\n\"Next time we meet, we're going to have to discuss surging the Diet. The old families are breathing down my neck for god's sake, they want their corporate relief and they want it fast. Not to mention, there's Kishi left to deal with.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a topic for another day. Thank you for the supper, Ikeda-san - I owe you one for next Friday.\"\n\nThe two men said their goodbyes and pleasantries, and entered their respective gleaming black Toyota limousines."
 japikeda.14.d:0 "Ikeda Masanosuke, Ezaki Masumi, and Satō Eisaku are seated in the Prime Minister's office. Of note, Hatoyama Ichirō is not present - ostensibly due to Ikeda assigning him to represent the Prime Minister at a railroad opening ceremony in Tohoku. Coincidentally, today is the day that Ikeda chose to begin a more radical approach in lobbying the Kenkyūkai - the think tanks and the research groups of the Japanese Empire, a move Hatoyama would disagree with for being too radical.\n\n\"Gentlemen - sorry to call you up at such short notice but we've got an important matter left to deal with. Now, I'm sure all of you are familiar with the Kenkyūkai - those of you close to academia would know better than I do, but we've got to lobby them in our favour.\"\n\nThe Kenkyūkai are, in fact, research groups: the think tanks of the Japanese Empire. Acting as a quasi-advisory body to policy-making, they've transformed into a sizable contender for influence - receiving backing from officially \"non-partisan\" actors is a credibility boost for any administration.\n\n\"Ikeda-san - if I may interrupt, lobbying the Kenkyūkai isn't as easy as it sounds. You've got the old fogeys who want to uphold nobility above all, and you've got the new-fangled reformists - we've got to side with one over the other!\" chided Masumi.\n\n\"I think gentlemen, it's time for us to go on another charm offensive.\"\n\nIkeda's cabinet agreed resoundingly to the lobbying plans - but were bickering over which faction of the Kenkyūkai the administration should side with. The rest of the evening was filled with phone calls and letter drafts for tennis and golf court reservations, country club dinners, tea house scheduling, and horseback riding bookings.\n\n\"Hatoyama may not like this, but I'd be damned if he isn't impressed by this charm offensive,\" Ikeda thought to himself."
 japikeda.15.d:0 "The sound of wooden Kendo swords clashing fill the air in the Kyoto Budo. Today, the centre for martial arts is hosting a special guest - Prime Minister Ikeda has come down from Tokyo for several days of friendly jousting and fraternizing with the Kenkyūkai's populists. Ikeda is accompanied by Satō Eisaku, who has also recently developed a renewed interest for the finer things in life.\n\n\"Ikeda-san, you're up next. Don't get your old bones broken, eh?\"\n\n\"I assure you Satō-san, these old bones haven't seen their twilight.\"\n\nThe announcer calls for Ikeda's name, and Ikeda puts on his protective armour as he heads down to the ring.\n\n\"Gentlemen, the round begins in 10 seconds. Ready your swords.\"\n\nThe cries of both men's kiai and the ritualistic steps before striking echo through the hall, before Ikeda's opponent lands a point through a strike on his chest. Point one goes to the populist.\n\nIkeda must renew his strategy - play in moderation, let your opponent come towards you, put up a stalwart defense. The second round begins, and Ikeda is almost struck in the chest again, before letting his opponent overextend and striking him on the side of his head. Point two goes to Ikeda.\n\nThe final round begins, and Ikeda knows his opponent hasn't learned a thing. Feign a strike, withdraw. Feign a strike, withdraw. \"Get his guard down, let him think you're a fool\", Ikeda thought to himself. His opponent lunges for the chest again, but Ikeda parries him away - and wins the final point courtesy of a straight strike onto his torso.\n\n\"Now, young man, do you see the value of moderation?\"\n\nThe populist nods his head in approval as the audience applauds and Ikeda extends a hand to his defeated opponent."
 japikeda.16.d:0 "OSAKA (YOMIURI SHIMBUN)\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Ikeda Masanosuke arrived in Osaka yesterday morning for a Taisei Yokusankai rally at Tennoji Park. Accompanying him from his cabinet were Minister of Finance Satō Eisaku, as well as noted deputy Horikiri Zenjiro, from the House of Peers. Observers have noted Zenjiro's presence as a sign of collaboration between the Conservatives and the Reformists within the Yokusankai, which is a sign of the new Prime Minister's ever-strengthening mandate.\n\nIn the blistering afternoon sun, the Prime Minister made an impassioned speech about the necessity of moderation, clean governance and resilience in the face of external and internal threats. He also has urged the citizens of Osaka to participate in their political system, as he has been quoted to have said:\n\n\"Lastly, the most important thing you can do is vote! Vote out the deputies you're displeased with! Vote for those who truly represent your interests! Vote for those who are capable! And by God, we will bring forth a new era for Japan, under the banner of the Yokusankai.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister's impassioned speech about the necessity of political participation has brought up several interesting perspectives from television and radio political punditry. Some have called his speech a direct attack on the Kokutai, a reformist plot to undermine Japanese national harmony. Others have lauded his efforts at setting Japan back to the path of civilian rule, especially elders who look upon the Taishou era fondly. Though, only time can tell whether the Prime Minister is a true servant of the state, or is he merely co-opting populist and potentially dangerous rhetoric for his personal political gain."
 japikeda.17.d:0 "Ikeda Masanosuke and Satō Eisaku convening with a particularly reformist current within the Kenkyūkai - one of Japan's many think tanks, dedicated to policy creation, and containing some of the brightest minds in all of Japan. The air in the room is palpably tense, as this particular Kenkyūkai and the conservative establishment within the Yokusankai has clashed multiple times when it came to policy making. Yet, Ikeda is here - to set things right, and to gain another political ally.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I must apologise for our frequent bouts of... vehement disagreement in the past - which is why I am here to discuss a new shift for our public policy,\" Ikeda elucidated to an unimpressed audience. \"The previous administrations, Ino-sama's one in particular, have made the mistake of totally disregarding public opinion and public participation in policy-making. Well, from this day on forth we will be taking a new shift - a public-oriented one, to policy making.\"\n\nIkeda outlined his planned reforms to political participation. A committee for the deliberation on the issues of women's, Korean and Taiwanese suffrage was to be formed, as well as the promotion of ministerial task forces to head into rural districts and allow for Japanese citizens to voice out their concerns. The liberal intellectuals weren't too impressed - hell, that should have been the bare minimum, but it was a step forward nonetheless."
 japikeda.18.d:0 "Diplomacy often requires a person to say one thing while meaning another, and rarely has that ever been more true than it is for Prime Minister Ikeda right now.\n\nAs he sits across the lacquered table from the Emperor's courtiers, watching the fine china dishes catch the light, he considers each statement with care. Every sentence is parsed for both its obvious meaning and its hidden implications before being set before the Court like a letter in a sealed envelope, waiting for the recipients to break the seal and open the message within.\n\n\"My thanks for agreeing to sit with me for this fine meal. I am glad to see you appreciate the importance of building a rapport between the Court and the Diet,\" he says with a winning smile.\n\nTranslation: \"Well, you've shown that you're willing to play the game, and you didn't slam the door in my face. Now what?\"\n\n\"Of course, it is our pleasure. We are committed, as we hope you are, to maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship between our two branches of the government,\" says a courtier, matching his outwardly friendly demeanor.\n\nTranslation: \"We're trying to figure out whether you plan to help us or throw us under the bus.\"\n\nIkeda's pleasant expression does not change. \"That is good to hear. I understand that recent events have caused some unfortunate turmoil in this area, but I assure you all that this temporary rough patch will soon be smoothed over.\"\n\nTranslation: \"I know you're wary of me, and I'm not exactly enamored of you either, but I plan to work with you anyway.\"\n\nAnother courtier sets down his silverware and speaks up. \"We look forward to seeing what progress you can make on that front. It is good to have a Prime Minister who understands the importance of reaching out to the Court; after all, this government is composed of many parts of which the Diet is but one.\"\n\nTranslation: \"Even if we don't entirely trust you, we know you're our best option, so we'll accept your offer of support.\"\n\nThe seals have been broken, the messages sent. The rest of the dinner is merely a formality. Concealing his satisfaction with a respectful bow, Ikeda soon takes his leave. Only after he has long left the Court behind him does he allow his grin of triumph to show as he thinks over what was not said."
 japikeda.19.d:0 "\"In this tumultuous time, we would do well to take a moment to remember the greatest among us: the men who hold Japan upon their shoulders.\n\n\"The Kazoku are a bulwark of Japanese tradition and culture. In fact, they have been so ever since their creation. Combining the spirit of the samurai with the noble blood of the daimyos at the Emperor's command, they serve as an example to all of us of how to navigate the chaos of these last months with courage and honor.\n\n\"But it is not just their example that makes them irreplaceable. Their efforts help to ensure that the government is run smoothly, efficiently, and in accordance with the will of the Emperor. Without them, we would undoubtedly face chaos in short order. Let us repay the sacrifices they have made for us with loyalty and respect.\"\n\nIkeda's typewriter clatters rapidly as he prepares to submit a new opinion piece. It is little more than propaganda, in truth, a barely-restrained paean to the Kazoku. But much of the support of the conservative faction rests upon him praising the nation's traditional institutions, and so it is propaganda he writes without a word of complaint. A Prime Minister's work, after all, is never done.\n\n\"The Kazoku had better be bloody grateful,\" he thinks to himself sardonically."
 japikeda.20.d:0 "The hall in which the House of Peers goes about the affairs of state is little different from that of the House of Representatives. But to the men who sit in it, it has always had an air of class about it, an intangible power that sets its noble members apart from--and above--the ordinary men who make up the lower House.\n\nTherefore, it is only natural (Ikeda tells the Kazoku) that they should be consulted on the major issues of the day. Their traditional role as one of the steady pillars of the Japanese state will be maintained under an Ikeda administration, and the natural balance of power will proceed into the future undisturbed.\n\n\"Of course, if our fortunes are to be tied together in such a way,\" Ikeda continues, \"it will be in the best interests of all the Kazoku to throw their support behind our bills. The last thing any of us wants is for your backing to evaporate should our government fall to Kaya, or worse, Takagi.\"\n\nIt is an unusually blunt overture by the standards of anyone so deeply involved in politics, almost bordering on a threat--but it suits his purposes. The Kazoku will expect such a lack of refinement from a commoner, and his words play into their image of him, reassuring them that they have nothing to fear from an uncouth peasant.\n\nIt matters little to Ikeda what they think of him, so long as he can count on their votes when the time comes."
 japikeda.21.d:0 "My club takes pride in catering to Japan's most elite, and few are more elite than Prime Minister Ikeda.\n\nSeeing him walk through the doors always promises an interesting day ahead, because his visits to the Koyo Club give me the privilege of an inside look into the day-to-day tasks of running our nation. His guests of honor are different every time: his fellow parliamentarians, diplomats, nobles of the Kazoku, and more. They come in and sit at the same table every time, order a drink or a light meal, and soon get down to business.\n\nAnd every so often, he'll make one of them a promise.\n\nMake no mistake; these are not grand gestures of undying respect. They are small, simple things--an amendment to a bill, a line item in a budget, a minor contract for a Zaibatsu, or some other bureaucratic detail whose significance mostly escapes me. But they rarely fail to put a smile on the other man's face, and garner in return a promise of his own, whose substance is always the same: loyalty and support for Prime Minister Ikeda and the conservative faction.\n\nWith every glass of sake I serve, the Prime Minister's web of promises and allies ties the country more tightly together.\n\nOf course, being in this position makes me privy to more than a few secrets of how Prime Minister Ikeda goes about his work. Were I to reveal them, more than a few of Japan's most prominent figures would see a sudden and extremely rapid downturn in their career prospects...\n\n...but that would be ungentlemanly."
 japikeda.22.d:0 "Tsukamoto Shoji was one of the many monks working to prepare the Meiji Jingu shrine for the visit on that day. It was certainly a significant visit, as Prime Minister Ikeda had never previously been to the Shrine. Tsukamoto had heard that he was not much of a religious man, only visiting shrines for publicity and out of political necessity. Still, it was better than never visiting, or the monk felt. A visit by the Prime Minister was important, and was bound to ensure the Shrine received plenty of donations. With everything in order ahead of schedule, Tsukamoto gathered with his fellow monks to await the Prime Minister\n\nIt was easy enough to tell when the Prime Minister was nearing Meiji-Jingu. Although he traveled on foot through the majority of Shibuya's Yoyogi Park, the sounds of reporters and photographers made his presence known a good few minutes before he appeared in person before the assembled Temple monks. The Prime Minister, grinning as if meeting old friends, quickly performed the appropriate formalities before the Head Monk began to guide him around the Shrine. Tsukamoto could not help but notice that the Prime Minister had walked just a bit too quickly, only slowing down to a respectable pace when walking alongside the Head Monk. Once the tour of Meiji-Jingu was complete, the procession headed inside to hear Prime Minister Ikeda speak.\n\nTsukamoto found himself a place to sit at the back of the room, and began to listen to the Prime Minister. \"As monks of this shrine, you are the representatives of the morality and spirituality of Japan. You provide a vital service to this nation, one that each and every one of us deeply needs.\" Tsukamoto noted how loud the Prime Minister was, which was only emphasised further by his hyperbolic gestures. \"As your Prime Minister, I am sworn to defend your services, and to ensure they remain a cornerstone of society. I assure you, that my administration is committed to tradition and morality. I thank you for allowing me to take time out of your days to accommodate my visit and that the donation I make goes a long way in aiding this grand shrine.\" Upon once again performing the expected formalities, Prime Minister Ikeda was immediately surrounded by his entourage of guards and assistants as he departed from Meiji-Jingu. Tsukamoto felt somewhat disappointed by the visit, and thought about it much for the rest of the day. He eventually realised that one thing was certain, Ikeda was not a man who often visited shrines."
 japikeda.23.d:0 "Citizens flocked to their televisions today to witness the first television broadcast of the celebration of Emperor Meiji's birthday. Emperor Meiji was a pioneer in many means, revolutionising the Japanese State away from its backwards feudal roots, and a pioneer of the sciences and technological advancement. Today, Ikeda has the honour of speaking to the nation on television, courtesy of the technological advances made by state broadcaster NHK.\n\n\"Citizens, loyal subjects of the Tennō, I bid you a very good morning. Today is an auspicious day for all of us, and even moreso for the divine Emperor Meiji in the heavens above.\"\n\nIkeda puts down his script, before continuing his speech freely.\n\n\"Nearly a hundred years ago today, our most venerable Emperor Meiji began the glorious Meiji Restoration, a process which saw Japan advance from being a backwards, picked-upon nation, to the glorious state we have today. In more aspects than one, we owe so much to his Divinity.\"\n\nThe cameraman signals to Ikeda that he is running out of time - only two minutes left on the clock.\n\n\"Emperor Meiji remains this administration's single greatest inspiration in politics - his values of a strong, educated, forward-thinking Japan resonates with everyone in government today, and we will continue to forward that vision as much as possible. With this, I bid you farewell, fellow citizens and loyal subjects of the Tennō, and may the heavens bless Emperor Meiji on this sacred day.\""
 japikeda.24.d:0 "It had been the first time in a long while that Prime Minister Ikeda Masanosuke had had to travel far to meet with members of the Kazoku. These particular figures were of a different stock, and it would require a show of humility on Ikeda's part. Led by Shimazu Tadashige, the Shimazu family had ruled the province of Satsuma for a great number of centuries. Their powerful positions in the House of Peers had made them valuable potential allies for Ikeda Now, Ikeda stood before the Shimazu family estate. Once the formalities had been concluded, which the Prime Minister was careful to properly respect, Ikeda and the heads of the Shimazu family sat down for a most traditional dinner.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I am honored to have been invited here to meet and dine with you. I have experienced nothing but excellence since I arrived.\" While this was indeed his usual manner of conducting business, the somewhat austere mood had made Ikeda more subdued. He was more comfortable in the smokey and relaxed clubs of Tokyo, where conversation was loud and the drinks were bottomless. Still, he continued to speak to the severe men seated in front of him. \"As leaders of the Shimazu clan, you are important voices in the House of Peers, voices that I always take into consideration.\" The looks of the Shimazu clan leaders did not change, but Ikeda had expected nothing more from an old samurai clan. \"However, I have in truth come here to ask of you an extraordinary favour. I believe that we are aligned in our views regarding the future of Japan. Therefore, I propose that we form an alliance in the House of Peers, to further both of our interests.\" The Shimazu leaders convened among themselves for a while, with the same facial expressions as before. A good five minutes passed, leaving Ikeda plenty of time to sample the sake. \"Prime Minister, we appreciate the offer you have brought before us, as well as the subsidies for our Shimazu Kosan company. We will need more time to commune with the rest of the family, but we think you should have your alliance formalised within the week.\" Ikeda performed his best humble bow and spent the rest of the evening in smug contemplation."
 japikeda.25.d:0 "TOKYO (YOMIURI SHIMBUN)\n\nA solemn affair enveloped Yasukuni Shrine today as the Deputy Prime Minister, Hatoyama Ichirō visited the grounds today in honour of Japan's dead soldiers. The weather seems to have matched the somber nature of the event as it rained throughout the whole event, forcing the event to head indoors into a prayer hall.\n\nCoat drenched from the rain, the 83-year old left the prayer hall silent as he talked about the necessity of wartime sacrifice, which he himself had seen and went through as a young man. Of particular note is a 30-minute private prayer in one of the Shrine's many halls. Yomiuri Shimbun were declined comments from the Deputy Prime Minister, but we would like to give Deputy Hatoyama our most heartfelt congratulations for dedicating time out of the busy schedules of governance to bless the spirits of those who have given their lives for Japan.\n\nOf course, the Deputy's visit to the shrine has been met with criticism from radical left-wing student activists, who call him a continued propagator of Japanese imperialism throughout East Asia. Our correspondents were able to obtain comments from the Minister of Education, who believes that the criticism towards the Co-Prosperity Sphere was caused by an influx of American smear campaigns, and will be looking towards disciplinary action towards these students."
 japikeda.26.d:0 "The Hirobumi shrine is far from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The cacophonous noise of the city is replaced with birdsong and the soft rush of water flowing over rocks. The bright neon lights give way to the shade of cherry trees. It's a quiet, peaceful place, suitable to clear the mind and purify the soul.\n\nBut Ikeda Masanosuke isn't at peace even here.\n\n\"Kami of the earth and sky, of day and night, of my ancestors and my Emperor,\" he prays, \"give me the strength to carry this immense burden that has been placed on my shoulders. Give me the wisdom to see my task through to its end. Give me the cunning to convince my adversaries that they have strayed from the path.\"\n\nHe pauses, wondering if perhaps he's asked too much.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he says finally, \"if I have placed too many demands on you. It is not my place to be so greedy with the spirits. But I must press on. It is the only way... all others lead to disaster. So I have no choice but to ask this of you. Please help me save the Kokutai.\"\n\nHis face suddenly seems to age decades as he speaks, and with his final words, his voice drops into a weary whisper.\n\n\"Please help me save Japan.\"\n\nThe rustle of the wind through the cherry trees is his only reply."
 japikeda.27.d:0 "\"So, what now, Ikeda-san? You've beaten back the nobles and the elites - how are you feeling about finally wrangling in the Diet?\"\n\nIkeda at this point was unbothered by Hatoyama disparaging his relative inexperience and age. What does he know at this point? Hatoyama could barely rise to party leadership in 50 years in the Diet, while Ikeda has achieved party leadership in 20 years. Ikeda of course, held his tongue - Hatoyama's support is still critical to the old guard of the Yokusankai, as well as nobles familiar with Hatoyama as their conduit within the Diet.\n\n\"Well, Hatoyama-sama, it was hard, but you just have to know when to make the right promises - and when to break them.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you'll do fine, but the House of Representatives is another story. I'm too old to keep up with what goes on. Hell, I've been in the Diet longer than that brash fool Takagi was even in the Navy!\"\n\n\"Experience doesn't come merely in years, Hatoyama-sama: it's what you do with those years.\"\n\nTaken slightly aback, but also impressed at Ikeda's backhanded comment, Hatoyama slowly starts to realise the capabilities of the young firebrand. Even though he was still relatively young, and still made foolish decisions from time to time, he knew how to handle himself in difficult situations. Not many people managed to bridge the gap between the Kazoku nobles and the Diet - that was on the tier of Ito Hirobumi."
 japikeda.28.d:0 "When Hatoyama Ichirō walks into the Prime Minister's office, he knows right away that the time has come for them to go on the attack.\n\nIt's hard to say what exactly makes him realize this. Maybe it's the sense of tension in the air, so thick that Hatoyama can practically feel it in his ancient bones. Maybe it's the gleam in Ikeda's eye, signalling that his legendarily fiery ire is about to be unleashed. Or maybe it's just that he knows that Ikeda thinks he's been playing cautiously for far too long.\n\nWhatever the reason, Hatoyama finds himself utterly unsurprised when Ikeda says, \"It's time to discuss our next target.\"\n\nThe veteran minister nods, but replies, \"We'll have to choose our play with care. You know as well as I do how precarious your position is. I understand your desire to permanently defeat your opposition, but if you damage your own supporters in such a maneuver it could spell the end of your ministry.\"\n\n\"Don't remind me,\" Ikeda mutters, face twisting into a frown. \"A focused strike, then. Not an attack against a whole faction--some sort of targeted scheme, meant to diminish the influence of a few key figures. Take out the foundation and collapse the whole structure.\"\n\nHatoyama raises an eyebrow. \"Are you talking about securing your political position or assaulting a fortress?\"\n\n\"Very droll,\" Ikeda says, but his tone makes it clear that he has no time for dry wit. \"In any case, that answers the 'how'. The next question is 'who'. If we're directing our attention so narrowly, we'll have to make sure we're discrediting only the greatest threats to my ministry.\"\n\n\"You seem to have already formed an opinion on who they are,\" Hatoyama observes."
 japikeda.29.d:0 "\"Unacceptable!\"\n\nSatō Eisaku's exclamation echoes even in the small confines of the meeting room, such is the passion in his voice.\n\nIkeda, by contrast, is deceptively calm--an untrained listener might perceive him to be unruffled, but every one of his cabinet members knows him too well for that.\n\n\"Choose your next words very carefully, Minister Satō,\" he warns.\n\nSatō seems to realize he's overstepped, and he shrinks back a little bit, settling back into his chair. But his jaw is still clenched with anger.\n\n\"We must do this, Eisaku,\" Hatoyama tells him. \"I understand that you and Kishi are close, but there is simply too much at stake to let the Technocrats go unchecked. The Prime Minister understands this, which is why he's decided to accept my suggestion to put Kishi under arrest.\"\n\n\"You know my misgivings have never stopped me from standing by either of you before,\" Satō says. \"But this...this is different. Attacking Kishi is a bridge too far. I'm surprised you'd even consider asking me to support you against my own brother.\"\n\nDespite the fact that Ikeda is still seated, he seems to loom over his compatriots, and the evening light from outside casts his shadow in sharp relief over the tan cedarwood of the conference table. \"I'm not asking you to do anything,\" he replies. \"I'm telling you what will happen. Your options are to accept it, or to no longer be a member of this cabinet.\"\n\nSatō genuinely considers the second of those options for a moment. But his own position in the Diet has always been precarious--thanks in large part to the very brother Ikeda is now proposing to attack. Even if he defects to another faction, he'll be distrusted and sidelined there, unable to make nearly as much of a difference as he does in Ikeda's cabinet.\n\nHe knows all this... and Ikeda knows he knows it.\n\nWith a defeated sigh, Satō slumps back in his seat. \"Fine,\" he says bitterly. \"But the least you can do is not to make me a part of your plans for Kishi. It's bad enough that I'm having to sit by while you target him--don't ask me to stab my own family in the back as well.\"\n\n\"Your assistance won't be necessary,\" Hatoyama says. It's not exactly a reassurance, but he offers it all the same.\n\nSatō gives a despondent nod, and with that, his brother's fate is sealed."
 japikeda.30.d:0 "Ikeda can practically smell the fear in the air.\n\nHe has been meeting all day with representatives of the Zaibatsu, from the VIP envoys of the Big Four to the minor functionaries of their lesser counterparts. And every single one of them is nervous.\n\nIt's no wonder, really--with an economic crisis raging and their Technocrat enemies gaining influence in the Diet, it's only natural that the Zaibatsu would turn to Ikeda and his faction for support. But what does come as a surprise is the urgency with which they plead for the conservatives to take action. Some of the requests have been phrased almost as demands, brazen enough to shock even Hatoyama with his decades of experience in politics.\n\nThings must be worse than Ikeda thought if the Zaibatsu are getting this desperate.\n\nVery well, then. If corporate relief and a hard stance against the Technocrats are what they're asking of him, then that is what they shall have. But they'll get it on his terms, and no one else's. The Zaibatsu may be economic powerhouses, but they do not rule Japan, and they certainly do not rule Ikeda."
 japikeda.31.d:0 "Hatoyama enters Ikeda's office to a disconcerting sight.\n\nThe Prime Minister's desk is covered in photographs and files of other members of the Diet, all of them hailing from the opposition factions. Ikeda is poring over them with a fierce grin on his face.\n\n\"I suppose this means it's time?\" Hatoyama asks.\n\n\"It is indeed,\" Ikeda replies, still grinning. \"We've already decided which faction to focus our efforts on. Now, it's just a matter of who among them to purge.\"\n\nHatoyama sits opposite his boss, settling down in a sturdy chair on the other side of the desk. \"You seem oddly excited about this,\" he says. \"Even more than you were when you decided to go on the offensive in the first place.\"\n\n\"Can you blame me?\" Ikeda looks up from his work to address his right-hand man. \"It feels good sometimes to be able to make demands and throw my weight around, rather than walking on eggshells to avoid breaking the great compromise that created this ministry.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can't,\" Hatoyama admits. \"But just because it makes you feel good doesn't obviate the need for--\"\n\n\"For caution and prudence, yes, I know,\" interrupts Ikeda, a note of annoyance creeping into his voice. \"So let us plan how to cautiously and prudently purge our enemies from the Diet.\"\n\nHatoyama leans over the papers, and the wheels of state begin to turn."

 japikeda.33.d:0 "Japan has conquered vast swathes of territory across Asia and the Pacific since its first forays beyond the shores of the Home Islands, but none of the overseas territories it now rules are as valuable to the Dai Tōa Kyōeiken as China.\n\nCovering millions of square miles and home to a population of hundreds of millions, it dwarfs Japan's other dominions in every possible measure. It is full of abundant resource deposits of all kinds, barely utilized by the undeveloped Republic but now tapped to their fullest extent by Japanese interests. It is home to the lion's share of the Sphere's industry outside the Japanese archipelago itself, the product of fifteen years' worth of investment in its economy and an increasingly close integration between the Chinese and their overlords.\n\nBut none of these are the reason China must be held at all costs.\n\nThe true reason is this: China is the living, breathing symbol of Japan's greatest triumphs.\n\nBefore even the first war against Russia so many decades ago, the Japanese victory over the decaying Qing showed them to be more than just another \"primitive\" Asian kingdom ripe for colonization. Military advances into China during the Boxer Rebellion and the years following World War I put Japan on par with the world's greatest powers. And finally, the total conquest of all of China during the Second World War completed the creation of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the culmination of Japan's imperial ambitions.\n\nIf China were to be lost, it would seem to many Japanese as if all of those victories were erased in one blow. It would not just take with it its land, its population, its resources, and its industry--it would take Japan's national pride as well. And that, more than anything else, would be a disaster too horrible to contemplate."

Both have their formalities--rank structures, wages, specialties in various fields--but in the end, the function of both had to do only with power.\n\nWhich is why he's not as surprised as one might expect when the Tokkō officers kick down his door.\n\nOf course, that's not to say that he's not furious. As the cuffs are slapped on his wrists, he gives the \"thought police\" a glare he perfected for use on Chinese laborers and peasants. It's a look that conveys to the recipient that Kishi thinks they're the lowest of the low--he looks at them like they're something he scraped off his boot.\n\n\"Does Ikeda really think this will stop me?\" he snarls at the Tokkō.\n\nBut they don't reply. In fact, they don't react at all. Kishi is not in Manchukuo anymore, where his word was law and his writ ran unchallenged. The wheel of history has turned, and for once in his life he has found himself at the bottom of it.\n\nPower is a fickle thing.

Others rant and rave at their captors. Still others just stare in mute confusion even as their wrists are shackled.\n\nBut not a single one escapes.\n\nThrough decades of experience, the Tokkō has become brutally effective at suppressing enemies of the state. It is a matter of no great concern to them that they are arresting the highest-profile opponents of a particular Diet faction. They simply know that they are bringing in men suspected of crimes against the state and Imperial Crown, and that is more than enough for them to carry out their mission with ruthless efficiency.\n\nIt is the culmination of Ikeda's plan for his political foes, and it goes off without a hitch.\n\nThe Thought Police are on the march."

However, as time proceeds onward, the Chinese modernization efforts have brought an interest in government for the subsidization of Chinese companies, to ensure closer cooperation between Chinese and Japanese corporate entities. The Technocrats make fun of the idea, but the reformists and conservatives have come forward with their own suggestions for the subsidy.\n\nThe reformists have suggested far-reaching economic subsidies that would affect nearly every aspect of the Chinese economy, a proposal that is as logical as it is expensive. As an alternative to that, the conservatives have brought forward a plan or subsidies that are more focused on the struggling and newly-growing sections of the Chinese economy. This comes with the caveat of possibly not matching the growth of the reformist plan - while costing significantly less.\n\nNow, these two suggestions present themselves on the Prime Minister's desk.

With the Diet's approval, the Ikeda government has set forth public works projects on the island. In the olden days, the people of Hokkaidō cannot complain that the trains did not run on time - because they did not have many train tracks to begin with. The Ikeda government's investment in the island has ensured that the people there have speedy access to cheap, far-reaching transport.\n\nAlready the opinion polls conducted on Hokkaidō have shown soaring approval for Prime Minister Ikeda.

Starting from its infrastructure.\n\nAside from the mountainous region in its east, the flatlands of its west can use improvement. Roads, trains-lines, as well as urban infrastructure, are included in the public works budgets that the Ikeda government has planned since its switch to favoring the civilian sector instead of the military.

Its deposits of coals and iron ferried every day across the Sea of Japan and to the north into Manchuria, are the engines of the Sphere's industrial sector.\n\nBinding Korea closer to Japan would necessitate the construction of urban and remote infrastructures.

The smoother flow of goods and services from the main islands to Korea would benefit the civilian economy tremendously.\n\nKorea is Japanese, and we shall treat it like the scion of our nation."

 japikedaflavour.1.d:0 "Ikeda was happy to have such jovial guests, though their tastes would run quite a bill for the kitchen staff. He watched as members of the Board of Audit shared stories with an executive from the Nissan group. The gala had gone on for close to two hours, as the Prime Minister mingled with bureaucrats and businessmen alike from Japan at his estate. The bounties of the Pacific were served as dinner, along with a number of fine soups. The atmosphere was perfect, as some men watched as the evening sun began to slip behind the wooded hills.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I'd like your attention please.\" The crowd silenced, and eyes from every corner of the room turned to him. He continued;\n\n\"I am beyond thankful for everyone of you to be present. With your help and contributions, we are the spearhead of a new age of prosperity and strength for our Empire. Our cities are filling with new and grand buildings, and the fears that once plagued us in our lifetimes are left behind. No more do we need to worry about food prices or rubber, or any commodity for the Japanese family.\"\n\nRaising his voice while keeping the same calm and matter-of-fact grace he was famous for, Ikeda raised a toast to the new Japan.\n\n\"Kampai! Enjoy yourselves!\""
 japikedaflavour.2.d:0 "\"Hello, I'd like to speak with Satō-san\". He waited for a few brief seconds before his call was sent through, and greeted with the Economic Minister's voice.\n\n\"So I assume you've called for my opinion on your plans for future industrial buildup, Ikeda-san. I can tell you with certainty that there will be enough in the current budget for any additional expenses this may run into. Perhaps we can work on our contracts with Mitsubishi to hire some extra firms.\"\n\nIkeda smiled a little as Satō-san listed off all the benefits it would bring to Japan's businesses, still hit hard from the Yasuda crash. \"Do you know if we could make this more supportive of businesses? Perhaps providing lower interest on the loans we're giving from the collapse.\"\n\nSatō's face soured, but he informed the Prime Minister it would fit in. It could certainly work, but it could shift the industrial base of the empire away from the loyal Zaibatsu. Perhaps that would be for the better; Mitsui Chemicals was demanding exuberant contracts after a change in leadership."
 japikedaflavour.3.d:0 "\"To the students of Tokyo University, I am proud to see how you have all developed into among the most educated and intelligent of your generation. Regardless of your discipline of study, be proud of your achievements and await your future achievements with rigor. Me, as well as your professors, and all of Japan, are appreciative of your hard work and skills.\"\n\n\"Among the distinguished guests in attendance for today is Satō Eisaku, Minister of Finance for Prime Minister Ikeda Masanosuke.\" The students watched as Satō climbed up to the podium, his bushy eyebrows catching the eyes of some of the more immature graduates.\n\nHe went on to congratulate the students of Tokyo University for their work, extolling them as the pedigree for all Japanese young men and women, and wished them the best of luck in their endeavors, encouraging the students to bring the lessons of their University to wherever they went in their lives, or whoever they met. In turn, he promised, he would work to allocate further money for students, so that all Japanese children could grow to be like them."
 japikedaflavour.4.d:0 "The machine was a marvel of engineering, a train faster than anything the Germans or Americans could dream of. It was one branch, yet the stops would make enough money to pay for the Shinkansen many times over.\n\nAs a show of force, the bullet train was able to travel on its maiden voyage from Osaka to Tokyo in a mere four hours, filled with distinguished guests from the first city who arrived at the latter to greet Prime Minister Ikeda. Japanese television broadcasted at various stations the unbelievable speed of the rail line, with some skeptical citizens calling it little more than advanced film editing.\n\nFollowing the arrival of the first group of passengers, Prime Minister Ikeda promised the Japanese public that this system would be expanded across the islands, to transport people and goods faster and cheaper than ever before. The pocketed cities between the mountains could be reached to and back in less than a day; and soon Korea and Taiwan would have their own rail system. These rails, cried Ikeda, would bring Japan and her allies into closer economic and political friendship."
 japikedaflavour.5.d:0 "The radio hissed its static for a few seconds, before he was able to dial it to the right frequency. Mr. Takasaki enjoyed listening to Radio Nikkei after work; he earned equal to three quarters of his job's salary from the horse races. The apartment room filled with the familiar jingle of the station, before moving to the news segment. He didn't mind much; politics was rarely interesting, and so he often ate his dinner during the host's discussion of the day's events.\n\nApparently the Prime Minister had enough money to build more of those Shinkansen across the colonies. Now Keijō and Taipei and Busan all had the \"Bullet Trains\", as the American and Germans called them. Of course, there was all the usual blubbering from bureaucrats and pundits about how wonderful all of this would be, and what a great step the Empire was taking to bringing all of Asia to the modern world.\n\nMr. Takasaki didn't much care, though the cheaper price for a day at the beach was promising. He remembered going often as a child with his family, now the drudge of work and fretting over the horse jockeys had drained him. He had enough cash to buy a ticket tomorrow, and continued to dine while the sports segment played."
 japikedaflavour.6.d:0 "To His Excellency, Prime Minister Ikeda Masanosuke...\n\nMy name is Yoshigutsu Sawashiro, and I am from Kochi Prefecture before moving to Osaka as a salaryman. I have spent many of my years hard at work, providing for myself, then a wife, then four wonderful children. We now live just outside the city.\n\nWhile the world around me has changed very much, I would find that my job did not. I loved my company, and I am still friends with many there, even as some move up or are fired. I feared that I would not see out my last years, still confined to the office buildings where I have watched the schoolboys ride their bicycles, then take the train to work here.\n\nAnd as such, I cannot appraise your work, Ikeda-sama, for you have allowed this old man to spend his aging years with his family, to rest easy on those cold rainy days, and not worry about company deadlines before my own passing."
 japikedaflavour.7.d:0 "Minister Satō grumbled at the new proposals sent to him from the Prime Minister; a series of new investments put into weapons research and manufacturing. The Empire has no need for another dozen missile cruisers when there's no use for them in the first place! Let the Americans and Germans burn their money, the Empire needs every cent!\n\nHe considered planning a meeting with Ikeda to explain how the project's goals would simply collide with much of the pro-business recovery funding the Prime Minister already set aside, but went against it. Ikeda-san might not be an economic genius, but he was rarely a man to keep insubordination around him. Sighing, he placed it into a locked cabinet, and looked at the clock tick onwards."
 japikedaflavour.8.d:0 "\"So Captain, how's Singapore been?\" asked the Rear-Admiral, relaxing with the other top officers in his Tokyo quarters. The Captain chuckled a little, pouring some sake down his throat from a flask. He knew the new position was miserable, and so was the case for most of the top brass. Prime Minister Ikeda had promised more military spending, but what was the Imperial Navy left doing? The fleet that surpassed the Russians, Americans, and British within a century, and patrolled the greatest ocean in the world? Nothing but damned convoy escorts across Asia.\n\nThe Captain could see the disappointment in his men, day after day of following the shipping lanes from Fukuoka to Shanghai, then a brief stop in Singapore and Dhaka. He had spent years training at the Imperial Naval Academy for actual military work, not this.\n\nThe only good to come from this, it seemed, was the bump in pay from the new budget."
 japikedaflavour.9.d:0 "\"Ikeda-san,\" Satō started, seated before the Prime Minister, and beside Hatoyama, \"I must protest this move towards expanding the military industry. The Emperor knows that we have enough factories that produce weapons already.\" He sighed. \"I do not wish to appear to reproach you, for you have brought us this far. However, I think that this renewed focus is in contrary to what Japan needs at this moment.\"\n\n\"Satō,\" Prime Minister Ikeda began, his voice soft and sympathetic. \"It is all right to correct or even reprimand me. I appreciate your concern. Your advice has been nothing but beneficial to this government. Hatoyama.\" The Prime Minister's head turned to his aging deputy. \"I presume that you are here for the same reason?\"\n\n\"I am, Prime Minister,\" the old man began, his voice cracking under the pressure of his age, \"I do not believe that we should repeat the Konoe administration's mistakes. We are here to govern Japan in peacetime, not a national defense state. Already the new regulation smack of the National Mobilization Law.\"\n\nAn arched eyebrow. \"Thank you, Hatoyama.\" Ikeda turned to regard both men. \"I think that your concerns come from the depths of your heart. However,\" Ikeda held up a finger. \"I must say that we have concerns beyond the civilian economy that keeps us afloat - the army and the navy. We depend on their support. I am afraid that in the face of this, I must reject your advice.\"\n\nBoth Satō and Hatoyama left the Prime Minister's office, head hung in defeat."
 japikedaflavour.10.d:0 "The thrum and shiver of the paver as it crunched the road below it, laying trails of dark asphalt and concrete made its way to Takeyama's post. It was a hot summer day, and the sun was out in full force. Far ahead rose the whitish dust and silhouettes of men bending their backs to construct the foundations for a road. Faint shouting formed an undercurrent to the din. Takeyama was sweating under his uniform, enough to drench his shirt slightly.\n\nPrime Minister Ikeda's government had approved funding for more military infrastructures. The whistle of a train engine brought Takeyama's attention to the brand-new railway leading to his posting. He regarded it favorably: the government was acting in patriotic interests. Takeyama gave the men working on the road and infrastructure some spare cigarettes, and his eyes turned to the rising clouds of dust, and the figures of men, toiling under the baking sun."
 japikedaflavour.11.d:0 "Ezaki Masumi was not someone that the Ikeda government - or indeed anyone in the Diet - could call a PR man. His position was that of the Minister of Security, not the Army or Navy Minister. However, the air force, the budding branch of service free of the traditional Japanese command structure, was under the purview of neither. Thus they chose him to stand on this airfield, a lone government minister among a mob of journalists and shutter-snaps of cameras. The day was hot. The sun-kissed pavements seemed to sizzle and wave in the distance.\n\nThere it was, the prototype. Steadily maneuvering itself out of a hangar, it positioned itself to at the center of the runway, preparing to take off. The journalists and reporters trained their eyes on it, feasting on every detail of the plane. Cameras hungrily snapped its hull and wings, and pens scribbled hypothetical specifications for its engines. Masumi was nervous. He knew that the Prime Minister had tried to dissuade the Zaibatsu from publicly testing their prototypes, but these concerns fell of deaf ears.\n\nThe plane roared and accelerated. It became faster and faster until it was only a blur, and seemed ready to take off into the air when the engines suddenly died. It barely stopped at the edge of the runway. Ezaki covered his face with his right hand. What a disaster. One thing was certain: he would be bombarded by questions right after."
 japikedaflavour.12.d:0 "With grazed and bleary eyes, Yong Hye rose from his bed in the early mornings. He peered at the curtains to his six-tatami room and noted the dark gloom around everything. The sun had not risen yet. Yong Hye was not his name, but it was what his friends call him. At least, when the Kenpeitai were not watching. To the Japanese bureaucracy, and thus to the world at large, his name was \"Hayashi Kuroda.\"\n\nHe stood up, shedding his warm if thin blanket for the cold, early-morning air. Opening the curtains with a swish of his hands, he saw the Incheon steel plant in the distance, melding its shadows with the other buildings in its proximity. That was where Hye worked. A horrible place, full of screeching welders and roaring factory engines: where the Japanese workers wore ear protection, but such expenses were spared the Koreans. Sometimes he could hear his ears ringing - even after he had gone on home, where everything was quiet. It had gotten worse as of late. When he asked for a doctor's prognosis, they answered with \"tinnitus.\" A permanent condition.\n\nHye sighed, the ringing accompanying the gusts of his breath. He did not look forward to the day ahead, but at least he had money and food on the table. Compared to other Koreans, perhaps his life was idyllic. Hye pulled his dresser and selected clothes for the day."
 japikedaflavour.13.d:0 "It was not often that the nobility would travel down to the halls of the House of Representatives. Here they were, however, dressed in suits so sharp they seemed to cut the thin air with their gleam. They were here for the Ikeda cabinet and government's success in managing the state and balancing the interests of the Japanese people. The night was young, but the sake flowed freely from cup to cup. The Prime Minister seemed to drink as well, which confounded some of the cabinet ministers.\n\n\"Congratulations for your success,\" Kido Kōichi offered, seating himself next to the Prime Minister. \"Amazing work. I envy you, Prime Minister Ikeda, for doing so much the Ino ministry could not.\"\n\nA word of praise? From Marquess Kido? It was most peculiar, and Ikeda met his compliments under arched eyebrows. \"It is kind of you to offer,\" Ikeda said. \"But what prompted the friendly overtures, Marquess Kido?\"\n\nKido laughed. \"Graceless and brash as usual. Mind your manners, Prime Minister. Nobles are around.\" Praises, and then mockery. What a puzzling man. \"As I said, enjoy your success, Prime Minister, while you still can. The years ahead of you would look a bit dark.\"\n\n\"Sounds ominous, Marquess.\"\n\n\"From one statesman to another, Prime Minister. Nothing more.\""
 japikedaflavour.14.d:0 "\"Satō-san,\" the technocrat said, \"well done on the government.\" It was the parlor for the Deputies of the Diet, where they met to discuss policy. At lunchtime, it was usually deserted by the other representatives as they ventured out to seek better places to eat in or to fulfill one or two items in their public agenda. Satō would have gone out with a lot of them too, if it were not for the economic file on regulations, stimulus, and the like resting on his lap. The Prime Minister wanted his advice, and soon.\n\n\"Oh.\" The name escaped Satō's mind. He had seen the Deputy before, usually around Kaya, or even worse, Kishi. What business did this technocrat have with him? Surely he could see that they did not have a common ground, either in politics or economics. Satō put aside the melon bread he had been chewing and gulped a sip of water to wash it down. \"How can I help you? I apologize,\" Satō said, rubbing his hands on a handkerchief. \"As you can see, I am rather indisposed.\"\n\n\"How are you, Mr. Satō?\"\n\nFormalities and bromide. \"I am well, thank you. Now, excuse me, I need to get this file to the PM as soon as possible.\" Satō moved to stand. The Deputy gestured for him to stay.\n\n\"Oh no, I don't mean to impose on your time, Satō-san. I am here on behalf of most of the Technocrat Deputies to congratulate you.\"\n\n\"Well, that's very nice of you, but I apologize. I really have to get going.\"\n\n\"Take care, Satō-san!\" What a strange meeting. \"Don't forget your bread!\""
 japikedaflavour.15.d:0 "\"I assure you,\" Prime Minister Ikeda said to the gathering of senior army and navy figures, \"that we shall not compromise the national defense state for the sake of simply improving the economy. On the contrary, my government plans to increase the budget allocated for the military. An increase of...\" Behind the Prime Minister stood two men, the pillars of the Ikeda government: Ichirou Hatoyama and Ezaki Masumi. Satō was elsewhere, attending to the matter of relations with the Zaibatsu.\n\nHatoyama coughed, breaking the monopoly that Ikeda had upon the assembled officers. At the Prime Minister's nod, Masumi led the deputy Prime Minister backstage. \"Are you okay?\" Masumi said, offering a bottle of water, \"that was some severe coughing back there.\" Hatoyama took it with relish, but also fatigue. Unscrewing the cap, he drank deeply, enthusiastically. It almost bothered Masumi. \"Hatoyama-san, you should get that checked. Not to be insensitive, but you are old.\"\n\nHatoyama's bleary, bedraggled eyes turned to Masumi, who seemed to recoil from their stare. \"I am fine. The Prime Minister still needs me, and I shall not rest before he releases me from his service.\"\n\n\"That's dedication and all, but you would be no use to him dead.\"\n\n\"Silence.\"\n\nThey sat in awkward silence until they heard the doorknob open and whined open. \"Hatoyama. Masumi. Tonight was a success.\" Shaking the Prime Minister's hand, Masumi stayed quiet. It was not his business to divulge."
 japikedaflavour.16.d:0 "Jiro Ono's hands moved like a machine's, cutting the fish and shaping the pickled rice of sushi smoothly, one action flowing into one another. Tonight, the guests at his Ginza restaurant were exceptional, but he tried to maintain a semblance of manners. Across from him, in the sushi-bar of Sukiyabashi Ono, seated the Prime Minister of Japan, alongside an entourage of executives drawn from the highest tiers of the Zaibatsu. The low, dimming light (he should have had it fixed a few days ago!) did not diminish the prestige they carried.\n\nWhen the Prime Minister asked for sake, he poured it to the o-sake cups. When he ordered halibut, halibut it was; if salmon, salmon. The Prime Minister cracked jokes and laughed, and Ono laughed alongside him. A man after his own heart, looking for the good of Japan. He could hear snippets of conversation. \"Thank you for being here tonight,\" Prime Minister Ikeda said, \"it has been an honor, managing the country with you.\" The thump on Ono's knife on his board cut it short.\n\n\"No, no,\" one of the executives said, \"We should thank you, Ikeda-sama, for our prosperity.\" The same executive raised his sake cup to the air, inviting all the participants there to raise theirs as well. Ono worked behind the bar, observing the proceedings with earnest interest. \"For lasting prosperity! For Japan!\" They toasted and began ordering their food again.\n\nOno was lucky tonight. Perhaps the Prime Minister would consider recommending his restaurant to the other Diet politicians. In any case, the entourage lavished him with praise: good food and exceptional service. Ono bowed deeply, for it was a great honor."

 JAP_the_reformist_reliance_desc:0 "The admiral and his faction of the Yokusankai have agreed to vote Prime Minister Ikeda's government into confidence. The two men regarded the arrangements as temporary, but perhaps there may be a way to reconcile the reformists and conservatives. After all, their mutual opposition to Kido's power-mongering ways, as well as the Technocrats' brand of extreme Keynesianism, unites them in more ways than one.\n\nOther than ideological concerns, there also exists a pragmatic edge to the alliance. The conservatives have a plurality, but the reformists complete it into a workable majority. Anchoring themselves to Ikeda's vessel, Takagi and his crew have cast their lot as to the fate of Japan.\n\nA step towards cementing this alignment would be to establish a formal understanding with the reformists. They would support conservative programs and policies, but compromises would be arranged wherever possible. There is no more powerful a binding force than a mutual, pressing need."
