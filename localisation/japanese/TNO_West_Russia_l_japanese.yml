 POLITICS_GEORGY_ZHUKOV_DESC: "モスクワの街並みからハルハ川の岸辺まで、レニングラードの郊外から西ロシアの森林まで、彼が戦ったすべての戦場でゲオルギー・コンスタンティノヴィチ・ジューコフは卓越した指導者として同僚や部下から尊敬され、模範として際立っていた。ジューコフは建国以来尊厳と誇りを持って祖国に仕え、フン族の進撃に屈さず、ソ連への誓いも捨てなかった将軍の一人であり、帝国を屈服させる直前まで行った西ロシア革命戦線の主要な将軍の一人でもあった。\n\n戦線は破れたが、それは戦線がファシストの大群に対する聖なる戦いに負けたことを意味するわけではない。戦線は新たに立ち上がる。しかし過去の過ちから学べるだろうか？ジューコフ元帥は共産主義の大義を信奉し、国民が払った犠牲を大きく称賛しているが、一方で戦線組織の効率性に疑問を呈し、ソビエトの指導者は自分たちが代表していると主張していた労働者からあまりにも離れていたのではないだろうかと指摘することすらあった。ジューコフがあまりにも独立した立場にいたため、強硬派の将軍の中には責任者として彼の信頼性や、戦線への忠誠さえ疑問視する者もいた。\n\n彼が政治的に信用ならないという噂はアルハンゲリスクの指導者たちの耳にも届いたが、赤軍の中での彼の権威と庶民の同情は、彼を捨てるにはあまりにも大きかった。他の将軍たちとの不幸な対立の後、彼はウフタ地方へ石油採掘を監督するために派遣され、技術を生かして戦線の政治に影響を与えるために多忙な日々を送っていた。戦線が混乱に陥れば、元帥は座視しないだろう……"
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_TUKHACHEVSKY_DESC: "ミハイル・ニコラエヴィチ・トゥハチェフスキーは、ソビエト最高司令部のメンバーの中では、才能はあるものの、常に風変わりだと考えられていた。元貴族であった彼は、自分の階級に服従せず、古い秩序に対する戦いであるボリシェヴィキ党に参加したのである。勝利に次ぐ勝利、征服した全ての都市を革命とウラジーミル・レーニンのために捧げ、その若さにもかかわらず、「赤いボナパルト」と呼ばれる並外れたキャリアを築いた。\n\nソ連がナチスに敗れた後、トゥハチェフスキーはWRRF指導部の礎となる将軍の一人であったが、我の強い元帥は、ロシアをナチスに敗れさせた同僚たちの弱さと無能さを軽蔑するようになっていった。彼が戦線の政治に影響を与えることを懸念した戦線の指導者たちは、トゥハチェフスキーにプレセツクの小さな領地を与え、アルハンゲリスクの陰謀から逃れ、西からの敵に対する防衛線を構築することができるようにした。\n\nボリシェヴィキの軍事理論家として成熟して以来、革命的な攻撃的戦争を提唱してきたトゥハチェフスキー元帥は、ドイツや日本といった世界のプロレタリアートの敵を宥めようとするブハーリンの試みに長い間反対し、彼の破壊的な軍事複合体の改革に抵抗しようとしたが、ナチスとの戦争の壊滅的な経過の中で、彼の声は耳に届かず、彼の努力は否定されてしまった。ブハーリン政権が、必要とされる革命的な活力と決意なしに、ブルジョア勢力を宥めて打ち負かそうとした失敗例を目の当たりにしたトゥハチェフスキー元帥は、情熱的な戦士として、赤軍を政治変革の主要な道具とする考えをより強く確信した。\n\nもし、トゥハチェフスキーの下でソ連が復活するとしたら、それは数多の敵に対して永遠に警戒し、国家機械のあらゆる歯車を最終的な勝利に向けて回転させている陣営として復活することになるだろう。"
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_ALTUNIN_DESC: "アレクサンドル・テレンティエヴィチ・アルトゥニンは、西ロシア革命戦線の将軍としては、決して誇り高くもなく、注目もされていなかった。民間防衛と兵站の専門家である彼は、大祖国戦争から西ロシア戦争に至るまで、文句を言わずに任務を遂行し、防空や産業調整を組織し、戦線が維持できなくなったときには、東に向かって逃げる難民の列を簡単に殺そうとするドイツ空軍のパイロットから確実に保護した。\n\n戦線が崩壊した後、アルトゥニンは再び秩序ある撤退を組織し、第4軍をアルハンゲリスクに戻して次の指示を待ち、戦線内の派閥や対立に対する防波堤の役割を果たした。アルハンゲリスクでは、エゴロフの側近として、ドイツ軍の爆撃機に対抗するための最初の取り組みを指揮し、バンカーの建設、スィクティフカルとユグラからの食料の確保、自由飛行士との互恵的な取引などを行った。トゥハチェフスキーが前線の盾となり剣となり、ジューコフが士気と産業の支柱となる一方で、アルトゥニンは安定した強さと静かな心を持っている。\n\nこのような静かな有能さと、より非政治的で現実的な性格が、エゴロフの目に留まり、彼は前線の「最も安全」で最も秩序あるリーダーとみなされたアルトゥニンに注目したのである。アルトゥニンは、伝説的な英雄や革命家ではないかもしれないが、真の信者であり、病弱な大元帥が全幅の信頼を寄せる数少ない人物の一人である。"
 WRS.0.t: "エゴロフの死"
 WRS.0.d: "本日、西ロシア革命戦線の指導者であり、ブハーリン政権下の元人民国防委員長であったアレクサンドル・イリイチ・エゴロフ大元帥が老衰のため逝去した。彼は過去数十年間、第三帝国との絶望的な戦いを続けてきた。晩年、エゴロフは、ドイツのテロ爆撃にもかかわらず、西ロシア革命戦線をロシア人民を代表する実在の国家にするために必死に働いてきた－－ゲオルギー・ジューコフとミハイル・トゥハチェフスキーの志のバランスをとり、彼らの協力を維持しようとしていた。\n\n彼らは、エゴロフに忠誠を誓っていた赤軍の残党の中で最も人気のある将軍である。この二人の将軍は自分たちの多くの信奉者を集めていて、今まではエゴロフのために本当にお互いに協力していただけだった。両者は裏で活動しており、戦線のスタフカに影響力を与え、自分たちの視点で前進するよう説得しようとしている。多くの人は、スタフカはすでに候補者を選んでおり、彼を次の指導者として宣言する準備をしていると考えているが、エゴロフの後継者が宣言されたとき、彼らの見解は正しいことが証明された……"

 WRS_initial_enduring_desc: "西ロシア革命戦線は、今日ではロシアの重要でない無名の軍閥国家のように見えるかもしれない。しかし、最近の歴史をよく知っている人ならば、アルハンゲリスクからオルスクまでの戦線がロシアの自由と社会主義の聖火台であった栄光の時代を知っているだろう。しかし、解放の夢は西ロシア戦争とそれがもたらした破壊によって打ち砕かれた。\n\n我々は旧連邦の片隅で孤立し、凍てつく北の地で立ち往生し、アルハンゲリスクを拠点としてきた。1950年代の「敗北」にもかかわらず、WRRFは生き続けている。今、我々は状況を評価し、我々の資源と能力の詳細を見つけ出し、それを最大限に活用する方法を探さなければならない。"
 WRS_the_agriculture_situation_desc: "西ロシア革命戦線の兵士たちは堅実で、労働者たちは勤勉で、指導者たちは大胆で献身的だ。しかし、彼らの胃袋に食べ物がなければ、これらは何の意味もない。戦線結成時には南方から大量の食糧が運ばれてきたが、その食糧が不足し始めている。我々が支配している土地のほとんどは不毛で農業には不向きであり、他の軍閥との貿易の試みを始めたが、ドイツ空軍の爆撃作戦は他の場所から食料を輸入しようとする意味のある試みを挫折させている。もし何かをしなければ、国全体が飢えてしまうだろう。\n\n評議会を招集して戦線の農業状況を評価し、我々の生存のために新たな抜本的な計画を立案しなければならない。我々が持っているどのような耕地であっても、農業に専念しなければならず、新たな貿易取引を行わなければならず、今後数日の間に一度でも食事を摂るためには、配給はきつく引き伸ばされなければならない。"
 WRS_ration_calculations_desc: "西ロシア戦争が終わり、南方の反動派と反逆者の反乱が起きた後、戦線は現在、白海沿岸とその周辺だけに勢力を維持している。我々はこのような困難な年に耐えてきたが、北の生活は欠点がないわけではない。配給制でこれまでの食料は持ちこたえたが、いつまで続くかは誰にもわからない。\n\n食糧備蓄の逼迫を緩和するためには、配給制度を変えなければならない。より平等で科学的な配給制度に改革する。将校たちがカロリーに基づいて配給を計算し、前線の忠実な兵士たちに一日を生き抜くための最低限の配給を与えるのだ。これは辛く不相応な重荷だが、社会主義は我々全員が喜びと苦難を分かち合うことを期待している。"
 WRS_examine_the_stockpiles_desc: "西ロシア戦争終結後に戦線がアルハンゲリスクに撤退した時、戦線は重要な装備を急いでいくつもの広大な倉庫に保管した。将校たちは、使い道のないこれらの道具を維持することは、肥大化した戦線に過度の負担を強いることになるため、それらを開くことはなかった。しかし上層部は、これらの倉庫には装備品の他に缶詰などの配給品もあったのではないかと考えている。\n\n我々は政治将校を同伴させた兵士をこれらの倉庫に送り込み、前線のための物資を見つけさせる。彼らがこれらを見つけたら、それを我々の倉庫に運び込み、そこから兵士たちに平等に分配することができる。どこからともなくご馳走が出てくるような魔法のテーブルクロスではないが、どんな切れ端でも戦線の助けになるだろう。旧連合は、消滅した後でも、子供たちに食べ物を与える方法を見つけている。"
 WRS_new_supply_chains_desc: "配給物資の再計算や、長い間失われていたと思われる物資の発見により、戦線は少なくともあと数ヶ月は生き延びることができた。しかし、それだけでは限界がある。厳寒の荒れ地で調達した食料や農場では、多くの人々をいつまでも養えないという問題が残っている。だからこそ、一刻も早く供給網を見つけて確保しなければならない。戦線の存続はそれにかかっている。\n\n我々は戦線のために食料を交換するための暫定的な行動を開始する。将校や政治将校を隣国に派遣し、外交的な接触を確立して、アルハンゲリスクに少しでも食料が流入するようにするのだ。上層部の一部には、連邦の領土に対する不法な要求者と交渉しているのだから、この妥協は受け入れられない。しかし、生き延びるためには、そのようなイデオロギー的な問題は重要ではない。"
 WRS_contacts_in_vologda_desc: "イヴァノフ将軍の裏切りによりドイツ領に進出したことで設立されたヴォログダ州は、「自由州」であり、すべてのロシア人にとっての中立地帯である。ヴォログダやイヴァノフの名を聞くと、士気溢れる同志は嫌悪感を抱くだろう。しかし、このような苦境にあっても、西ロシアにおける社会主義の唯一の灯火が人類に光を放つために生き残るためには、裏切り者と協力することも厭わない。\n\nヴォログダとは経済的に緊密な関係を築き、工業製品を食料と交換し、外交官はヴォログダと戦線の協力関係を深めるよう働きかける。憎き国家弁務官区との国境は、食料の流通経路としても有効である。世が世なら、前線は裏切り者や敵に協力するようなことはしないだろうが、今はそのような心配は脇に置いておくべきだろう。我々の時代はいずれやってくるのだから。"
 WRS_contacts_in_komi_desc: "プレセツクの南、トゥハチェフスキーの領地を越えたところにコミ共和国がある。西ロシア戦争で前強く対立して分裂した後に独立し、複数政党制の議会制民主主義を確立した国である。特にその指導者をはじめとして、裏切り者ではあるが、コミの人民は敵ではない。多くの人が旧連邦の理想に共感しており、そのことが他の誰よりも我々を結びつけている。コミと戦線の間には協力関係が自然な状態である。\n\n我々は戦線の外交の手をコミに広げ、コミの議会の各政党との関係を築く。我々の緊密な関係を考えれば、それほど時間はかからないだろう。何しろ、コミの人民はかつて我々の仲間であり、今でも多くの人々が最終的な同盟を期待して我々を見ているのである。まだまだ先のことかもしれないが、今は何よりも食料が必要である。"
 WRS_the_eastern_pipeline_desc: "戦線の事実上の領土の東側には、連邦の土地の領有を主張するヴォルクタがある。大祖国戦争前に政治犯が送られた場所であり、ロシア人が「食料」について語るときに出てくる名前ではない。しかし、ヴォルクタの南には商人の国ズラトウーストがあり、欲しいものはいくらでも買うことができる。資本主義への協力は社会主義者にとっては忌避すべきことだが、この絶望的な時代にはそうしなければならない。\n\n我々は、ヴォルクタに政治将校や将校を送り込み、安全な通路を確保し、囚人の労働力でアルハンゲリスクまで食料を運ぶ。ズラトウーストに着いたら、できるだけ安い値段で交渉して、資本家の豚との長期的な取引を確保しよう。彼らは我々が欲しいものを持っており、彼らは我々が持っているものを欲しがっている。この協力は一時的なものであり、連邦がロシアに再び立ち上がるまでのものである。"
 WRS_distribution_networks_desc: "戦線が今あるロシア北部は広大な土地である。その重要性の低さと人口密集地がないことから、旧政権ではインフラの整備は優先されなかった。この時代に存在した鉄道や公共の道路は、ドイツ軍の爆撃でボロボロになってしまった。将校たちの間では、食料の入荷があると、それが腐敗して使えなくなるのではないかと心配する者が多い。\n\n食糧の供給は確保されている。今は何か他の事をしなくてはならない。食料の迅速な到着を確実にするために、我々は兵士を派遣して道路や鉄道を再建し、流通網を盗賊から守る。このようにして、社会主義の旗の下に戦う者が二度と飢えることのないようにする。社会主義者は自分で自分の面倒を見るものである。"
 WRS_food_security_desc: "西ロシア戦争以来初めて、戦線は領土内の兵士や労働者のために安定した食料を自前で調達した。明確な供給ライン、計算し直された配給の消費量、配給できるインフラにより、戦線は常に迫ってくる飢饉の脅威を回避した。兵士たちは、自分の分だけ働けば食事に困ることはないため、安心して夜を明かすことができる。\n\nこの成功を生かし、さらに士気を高めるために、貿易ルートが確立される前に設定されていたカロリー摂取量の規制を見直す。我々はこれを増やし、兵士たちに1日で数ヶ月、あるいは数年分の食事量を与える。社会主義の下での労働自体がそれなりの報いであるかもしれないが、前線の兵士が飢えたり満たされないことがないことを世界に知らしめることになる。"
 WRS_the_army_situation_desc: "西ロシア戦争が終結し、この西ロシアの片隅で孤立してから約10年が経過した。しかし、たとえ悲惨な状況であっても、悲観的になってはならない。そのためには、我々が持っているわずかな資源や力を最大限に活用するために、あらゆる努力をしなければならない。もちろん、ロシアで生き残り、活躍するためには、軍事力を持つことが重要である。誇り高き西ロシア革命戦線の軍隊を整備し、我々の土地を守るため、あるいはさらに拡大するために必要なことを遂行できるようにしなければならない。これは我々が取り組んでいる最も深刻な問題の1つであるため、その過程は厳格でなければならず、より多くの資源を割り当てなければならないが、我々の将軍たちはそれが十分に可能であると信じている。"
 WRS_further_anti_air_investments_desc: "先の戦争以来、我々はドイツの爆撃機の標的となり、彼らは我々を単にパイロットを訓練するための場所としか考えていかった。しかし、そう簡単にはいかないことを彼らに思い知らさねばならない。連邦時代からの設計と外国の援助者からの設計を組み合わせて、我々の限られた産業は対空兵器の生産を増やすことができる。それを使えば、毎日のように攻撃して民間人の生活を地獄に落としているドイツ空軍の航空機を狙い撃ちにして、苦しめることができるのである。おそらくドイツ人は、ロシアの辺境には単に何もないわけではないことを理解するだろう。"
 WRS_cycle_troop_levies_desc: "あいにく、我々が現在も確保している領地の一角に自身の領地を持っている、戦線の最高司令官であるゲオルギー・ジューコフとミハイル・トゥハチェフスキーの激しい対立により、赤軍の結束は揺らいでいた。しかし、戦線の実質的なリーダーであるエゴロフ元帥は、片方の側に多くの陸軍将校が採用されるのを防ぐために、巧妙な計画を立てていた。時々、将校にふさわしいと思われる者は、ウフタかプレセツクに送られ、どちらかの将軍の下で訓練を受けることになっている。同時に、以前に派遣された者を呼び戻し、今はWRRFの大義のために真の将校になるよう訓練しています。このようにして、我々は将校が陸軍を分裂させている対立のどちらかの側の手に落ちるのを防ぐことができる。したがって、これは日常的に行われていることであるため、2人の将軍にこのことを知らせる時が来たのだ。"
 WRS_foreign_manpad_training_desc: "1950年代、WRRFがロシアの自由のために戦っていた時、北極の向こう側にアメリカという同盟国があった。アメリカの諜報機関が、宿敵に対抗するための重要な装備を輸送してくれたのである。その一つが、一人の兵士が携帯して発射できる対空防衛システム「MANPADS」である。比較的新しい技術であったため、敵機の撃墜に驚くほどの効果を発揮したため、今度は赤軍の新兵にその使い方を訓練する。それが成功すれば、我々の対空防衛力はかつてないほど向上するだろう。"
 WRS_expand_bunker_complexes_desc: "西ロシア革命戦線は、既に辺境の地で少数のバンカー群や要塞を運用している。しかし、現状ではそれほど恐れるべきものではなく、敵の戦線への攻撃を思い留まらせることができないのは周知の事実である。これを解決する時期が来たのかもしれない。予算的にも比較的安価で、目的に適った効果を発揮してくれるそれらは、他の軍閥国家に対する防衛力を向上させるための良い解決策である。このような敵対的な環境では、適切で近代化されたものであることが非常に重要である。"
 WRS_test_their_mettle_desc: "軍隊を改良し、独自の演習を行っても、実際の実戦以上に軍隊をテストする方法はない。軍閥時代の混沌とした環境では、隣国への限定的な攻撃を行っても、多くの影響を受けることはない。そこで我々は、西方のキルピチニコフの裏切りの領地に攻撃を仕掛ける。我々の輝かしい社会主義に反対する彼らは、フィンランド人が自分たちを守り、すべてのカレリア・ロシア人をそこに移動させるための見せ掛けに過ぎない。もちろん、今のところは彼らとの全面戦争を行うことはできないが、これは我々の力を試すと同時に、フィンランドの操り人形を恐怖に陥れるための良い方法となるだろう。"
 WRS_learn_from_our_mistakes_desc: "オネガ近郊でのキルピチニコフ率いる「反共義勇防衛軍」との緊迫した衝突が終わった今、その結果を評価し、そこから何を学ぶべきかを考えなければならない。これはあくまでも、戦場での教訓を学び、新しい戦術や装備を試すための軍事演習である。したがって、戦闘を見ていた将軍たちや、戦闘に参加していた上層部の将校たちが、赤軍のやったことのうち、正しいこと、改善できること、あるいは全く変えなければならないことを解説しなければならない。大規模で効果的な軍隊を形成するプロセスは難しいが、これは良い最初の一歩である。"
 WRS_the_districts_situation_desc: "西ロシア戦争が終結したとき、上層部にとって、戦争中に裏切り者を出さなかった連邦軍の将軍の中で、ジューコフとトゥハチェフスキーが他の誰よりも優れていることは明らかであった。彼らはアルハンゲリスクへの退却時に戦線の柱となり、旧軍の大部分を救った。その後のドイツ軍の爆撃の中で、政治的な対立に疲れたエゴロフは、ジューコフをウフタに、トゥハチェフスキーをプレセツクに送り込んだ。\n\n今にして思えば、それは不完全な解決策であった。アルハンゲリスクの政治権力の中心からは離れていたが、二人とも自分の領地に定着し、エゴロフの教義とは異なる独立した軍隊を育てていた。戦線が一丸となって前進するためには、この二人を互いに和解させ、戦線と和解させる必要がある。社会主義はすべての労働者に、些細な違いによる分裂ではなく、団結を求めているからである。"
 WRS_investments_in_plesetsk_desc: "大元帥のトゥハチェフスキーは、プレセツクの領地を率いて、略奪者や反動主義者から戦線の国境を守っている。トゥハチェフスキーは戦線の理想に最も忠実な信奉者の一人であり、我々にもたらした全ての勝利に対する報酬を受ける時が来たのである。\n\n彼に報いるためにプレセツクに投資をしなければならず、すぐにアルハンゲリスクにでさえも見返りがあるだろう。新しい道路、鉄道、都市開発が行われ、小さな町がロシアで最も優れた武器を生産するのに適した大きな工場都市に成長する。"
 WRS_provide_additional_officers_desc: "トゥハチェフスキーによる我々への援助が役に立っている。戦線内での戦時共産主義の適用は、現在戦線の軍隊で使用されているライフルの数に現れている。近いうちに、信頼できる武器を持たない戦線の兵士はいなくなるだろう。この問題を解決する過程で、我々は別の問題に遭遇した。銃が豊富にあるにもかかわらず、兵士たちはそれを活用するための適切な訓練や上官の指導を受けていないのである。\n\nこの問題を解決するために、我々は再び同志トゥハチェフスキーに頼る必要がある。我々は彼に我々の将校を送って戦時共産主義の方法を訓練させ、トゥハチェフスキーの将校はアルハンゲリスクのホールに来て、我々の兵士を彼の基準に合わせて指導するのである。トゥハチェフスキー元帥の助けを得て、戦線は再び前進し、社会主義はすぐに世界に広がるだろう。"
 WRS_investments_in_ukhta_desc: "アルハンゲリスクの南東には、ジューコフ元帥が支配するウフタがある。ジューコフ元帥は、老齢と長い軍歴にもかかわらず、理想的なソビエト体制への信念を捨てておらず、旧ソビエト連邦に自分の思想的信念を見出している。彼にとって、戦争は終わりではない。兵士は革命を守るために組織された労働者だ。ウフタでは工場が稼働しているが、それは戦争のためではなく、そこに住む人々の生活必需品を提供するためだ。\n\nもし我々がジューコフのビジョンに投資することを選択したならば、我々の経済活動を計画・調整するために彼の役員や代表者を派遣してもらうことになる。時が来れば、この投資は銃だけではなく、労働者の満足や幸福という形で戦線に還元されるだろう。この措置を承認することは、アルハンゲリスクにおけるジューコフの影響力を認めることになるが、我々は戦時中に彼を疑わなかったし、今も彼を疑わない。"
 WRS_move_industry_eastward_desc: "軍隊を支える産業は、必要以上に無防備な状態が長年続いていた。多くの工場は国境に面しており、空と陸の両方からの空襲の標的になりやすい。第二次世界大戦中に行われたある提案にヒントを得て、ある兵站学者は、ドイツ軍の爆撃機の標的になりにくく、陸軍の攻撃を受けにくいウフタに重工業を集中的に移転することを提案した。\n\nこのような取り組みには、少なくとも1ヶ月はかかり、組織力も必要だが、いつものように赤軍はその任務を果たすことができる。工場とそこで働く人々が安全な場所に移されれば、我々はすぐに生産量の増加による利益を得ることができるだろう。"
 WRS_side_with_tukhachevsky_desc: "西ロシア戦争では完全な勝利は得られなかったが、ドイツ国防軍をほぼ壊滅させることができたのは、縦深戦術があった。多くの指揮官が既に慣れ親しんでいるドクトリンであり、我々が調整を加えてもすぐに習得することができるだろう。\n\n特に、歩兵戦闘車（APC）という比較的新しい概念は、我々の軍隊にとって非常に興味深いものである。自立した火力を持つAPCは、攻撃部隊の隙を突いて敵の後方に殺到し、戦線に大打撃を与える戦車の優れた相棒となるだろう。トゥハチェフスキー元帥が何十年も前に考案した戦略を完成させる技術がようやく現れたのだから、今さらそれを放棄するのは愚かなことだ。"
 WRS_side_with_altunin_desc: "トゥハチェフスキーのような優れた戦略家でもなく、ジューコフのようなカリスマ的なリーダーでもない、とアルトゥニンは批判されている。しかし、アルトゥニンがライバルと一線を画しているのは、仕事に対するたゆまぬ努力と、後方支援の組織化に長けていることである。\n\n西ロシア革命戦線の誕生には、誰よりもアルトゥニンが重要な役割を果たした。難民を戦闘機から守り、食糧の貯蔵庫が都市に到着し、ファシストの進撃を阻止するために各兵士に銃弾を持たせたのはアルトゥニンであった。\n\nこの不安定な時代に、西ロシア革命戦線が必要としているのは、信頼して国の運営を任せることができる男、アルトゥニンのような男だ。"
 WRS_side_with_zhukov_desc: "ジューコフは、ファシストに占領されたモスクワを襲撃し、敵地の中心部に何度も攻撃を仕掛けるなど、長年にわたってゲリラ戦の技術を磨いてきた。戦場での指揮経験も豊富で、その戦術的・戦略的な才覚で戦況を好転させることができる。さらにジューコフは、ウフタとその工業地帯の責任者を長期にわたって務めており、赤軍の戦力を維持し、ファシストの侵略者をこの地から追い出すための経済運営に必要なノウハウを持っている。\n\nファシストを出し抜くゲリラ戦術の知識と、産業運営の経験を持つジューコフは、来るべき戦争で西ロシア革命戦線の軍を指揮する理想的な候補者である。\n\n仕事を適切にこなしたいなら、ジューコフを呼べ。"
 WRS_forward_unto_dawn_desc: "久しぶりにロシアの空に夜明けが訪れ、空は静寂に包また。生き残ることを決意した人々の団結した意志を打ち破ることができるのではないかという無駄な期待を抱いて、旧連邦の粉々になった残骸の上空で空襲を行う飛行機は、数週間は来ない。ドイツは、ナチスの頭脳にしか理解できない目的のために、彼らを必要としている。彼らの意図が何であれ、彼らは恐ろしい間違いを犯している。前線は再び目覚めて震え、革命は再び進行する。\n\n戦線はアルハンゲリスク周辺の荒地での権威を確立し、再確認する。ドイツ軍の爆撃で砕け散った破片を拾い集めて、戦線はそれを再構築するのだ。ドイツ軍は我々に逃すことのできない機会を与えてくれた。社会主義が再びロシアを支配し、それが達成されたとき、我々は世界を赤い夜明けに染めるだろう。"
 WRS_the_failures_of_barbarossa_desc: "昔、ブハーリン書記長の政権の頃、アドルフ・ヒトラーと彼のファシストの豚野郎の取り巻きの力が、忌々しいバルバロッサ作戦の間、我々の国民を殺戮し、我々の土地を焼き続けたため、西側のドイツの戦争機械の力の下で、より大きく、より平等な状態の下で、ロシア国民の国家が崩壊した。書記長は、ナチスがドイツ国民を掌握したときに、連邦が装備や防御、準備を怠ることを許し、偉大な祖国のすべてがその後の虐殺でその結果を被ることになったのである。ソビエト連邦が誕生し、最も悲惨な世界大戦の後、我々は統一されたソビエト・ロシアの残骸であり、偉大なるアレクサンドル・エゴロフ元帥の下、ナチスのライフルの銃身に立ち向かう準備ができていたのである。"
 WRS_the_failures_of_suvurov_desc: "歴史の記録は、ロシアの全ての人々の苦しみを考慮に入れている。ツァーリ打倒のために死んだ人々や、ナチスの大群を撃退するために戦い、殺し、死んだ人々の血のインクで書かれている。しかし、バルバロッサは我々の流血の終わりではなかった。スヴォーロフの地では、我々の正当な土地を取り戻すために、我々の兵士が再び勇敢に戦い、エゴロフ元帥は我々の古い首都を奪還するところであった。しかし、すべての良いことには終わりがある。1950年代、アドルフ・ヒトラーがその大軍をウィンター・ラインに送り込んできたため、我々は再び成功の瀬戸際に立たされた。成功は手の届くところにあった、それでも我々は倒された。我々は崩壊した。我々は後退した。我々はロシアを失った。しかし、西ロシア革命戦線はその失敗を飲み込み、我々はより賢く、より経験を積んで進もうとしている。"

 WRS_uphold_the_system_desc: "ソビエト社会主義共和国連邦の黎明期、社会主義国家の偉大な創設者たちは、ロシア赤軍の力によって保証された非常権限を必要としていた。ロシアは、この「戦時共産主義」の権力下に置かれ、すべての産業は即座に国有化され、すべての食料源は飢饉を避けるために軍事国家によって管理され、すべての男女と子供たちは、軍事化されたソビエト国家のために生産する義務があるという厳しい規律の下に置かれたのである。この非常事態の中で、我々は団結し、世界中のライバルに立ち向かう準備ができた。我々は最終的には崩壊してしまったかもしれないが、崩壊したロシアの荒廃した土地で、我々の居場所を確保するために、体制は生きているのだ。赤軍の力を結集して戦線を支配し続けることで、我々が必要とするすべてのものの支配権を確保し、国民に献身的な社会主義の生活による偉大な生活を保証することができるのだ。"

 WRS_deep_battle_theory_desc: "シベリアの山、バルチック海。内戦期、数多の戦場で勝利を収めたのは赤軍だった。それでも、当時の赤軍は崩壊寸前だった。その赤軍に新たな理論を授け、再建した人物、それこそが亡きトリアンダフィーロフと、我らがトゥハチェフスキーの2人である。彼らが生み出した「縦深戦術」、それは全く新しい理論だった。その理論は一個人から連隊の動き、果ては大陸全体を舞台とする作戦に至るまで、戦場の全てを徹底的に管理することで初めて成立する。全ての部隊を管理し、完全かつ圧倒的な勝利をもたらすのだ。先の大戦における失敗も、完成された理論と組織を捨て去る理由には決してならない。その有効性は実践において既に証明された。最大の勝利を手にする道はそこにある。"
 WRS_shift_the_blame_desc: "我々は、西ロシア戦争が、ロシア国民が敗北の烙印として耐えなければならない最大の失望の一つであり続けているという事実を決して否定しない。しかし、ナチスが崩壊寸前だったときに、なぜこのような戦争に負けたのか、その真実を認めることもまた許されている。その真実とは、党監カガノーヴィチ察官であり、誤ったラーザリ・カガノーヴィチのもとで粛清を指揮したミハイル・スースロフの名である。野心的な裏切りという大罪を犯して権力を争う手段として対立を利用し、党のバランスを操作したスースロフは、ミハイル・トゥハチェフスキーの言葉によれば、我々に大崩壊をもたらしたのである。この大いなる裏切りを認識することは、問題を処理し、西ロシア革命戦線の前に監察官を裁くための大きな一歩となるであろう。"
 WRS_steady_as_she_goes_desc: "ゲオルギー・ジューコフ元帥は、ソビエト連邦の繁栄に貢献し、1950年代の西ロシア戦争の際には、数個の連隊を率いて卑劣なドイツの侵略者に勝利した。しかし、この人物は、強靭な国家の精神を身にまといながら、戦線の存続をかけて「自由」と「平等」の感覚を保証しようとする自由主義的な改革者たちと同志のような状態に陥っていることを認めるべきであろう。ソビエト連邦の真の後継者として、また新しいロシア国家の最大の可能性として、我々が西ロシアの強力な力を維持しようとするならば、ジューコフの持つ力を奪うように努力しなければならない。彼の名を汚すわけにはいかないが、政治的な面でもその名を広めるわけにはいかない。"
 WRS_ready_for_war_desc: "ロシアの地に迫る大きな闇。それは、極寒の破壊と騒乱の圧迫感と包囲の霧を広げる闇であり、ロシアのあらゆる統一感の息の根を止め、我々を滅ぼしながら世界帝国としての地位を確立しようとするものである。この闇は、ロシアの空に嵐を巻き起こし、地獄の火を降らせ、ロシア人の潜在的な団結と組織のすべての覚醒した感覚を焼き尽くす。この闇は、鉤十字と鷲をその旗印に掲げ、しかし、それが押し寄せるすべての土地にまき散らす混沌のように、内部的には混沌としており、国中の僭主が闇の握るすべての土地を自分たちのものにしようとする。この闇を洗い流す間近に迫った崩壊の中で、我々はこの圧制の嵐からの最後の脱出の準備をし、戦争の準備をし続けなければならない。いつの日か帝国は崩壊しロシアへの爆撃は止むだろう その日、ゲルマニアの総統は西ロシア革命戦線がいかに大きな戦争への準備態勢を整えているかをついに理解することになる。"
 WRS_ready_for_victory_desc: "ロシアの一部の人々は、主にドイツ人に対する復讐心を抱き、西側に肥大したナチス帝国に対して戦争の猟犬を放とうとしているが、私たちは、将来の成功を保証するためには、復讐の火以上のものが必要であることに気づいている。団結が必要であり、強さが必要であり、数が必要であり、協力が必要なのだ。我々は軍隊の力でほとんどを処理できるが、協力は全く新しい獣であり、いくつかの武将の退位が必要である、彼らが分断国家のために命を捧げようとしないように。我々は西ロシア革命戦線が 西ロシアを支配したあの西ロシア戦争の日々を思い出すだろう そして再び我々は より大きく より強力なロシア国家に団結する ロシア民族の完全な統一とナチスの脅威に対する反撃のために我々は準備をする"

 WRS_on_the_clock_desc: "我々の食糧備蓄は、かなり絶望的な状況にあることが、戦線の備蓄の調査・分析から明らかになってきた。この不足は解決できないものではないが、対処するためには困難な犠牲と不人気な選択が必要だ。しかし、このような窮乏が我々の方向に視線を向けるのは、今回が初めてではないだろう。戦線は耐える、戦線は生き残る。そして、戦線のために、一刻も早くこの選択をしなければならない。"
 WRS_necessary_sacrifices_desc: "WRRFの軍隊は、我々の安全と浮揚を維持するための主要な力だ。そのため、食料物資の配分を考える際には、優先されなければならない。我々の物流担当者は軍への食糧輸送を優先し、対空砲は我々の領土周辺の食糧備蓄の防衛を任務とする。国民全員への確実な食糧供給が実現するまでは、兵士が路上で餓死しないことが肝要だ。"
 WRS_pragmatic_diplomacy_desc: "かつて賢明なドイツ人が言ったように、『まず腹を満たすこと、それから倫理が生まれる』。現在我々が支配している土地では、ナチスとの闘争の燃料はおろか、全ての国民を養うための十分な食料すら生産することはできない。そのため、代替となる食料を探すことが急務である。破滅的なロシアの他の多くの軍閥や小国は、我々の思想的展望を支持しないかもしれないが、確実に食料と交換することを望むだろう。不定形な理想はひとまず置いておいて、民衆が生きていくのに十分な食料を確保できるようにしよう。"
 WRS_the_traitor_general_desc: "イヴァノフ将軍の裏切りによりドイツ領に進出したことで設立されたヴォログダ州は、「自由州」であり、すべてのロシア人にとっての中立地帯である。ヴォログダやイヴァノフの名を聞くと、士気溢れる同志は嫌悪感を抱くだろう。しかし、このような苦境にあっても、西ロシアにおける社会主義の唯一の灯火が人類に光を放つために生き残るためには、裏切り者と協力することも厭わない。\n\nヴォログダとは経済的に緊密な関係を築き、工業製品を食料と交換し、外交官はヴォログダと戦線の協力関係を深めるよう働きかける。憎き国家弁務官区との国境は、食料の流通経路としても有効である。世が世なら、前線は裏切り者や敵に協力するようなことはしないだろうが、今はそのような心配は脇に置いておくべきだろう。我々の時代はいずれやってくるのだから。"
 WRS_across_the_urals_desc: "ロシアの奥地に位置するズラトウーストは、大規模な武器取引で知られている。しかし、その不道徳な地獄は、食品生産、加工、包装など、他の多くの産業の本拠地でもある。我々の仲間内ではあまり喜ばれないかもしれないが、彼らは喜んで我々に食料を売ってくれることだろう。輸送は少し難しいかもしれないが、ズラトウーストの軍用犬は信頼できることで知られている。この供給源は、現在の食糧危機の解決策になりそうだ。"
 WRS_the_fractured_republic_desc: "プレセツクの南、トゥハチェフスキーの領地を過ぎるとコミ共和国がある。西ロシア戦争で戦線と険悪な仲になった後、独立し、複数政党による議会制民主主義を確立している。指導者をはじめ、裏切り者ばかりだが、コミの人々は敵ではない。多くの人が旧連邦の理想に共感しており、この事実が他の誰よりも我々を結びつけている。戦線との協力は当然のことである。\n\n我々は戦線の外交部門をコミに配備し、議会の各政党と信頼関係を構築する予定だ。我々の思想的な結びつきを考えれば、それほど時間はかからないと思われる。結局のところ、コミの人々はかつて我々の同志であり、多くの人々が最終的な同盟を望んで我々に期待しているのだ。そして今は何よりも食料が必要だ。"
 WRS_the_peoples_marshal_desc: "ゲオルギー・ジューコフはウフタの産業を統括しているが、それ以上の存在である。数十年に渡り、ジューコフ元帥はWRRFで最も尊敬される将校の一人となった。ソビエト連邦の為に戦ったその血なまぐさい誕生以来 バルバロッサの暗黒時代からスヴォーロフの絶望的な勝利まで、彼の技量は伝説のものとなっており、彼の改革的思考の噂はよく知られている。彼の周りには、反トゥハチェフスキーの軍国主義者から完全な社会民主主義者まで、さまざまなタイプの将校や役人がいる。ジューコフ元帥が今後の闘争で重要な役割を果たすことは明らかであり、彼の努力によってWRRFが勢力として根本的に再編成される可能性がある。"
 WRS_relocate_industry_eastwards_desc: "軍需産業の基幹となる産業は、長年にわたって必要以上に脆弱なままであった。多くの工場が国境に面しており、空襲や陸襲の標的になりやすいのだ。そこで、第二次世界大戦中のある曖昧な提案に触発されて、重化学工業をできるだけウフタに集中的に移転することを、物流担当者の一人が提案した。ウフタは、ドイツの爆撃機にとってはるかに魅力的な目標ではなく、陸上攻撃では事実上手が付けられない場所である。\n\nこのような努力は、少なくとも1ヶ月はかかるだろうし、組織的な技術も必要だが、いつものように赤軍はその任務を遂行してくれるだろう。工場とその労働者が安全な場所に移されれば、その結果はもたらされるであろう生産量の増加から、我々はすぐに利益を得始めることができるだろう。"
 WRS_meet_with_yakovlev_desc: "ウフタの有力者の一人であるアレクサンドル・ヤコブレフは、アルハンゲリスクでは改革派の思想を推進したことで悪名が高まっている。ヤコブレフは、特に戦時共産主義の現体制を批判している。このご時世、異論は許されないかもしれないが、彼の考えを聞き出す機会を設けるべきだろう。どうだろう。そのほうが、よっぽどメリットがあるだろう。"
 WRS_a_harsh_truth_desc: "アレクサンドル・ヤコブレフ氏との話し合いで、政府の中枢にいる多くの人々の考えが変化した。軍政共産主義の考え方は、スヴォーロフの時代や白軍が皇帝の名の下に蜂起した時代には有効だったが、我々はあまりにも少ない利益であまりにも多くを搾取していることに気づいた。戦線の長期的な存続は、われわれの支配地がわれわれの指の間をすり抜けて、われわれの支配が強まることによって保証されるものではない。我々のやり方を改めることは、確かに必要なのかもしれない。"
 WRS_doctrinal_reevaluation_desc: "西ロシア戦争では、ドイツ軍をロシアから完全に追い出すところまで行ったが、結局は失敗した。なぜなのだろう？確かに、第一の理由の一つは、戦線が何十年も利用してきた軍事ドクトリンの失敗である。トゥハチェフスキーの「縦深戦術理論」のようなドクトリンを再評価し、それが現代に本当に役に立つかどうかを判断しなければならない。将校の間では賛否両論あるかもしれないが、もし我々の生存が戦略を変えることを要求するならば、変えなければならないのである。"
 WRS_the_mistakes_of_the_past_desc: "ブハーリン主義によるソ連工業化の最初の波は、多くの利益をもたらした。しかし、それは、ドイツとの全面戦争に立ち向かうには、せいぜい不十分なものであることが証明された。おそらく、自給自足を追求することは、軍産計画の第一の目標であってはならない。何がうまくいき、何がうまくいかないのか、過去の産業政策を見直す必要があります。"
 WRS_learn_from_america_desc: "アメリカはかつて敵だったかもしれないが、西ロシア戦争では有用な同盟国であり、物資の供給者であることが証明された。CIAの銃はドイツ軍をA-Aラインから後退させるのに役立ったし、今でも活発な諜報網があるのは確かである。アメリカはソビエトやその理想と常に友好的であったわけではないが、将来的に彼らの援助から得るものがないわけではない。"
 WRS_into_the_future_desc: "自給自足政策はうまくいかなかった。軍政共産主義もうまくいかなかった。\n\nボリシェヴィキの第一世代が墓の中で転がるような、大胆で派手な発言だ。しかし、何十万人もの若者が無名の墓の上で、彼らの時代より前に命を絶たれたのに、それが本当に重要なことなのだろうか？ソビエト連邦が崩壊したのには多くの理由があるが、将来大元帥になるであろうジューコフは、その理由のひとつは、国家のあらゆる側面を支配するあまり、自分たちに不利益をもたらしたことだと考えている。我々は、我々の圧力を緩和することを惜しむことはできないが、真に人民のためのプロレタリア国家に向けた多くのステップのうちの最初のステップを、我々の報道機関の民間への委任から始めることになる。結局のところ、我々の領土には、単に彼らの声が聞かれることを望むメンバーのあらゆる事柄があり、我々が物事を適切に測定する限り、これらの一見単純な好意の身振りは、本当に、将来性のある連合への我々の計画の最初のステップに過ぎない。"
 WRS_why_we_fight_desc: "戦線の領土で暮らしている人々の士気は、やや低迷している。大元帥エゴロフの老齢は周知の事実であり、最近の食糧危機による困窮がその傷跡を残しているのは確かである。直ちに新たな宣伝活動を開始すべきだ、ロシア西部の解放と帝国の無秩序なネズミの巣に焦点を当てるべきだ、ヒトラーが死体になりドイツ人が内輪揉めしている今こそ戦線は最大の勝利を収める時だ！"
 WRS_why_we_survive_desc: "戦線の士気に最も大きな打撃を与えたのは、ドイツ空軍の絶え間ない爆撃であった。ドイツ国内の不穏な動きが噂され、彼らの「射撃訓練」はまだ終わっていないが、西ロシアでは爆弾や榴散弾の犠牲者を知らない人はまずいないだろう。すべての出撃を防ぐことはできないが、プロパガンダ機関を使って回復力のメッセージを広めることで、トラウマの一部を食い止めることができると期待されている。ロシア人は鋼鉄の魂を持っているのだ。冷静であり続けられるのは、我らだけだ。"
 WRS_a_united_front_desc: "戦線の指導者の継承は、これでほぼ確実となった。ジューコフ元帥の今後の指導の下で、我々はかつてないほど強力に立ち上がるだろう。ヴァルダイ丘陵とメドヴェジツァを越えて西ロシアからファシストの屑どもを追い払うだろう、そして我々は未来に向かって行進する大胆な新指導者の下で新たなソビエト連邦を建設するために全人類の幸福を胸に抱いて。"

 WRS_reestablished_farming_desc: "空爆の数年間、寒い北国でただでさえ珍しく複雑な問題である農業活動は、政府も労働者も、ドイツ機の明確な標的として命や道具を残すことを望まなかったため、難しくなっていったのである。ドイツ軍がロシアの空から消え去った今、最高司令部は、野外での農業が再び可能になったと判断した。もはや戦線は、その権力に対する非合法な対抗勢力に依存することなく、単独でロシアにおける社会主義の道標として立つことができるだろう。\n\n長い間荒れ果てていた畑には、再びロシアの豊かな果実が実ることだろう。戦線の兵士が、社会主義の名の下に、寒さの中で飢え、食料のない状態に陥ることは決してない。戦線はその名残を風前の灯として、やがて誰も飢えの感覚を知ることはない。我々は、明日の夜明けに向かって前進する。"
 WRS_uncover_the_industry_desc: "西ロシアでは、戦線が保有する多くの産業が、ドイツ軍の榴散弾によって、戦線が代替できない貴重な重機が破壊されるのを恐れて、隠匿せざるを得なくなったのだ。爆撃が終わり、猛攻が一段落すると、戦線は隠れていたこれらの工場を掘り起こし、そこで作業を再開することができるようになり、火が轟き、労働は鉄の川のように流れ出すのだ。\n\n戦線はこれらの工場のカモフラージュを取り払い、労働者は再びその床に群がるようになります。戦線の兵士と市民は、もはや消費財や工業製品の不足に悩まされることはないだろう。やがて、かつてマルクスがその著作で予言したように、誰も欠乏の意味そのものを認識しなくなるだろう。各人の能力に応じて、各人の必要に応じて。"
 WRS_resume_military_exercises_desc: "ドイツ軍の空爆が続く間、上層部は現在行われている軍事演習の中止を決定した。訓練された兵士は、ドイツ軍の爆撃機の猛攻を前にすると、明らかにカモにされてしまうからだ。そうしている間にも、訓練は密かに、地味に、夜の霧と暗闇の中に沈むように続けられた。その間、新兵もベテランも神経質になって不活発になり、規律の状態は悪化した。\n\n忍耐の時間は終わったのだ。演習は継続され、戦線の兵士は戦争の要求に対して自らを鍛え上げることになる。軍隊は以前より多く道路を巡回することになる。南の軍閥が空爆の事実に目覚めれば、遅かれ早かれ戦線に戦火が及ぶだろう。社会主義が再び アルハンゲリスクの門をくぐり 世界を取り戻そうとするのだ"
 WRS_dig_up_the_caches_desc: "西ロシア戦争とそれに続く空爆の直後、戦線は余分な装備をカモフラージュした備蓄倉庫に隠すことにした。しかし、その大半はロシア北部の無名の場所に埋葬され、戦線が旧連邦の後継国家として正当な地位を取り戻す日を待っている。人手も銃も不足しているこのような時代には、どちらか一方だけでも不足している状況は避けなければならない。\n\n戦線は、埋設された装備のある場所に兵士を送り込む。掘り出し、アルハンゲルスクか最寄りの武器弾薬庫に戻す。一方、戦線は倉庫や備蓄倉庫の扉を開け、その中身を兵士たちに配るのだ。南方の非合法勢力は、もはや戦線を弱視ではなく、恐怖の目で見るようになるだろう。"
 WRS_reopen_the_mines_desc: "戦線の撤退が近づき、爆撃作戦が始まると、ロシア北部で操業していた鉄やアルミニウムを連邦の他の地域に注いでいた鉱山は、ドイツの榴散弾の震動による崩壊を恐れ、操業を停止した。戦線は、作戦中にそれを利用するために鉱夫や機材を送ることを警戒していた。しかし、ドイツ軍が去った今、戦線はこれらの資産を放置し、萎縮させる理由はないと判断した。\n\n最高司令部は鉱山労働者に鉱山再開の指令を出し、輸送システムがアルハンゲリスクとの間を往復して、必要な資源を工場に運ぶ。そこで、戦線の工場は、鉄とアルミニウムを叩いて、戦車、飛行機、砲を作る。これらは、旧連邦の統一のための闘い、そして、その後の世界革命のための戦争に役立つだろう。"
 WRS_archangelsk_calling_desc: "アルハンゲリスクに重大な知らせがもたらされた。戦線を支え続けた大元帥エゴロフが死去したのだ。死因の究明に追われる中、戦線の指揮系統に激震が走った。戦線は新たな激変に備えなければならない。この10年間、戦線の中心的存在であった人物が消え、指導者が交代するのだ。戦線の主導権を握る者は、今後の連邦の運命を左右することになる。\n\n戦線は大元帥の後任を早急に決めなければならない。候補者はトゥハチェフスキー元帥とジューコフ元帥で、それぞれ南部に領地を持っている。戦線が誰を指導者に選んでも、急がなければならない。世界は常に変化しており、チャンスは待ってくれないからだ。"

They believe that the large, state-owned collectives will be able to accelerate the means of production in ways simple market growth cannot and will allow us to rapidly rebuild the country. On the contrary, the more orthodox socialists in the government believe the means of production are not yet advanced enough to allow the abolition of private markets, and that allowing private businesses to operate is a more realistic choice for our level of development.

Modern weapons need many different materials in order to be created and function properly. Tank engines need special components that must be made of chromium to work properly. Aluminum is vital to constructing airplanes as it is the only material light enough to allow them to take flight.\n\nIt is fortunate that the territory we have reclaimed has large reserves of both of these materials. If we want to assemble an air force and an armored fleet large enough to win a war against the full might of fascists we must begin mining these deposits immediately.

While the more impatient members of the party wished for immediate collectivization of industry and agriculture, this was simply not viable in the prevailing circumstances. Marxist theory is clear, socialism arises out of the ashes of capitalism. It would be foolish to attempt to force it into existence, when the foundation simply was not present.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Grand Marshal that Bukharin, for all his flaws, was correct in this policy. Now that our situation has stabilized, we can begin to revive the NEP. To stand up to reactionaries the world over and develop a truly socialist society, we will first pass through a form of controlled market economy.

At the time Russia's rail system was woefully insufficient to facilitate the mass movement of people and supplies required by a modern industrial economy. The Fascist invasion interrupted the modernization of our transportation infrastructure, but Bukharin made some progress and now we must pick up where he left off.\n\nNew rail lines must be laid down and old ones repaired until we have connected every major town and industrial center to one another. We will lay down a new system of paved roads to allow movement across the nation by car and truck as well as by train.

Our workers need to be ready to work as part of a machine that will span thousands of miles and consist of hundreds of factories, foundries, and munitions plants, all running around the clock to fuel the armies of the Front.\n\nWe will train the workers of our nation how to work in this new war economy.

Without tungsten we cannot make the armor-piercing ammunition that will be essential to defeating the massed tank formations the Germans are so fond of.\n\nDuring the reign of the warlords, when the traitors forced us back to the far north, shortages of both these materials hampered our war production. Now we have reclaimed much of our nation, including several promising but unexploited resource deposits.

At the price of a greater production cost, our factories will churn out more vehicles than ever before.

Once the bullets begin flying, the die will have already been cast; however, until that moment, the laborers of the Front are working around the clock to build up our industry to compete with the Germans.\n\nGrand Marshal Tukhachevsky has ordered that industrial expansion be accelerated even further. Some of his advisors warn of the dangers of taking such large loans, yet others point out that the economy is growing rapidly on its own, and this is no time to try to enforce moderation.

America and the other free nations of the world have access to specialty equipment purpose-built to make modern weapons and vehicles.

What has remained unanswered however, is what an army ought to be?\n\nRising above the bickering of Bukharin and the military failures of the past, Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky has had ample time to answer this question. Synthesizing his wisdom over two decades of defeat, his ultimate answer is simple; the army of the future is international.\n\nThe Red Army will never be resigned to serve as a simple tool of politicians. Instead, it will be a political organ onto itself. Comprising workers and peasants from across the planet, it will know no border. Men and women will look to it as the vanguard of their salvation, and rely on it to forever defend their interests.\n\nAn essential organ of the socialist state, it will wage war on any reactionary who dare threaten it, slowly liberating the oppressed the world over.

While it may be tempting to use our limited resources to produce scores of light vehicles, it would also be foolish.\n\nUsing techniques from the newly integrated Gorky Tank Factory, mass production will begin on a main battle tank. Able to fill all armoured roles universally, it must be based upon captured German designs as well as those produced a decade ago. Such a vehicle will be vital in exploiting breakthroughs, causing chaos in enemy supply lines, providing operating space for soldiers, and stalling reinforcements at any single point.\n\nLet the enemy unleash their fury upon us.

The venerable doctrines of the Northern Fleet, and its accompanying usage of light vessels will be vital to a successful defense at sea.\n\nWith each piece of the old armed forces we reconstruct, we provide hope to the proletariat of the world.

Young pilots, savagely gunned down before they could even escape their runways.\n\nSince that fateful day, the bastards have maintained sole dominion of the skies. Every soul of the east, from the smallest tot to the most hardened veteran has grown accustomed to a life of duck and cover. It matters not how many jets are destroyed or helicopters downed, for two more will take their place and continue this reign of terror.\n\nAs we reunite our lands, the Grand Marshal has taken special care to correct this national indignity. While we can never hope to outproduce the Luftwaffe, we can outwit it. By requisitioning all aircraft we can get our hands upon, training amateur pilots, and iterating on captured jet designs, we will attack quantity with quality. Russian skies are big, blue, and impossible for our enemy to fully cover. Soon, our bombs will rain down on Berlin, to deliver justice for the fallen."

However, in our time of isolation on the polar shores of Arkhangelsk, much more has changed then we could have ever anticipated. Decades of warlordism has degenerated the average man to a life of drunken stupor and banditry. As the years drag on, it seems the people have become complacent in their suffering.\n\nIf we are to unite the Motherland and drive out the fascist invader, we must shatter these defeatist, selfish sentiments. As representatives of the cause, our soldiers are detestable. As functional combat units, our men are incompetent. Per the Grand Marshal's orders, massive training programs are to be set in motion. The politically aware will become commissars, and officers will work with veterans to instruct their comrades on small arms tactics.

While it is tempting and even accurate to call such men traitors, it is not productive. A man who is incompetent at or absent from his post is usually does so not out of malevolence, but a dangerous sense of hopelessness.\n\nHopelessness is a disease that has only worsened in these chaotic decades. In light of past experience, the Grand Marshal's Red Army will employ positive heroism as opposed to foolish and ineffective punishment. Printing presses are to be scavenged, traded for, or constructed across our lands. We will devise new pamphlets, posters, slogans and mottos. The average soldier's mind must be barraged with reminders of the vital importance of his duties. We will eradicate defeatism, and in its ashes create a competent, dedicated fighting force.\n\nIn addition, the role of our commissars will be reinforced.

In light of the importance of the coming struggle, Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky has decided to implement extensive consequences for abandonment of one's post. Penal Battalions, firing squads and jail cells will become standard practice in the new Union.\n\nSome may call our actions barbaric, however such measures are necessary to defeat a much greater evil. If the Soviet Union is to liberate the world, it must first stamp out defeatists and traitors within its own ranks.

Upon its red banner it carries the world. Behind it gathers a bloody band; Poles, French, Czechs, Ukranians. The global proletariat cries out under the fascist yoke!\n\nIt is our solemn duty once again to answer this call. Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky has equipped the nation to confront this oppressive evil. Our struggle lies not only in liberating Russia, but the working classes of the world. To the millions who now toil in wage slavery, and the millions more in chattel bondage we say this: We have heard your sobs, we have heard your shouts, prepare for our arrival!\n\nWe are the vanguard of the oppressed of the world, it is a burden we endure with pride.

Subsisting on the residue of its past glories, it groans under its own weight; helpless to stop prodding raids and skirmishes across its hinterlands.\n\nIndeed, while it is not wise to underestimate, the German is in many respects a paper tiger. There is no-one better to defeat him then the Soviet people, those who have grown most familiar with his wrath.\n\nNow that we have skimmed the rot from the top of our rank, we must harden those that remain. For a state that carries such a burden as our own, \"good soldiers\" will hardly suffice. The men and women of the Red Army must be superior in every way to their fascist counterparts. We will breed soldiers who stare into the chambers of tank barrels and run towards the points of bayonets. Such an army, one who fears improper conduct more than then their bloated husk of an enemy, will be impervious to defeat."

There are two competing schools of thought on how this could be achieved. Some of our officers advocate for an extreme training program that would produce the most elite fighting men on earth. They say that since we will never achieve numerical superiority to the Germans, we must train each of our soldiers to fight like ten. Another faction in the military command is calling for a different approach.

From this chaos a new statelet has emerged as a beacon of safety and stability. The Ural Guard have cultivated a culture of extreme training and discipline, and the results are clear. Using smaller forces, they have been able to defeat numerically superior and better equipped armies time and time again.\n\nWe must model our training program off of the guards. If their successes can be replicated on a large scale our army will be unstoppable. There are some members of the Ural Guard who are sympathetic to our cause, and it would not take much persuasion to get them to teach us their methods."

The soviet fighting man might not have all the fancy equipment of his American or German counterparts, but that does not matter when he can strike before they know he is there and vanish before they are able to respond.\n\nThere have been some downsides to the new program. Training now takes longer, and our divisions take more time to mobilize. But when each division is its own army and each man is his own squad, this is an acceptable sacrifice. The Red Army will become the most terrifying opponent in the world, and our enemies will learn to fear going into battle against our soldiers."

By running soldiers through repeated combat simulations and live fire drills we can teach them how to stay calm and focused in situations that would break an untested man. It is one thing for a man to practice at the firing range every day. It is another to do so in the freezing rain with a simulated enemy patrol on the hunt for him.\n\nA bonus of these constant drills is that we can see how our weapons do in harsh conditions. These insights will help design the next generation of Russian weaponry that will be instrumental to winning the war.

Every level of the military must adapt to our new standards.\n\nRegular inspections will make sure that the rank and file soldiers are toeing the line and maintaining their equipment well. The officers will be expected to both enforce discipline and set positive examples for their men.

 WRS_zkukov_regional_the_new_soviet_era_desc: "西ロシアは今、わが栄光ある赤軍の力によって統一され、幾多の軍閥を解体し、ソビエト人民の敵を粉砕している。これらの征服により、西ロシア革命戦線は多くの新しい領土を支配するようになり、旧連邦の遺産の後継者であると真に主張することができるようになった。このような威信と力の増大は、戦線の将来の政治的方向を決定し、ゲオルギー・ジューコフ大元帥の指導による偉大で新たなソビエトの時代を切り開く時期が来たことを意味する。彼の力強い指導力のもとに、ソビエト連邦は再び立ち上がるだろう。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_restore_vkpb_membership_desc: "It is the Bolshevik All-Union Communist Party which took power in the October Revolution of 1917 and which formed the Soviet Union. Any attempt to reconstitute the Soviet Union must by necessity incorporate the party of Lenin and Bukharin. That is why we must take the first steps towards refounding the party by bringing its old members into our administration, in a limited capacity. The front is still a military regime under Grand Marshal Zhukov, but we must look to a future beyond Soviet reunification."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_emphasize_the_partys_status_desc: "When Lenin was still alive, the Bolshevik party was an internal democracy, in which every party member had a say and disagreements were handled in a comradely manner. The dictatorial rule of a single man was unthinkable. As was the idea of allowing the party to be swayed by backward layers in the general population. We would do well to revive these principles within the Front and the future party, ensuring that the voices of party members are put first."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_emphasize_the_peoples_role_desc: "In this age of warlordism and fascist insanity, we must remember the gains of October: universal suffrage, abolition of the classes, and power to the worker. It was always the intention of Lenin that the party should be the voice and sword of the people, and that the party should rule and lead on their behalf. While the military necessities of the Front make any ideas of democracy difficult, we would do good to remember what it is exactly we have been fighting for all these long years: the Soviet people."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_restore_the_administrative_divisions_desc: "Before our defeat in the West Russian War, the Front controlled great swathes of the territory across Western Russia. Now, our glorious Red Army has reclaimed much of this territory for us. Yet as it stands, our presence in these regions consists of little more than a military occupation, leaving the people without local government. In order to assert our control of these areas and consolidate the Front, it would be advisable for us to restore the old administrative divisions of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, reassuring the people that we have returned for good."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_maintain_military_precedence_desc: "While we have made great strides in recent years in our campaign to reunite the Soviet Union, we are far from the final day of victory. To the east lie a great many regions that still need to be brought to heel, and to the west lies the Nazi menace, our greatest foe. If the Front is ready for the military challenges to come, we will have to maintain strict military discipline and order. The Front is and must stay a strictly military organization, at least until our enemies have been vanquished once and for all. Any ideas about restating civilian governance will have to wait."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_encourage_the_state_meritocracy_desc: "Sadly the old West Russian Revolutionary Front was plagued by corruption and cronyism. With Grand Marshal Zhukov in command, we can begin to turn that around. From now on all appointments for military officers will be based on meritocratic principles, with no discrimination on the basis of background or nationality. This policy will ensure that our Red Army and the state as a whole are directed by loyal and competent men, and give all of our soldiers a sense that they too can rise in the ranks if they show enough initiative and grit."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_uplift_socialist_values_desc: "Prior to the arrival of the Red Army, many of the territories we now control were in the hands of Tsarists, Nazi collaborators, and other reactionaries. They have sadly spread their poisonous backward ideas amongst portions of the civilian population. We will have to put considerable resources into agitational propaganda to sway the people in these regions over to our cause, and instill in them an understanding of loyalty to socialist values. We are confident that with time, the people will remember the lessons of October."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_the_new_soviet_woman_desc: "It is Lenin who once said the women's section of the workers' army was of particular importance to the victory of the social revolution. Yet for too long the Soviet woman has suffered under the weight of domestic slavery and sexist chauvinism. The relegation of women to domestic duties and their exclusion from political and military life has been falsely excused in the past by the necessities of the war footing of the Front, but now there is no further justification for such a situation. Women must be granted full legal, social, and political equality, including the right to join the Red Army and fight alongside their male comrades."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_stress_soviet_egalitarianism_desc: "Many claim that the Front has a long way to go on women's rights, but such people forget the inherently feminist nature of our socialist system and the great gains that October won for Soviet women. The Soviet Union was one of the first countries in the world to grant women equal status to men in all legal matters, divorce upon request, and full rights to vote and participate in politics. Women continue to be equal in Soviet society today. We should not forget this as we fight to liberate women across the Russian warlord states."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_appeal_to_the_populace_desc: "We need to show the civilians in our newly occupied territories that we are different from the callous warlords and fascist fanatics who once ruled over them. The Front fights for the Soviet people, and cares deeply for their security and welfare. For this reason we must introduce increased pensions, ensuring that the old and infirm are not only protected physically from foreign threats by the Red Army, but also protected socially from the deprivations that they previously faced. Such measures will go a long way to appealing to the populace of Western Russia."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_rebuild_the_bureaucracy_desc: "The recent expansion of the West Russian Revolutionary Front has put severe strain on the state bureaucracy, with hundreds of administrators being sent out to govern our new territories. At our capital in [WRS.Capital.GetName] the central government is experiencing a severe manpower shortage. The situation has reached a level where our efforts to cement our control over Western Russia have been seriously hampered as a result. We need to rebuild the state bureaucracy from the ground up."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_liberalize_appointment_criteria_desc: "There are a great many men in our newly conquered territories who are former bureaucrats once embedded in the various warlord states. Despite many being associated with quite unsavoury regimes, such men could be of great value to our cause by helping us refill our depleted state bureaucracy. All of them will obviously have to be screened, and some excluded from possible employment, but the bulk will be of use. Under our guidance, they will learn to serve a new master: The Soviet people."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_escalate_dewarlordization_trials_desc: "Any and all proposals to rehabilitate the former warlords and their functionaries are preposterous. The Front must be the hammer which smashes Russian warlordism. Our justice must be swift and efficient, and forever put an end to such men. The de-warlordization trials already underway must be intensified and expanded, with all the former warlords and their worst apparatchiks put on trial and executed. Only then will the Soviet people know that we are serious about stamping out warlordism and reuniting our shattered union."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_legislate_minority_autonomy_desc: "One of the immense strengths of the old Soviet system was its emphasis on federalism and national-self determination. It is time to show the ethnic and national minorities in our territory that we are not Great Russian chauvinists who seek to rob them of their rights and liberties. We will establish the Bashkir and Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, winning the loyalties of the Bashkir and Tatar peoples and making it clear to all ethnic and national minorities that we are on their side."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_new_age_of_culture_desc: "Culture is not a field that the West Russian Revolutionary Front has had the luxury of being able to consider, but now that we have secured control over Western Russia, it is an issue we will be forced to address as people have more and more time to spend on leisure activities. Yet the government is faced with more questions than answers: What should be the approach to freedom of the press? Should art be free from censorship or reflect the needs of the Soviet state? Is experimental art a waste of time?"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_encourage_cultural_experimentalism_desc: "The early Soviet Union was the site of an explosion of artistic creativity borne from the liberatory spirit of October. It is time for us to revive that spirit, and usher in a new period of cultural experimentalism. The works of Vertov, Tatlin, and Kandinsky must be remembered and cherished. Creativity in literature, art, music, film, and more should all be pursued with vigor. Freedom of art and press should be re-established, even dissident press under state supervision and censorship. Such measures will fill the people with the knowledge that our Soviet state is a pioneer not just in politics, but in all other matters as well."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_enforce_proletarian_standards_desc: "In this period it is essential that we maintain the discipline and confidence of the Front, and the best way to do that is to regulate culture accordingly. All art, literature, film, and music should be tendentious, patriotic, socialist-minded, and generally optimistic. It should portray our Red Army soldiers as heroic and prefigure the future to come when we fully reunite the union and expel the Nazis from our land. Importantly, the press must remain fully in the hands of the state, with dissident media banned. Our people must be reassured of the righteousness of our cause, not distracted by crass artists and defeatist journalists."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_sponsor_cultural_development_desc: "All the great institutions of Soviet culture and arts were lost along with Moscow and Leningrad during the Great Patriotic War. If we are to revitalise socialist culture inside the borders of the Front, we will have to reconstitute such institutions and restore them to their former glory. New theatres, art academies, film studios, and universities will need to be built, and considerable resources put aside to encourage artistic and cultural projects. Only through such efforts can we kickstart our cultural development."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_uplift_the_young_bureaucrats_desc: "As the Red Army swept through the rebellious warlords of West Russia, many new and promising bureaucrats joined our government. It has been suggested that for their invaluable service to the revolution in those turbulent times, many of these so-called \"Young Bureaucrats\" are deserving of a promotion. Despite warnings from some within the current bureaucracy that these newcomers may be ideological deviants without an utmost devotion to the revolution, we have decided to authorise these promotions."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_lessons_from_the_old_union_desc: "When the great Lenin united Russia under the red banner, he had extended a hand of friendship to other socialist organisations such as the Menshevik Internationalists and Left SRs, only for them to attempt subversion after subversion of the revolutionary cause. In this same way, while the new bureaucrats may seem at first glance promising, the possibility of an internal threat arising from their promotion is too great. Thus, we will maintain the current centralised bureaucracy, for the safety of us all."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_pluralize_the_system_desc: "The Front is, to put it bluntly, terribly inefficient. The ideals of socialism are of course worth upholding, but pursuing them dogmatically while the Union crumbles around us would be a foolish endeavor. A new constitution, to be implemented upon the Front's dissolution, shall be drafted. This constitution shall guarantee democracy, a more stable and gradual path towards communism and, although opposed by some of the older bureaucrats, a limited amount of privatisation."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_cement_the_transition_desc: "While the chaotic era following the collapse of the Union necessitates a degree of authoritarianism, continuing such governance once immediate threats to the people have subsided would be both foolish and pointless. When the provisionary governance of the Front is dissolved and the new Union established, it shall be governed by a constitution, to be drafted immediately, upholding both liberty and socialism. After all, did Lenin not say that democracy is indispensable to socialism?"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_maintain_the_regime_desc: "The Front is a provisional government, this we all know, but the ideals it upholds need no alterations lest revisionary forces subvert what we have fought so hard to achieve. It is clear that once the front is dissolved, the Union must be governed by a new constitution, to be drafted immediately. As such, the new Soviet Constitution shall in essence continue the governance of the Front long after its dissolution. There is no need to change a system that has been proven to work."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_the_new_economic_policy_desc: "The failures of war communism are manifest: while the army is enriched, our people starve in the streets. While the State is bloated with economic planners trying to put the fires out, the sheer attrition of the system starts new infernos all the time. While the country burns, in other words, only a few benefit - and it is power, not prosperity, that this system creates.\n\nWe will be hypocrites no longer. With a limited expansion to free-market operation in our domains, our markets will not suffer from chronic shortages, and our people will be freed from chronic want. It is the way forward for Russia, and so too will it be our policy too."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_educating_the_people_desc: "Public education drives everything - it hones the youth and prepares them for entry into the Proletarian workforce of tomorrow. It pushes men and women, the brightest of their generations, into education where they can impart their learning to those who can carry the torch. And in doing so, it improves the quality of our industry, research and all-round public life.\n\nWe must pivot to secondary and primary education, give our people knowledge of more than the rifle and the farming tool, and give our country a future worth fighting for."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_fund_the_sciences_desc: "The Sciences are the key not just to innovation in all fields of research - it is science that dictates how efficiently the tank or soldier moves and how much work can be done by a workers' brigade without stopping. It drives the tactics of our frontline troops, and it ignites our ties with the outside world as our research community links with the cream of the global intellectual crop.\n\nIf socialism is not driven by people of science, why bother calling it the Immortal Science at all? For this reason, and all the others listed above, we will invest heavily into research and development, and build a nation that looks ever into the future."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_generation_of_visionaries_desc: "We believe in the power of the masses, not the will of single men and women, to drive history onwards. Nevertheless, we would be foolish to deny that certain intelligent men and women are more capable of advancing the Revolution than others - and these people, these visionaries, deserve to be recognized, honed and pointed straight at the Front's enemies as our biggest intangible weapon.\n\nOf course, finding these talents will never be easy. We will have to overhaul our research talent recruitment system and our standardized testing entirely, and the ideological aspect gives our Recruitment Department headaches, but for the rebuilding of the Socialist Motherland? All sacrifices are worth our while."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_generation_of_workers_desc: "We must never neglect the source of our power - it would be even more foolish than a tank brigade ignoring the fuel on which it runs, for at least the fuel of tanks can be replaced. The trust of our workers, once gone, is almost impossible to replenish. Thankfully we are tracing the patterns of worker efficiency, and with innovations in organization and labor standards we are building an integrated industry-network that will truly stand with the best in Russia.\n\nWe are not ones to sit around being complacent, either: our old union structure, while moribund, can always be kicked into assistance in upgrading the skills of our factory workers..."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_the_end_of_war_communism_desc: "War communism was a tragic joke - it was a joke without a punchline, because its real butt was the collective welfare of the Russian people. We must now emphatically turn away from this mess of a policy, embracing the will of the free market to drive some of our production and demand - the workers' welfare must be enshrined, and with it the tenets of Bukharinism.\n\nWe will not pretend that this is not, in part, a political move designed to boost our legitimacy. Nor will we pretend that our leadership will take the credit. But this is socialism, after all, and if it works... nobody will think to complain in the history books."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_measured_transition_desc: "Just because we are emphatically rejecting something, of course, does not mean that we are to fly into the passionate embrace of a completely foreign economic system. Woe betide the foolish who believe otherwise! The Revolutionary Front will move slowly but surely into a new and tested system of production, one which we are certain will fill the ideological and economic needs of our people.\n\nOf course, this does give us significant control over the eventual shape of the Union, but that is all according to design, yes? Our Front is nothing without its leadership, and control is the better part of responsibility, after all."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_develop_rural_infrastructure_desc: "Our ruralities suffered grievous harm in the interwar years, as the ravages of the war broke the back of the countryside. We will take measures to overcome this error by integrating them into the glorious new system we have designed - one that runs goods from the heart of the city to the ends of our domain in days, if not hours.\n\nWith this integration will come political control, of course, and there will be opportunities to enforce previously lax adherence to socialist principles - but freedom is not truly free unless it is socialist, after all. In time, the rural world will come to understand this."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_expand_the_oil_industry_desc: "An army marches on its stomach. But it can march further and through much more if it has oil.\n\nOil is the lifeblood of our army, and is what will grant us victory. Our mechanized military demands it for Tanks, trucks, and aircraft. Our economy needs it for trains and trucks to bring supplies and materials to where they need to go, and to power the factories of Russia. And we must provide it with as much as we can get."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_the_wealth_of_the_motherland_desc: "Vast timberfields in every direction. Acres upon acres of farmland. Enormous wealth hidden just below the surface. The Rodina is vast, and so are her resources. And the people of the Union shall use as many of these gifts as they can to free themselves from the Nazi menace, and to return her land to the toilers that live off of it."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_arrange_agricultural_mechanization_desc: "In many places, Russian farms are still worked by mules and horses hooked up to wooden plows. What modern agricultural practices that existed either never were implemented or discontinued due to a lack of equipment. That simply won't do at all. We will not suffer another hungry winter! Our farmers will have tractors, modern plows, and fertilizers to work beside them. We will see full storehouses and silos as an obvious result."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_increase_agricultural_subsidies_desc: "One may attempt to seize the grain from the farmer when it is not enough, but who would that serve? Neither the city worker, nor the peasant shall suffer the misery of hunger in our Union. We will give the farmers the funding they need, and we only ask for one thing in return: more food. Do whatever you have to, but give us more bushels!"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_reinstate_the_prodrazvyorstka_desc: "Everything is backwards. Farmers hoard grain while the people in the city starve. Crop yields are not enough on their own. It is hard, but we must take action for the good of our citizenry.\n\nOur troops will seize the hoarded grain, and give the farmers a fixed payment in return. We will try to redistribute what we can in an equal manner, to ensure that everyone can get what they are entitled to in an equal share."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_begin_the_redistribution_desc: "We have not inherited an egalitarian paradise. We have instead conquered a land that has abandoned its pretenses of equal wealth and disdain for private property. We see again a system of unequals, where a few have hoarded wealth while the great masses struggle. We fix that now. Property redistribution will begin again. And this time, everyone will really end up with what they deserve."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_return_to_bukharin_desc: "Our hatred of Bukharin's military policies is well documented. One may never forget that. But his economic policies? Those are hard to criticize from our perspective. One might even call them admirable. And we will continue with them. The Union will continue along this path, adopting the plans he set out to fulfill, and fulfilling the wonders that he had envisioned."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_policy_of_foreign_investment_desc: "Before the Great Patriotic War the Soviet government was hostile to foreign investment, believing that it was a foot in the door for foreign capitalist powers hostile to the socialist aims of our country. Now perhaps it is time for a change in perspective. Due to our shared hostility with the Nazis, we are on relatively good terms with capitalist countries like the United States. It may be immensely beneficial for our industry to allow some limited level of foreign investment from such countries. They will of course have to be kept under a close eye, but this is a small price to pay for the economic benefits foreign investment will bring."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_prioritize_developmental_industry_desc: "If we are to turn our Soviet motherland into an industrial powerhouse, we must focus on a developmental approach, implementing the most technologically advanced and modern techniques and methods to build a strong and efficient economic system. It is not enough to just build huge industrial centres in our cities. We must think about ways to raise the economic level of the entire country, increasing the number of workers, the diversity of industry, and its commensurate efficiency. This will ensure our long-term economic prosperity."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_develop_the_industrial_core_desc: "Even after attempts to expand Soviet industry under Bukharin, our industrial strength remained pitiful. Worse yet, most of primary industrial centres have now been lost behind the Nazi iron curtain. If we are to make our Soviet motherland strong again we need to invest heavily in the development of our core industry, prioritizing the construction of basic industrial goods in our main urban industrial centres. Only after we have built a solid industrial base can we begin to think about employing more modern industrial techniques across the country. This effort is essential not only to the economic future of the country, but also to our future security needs."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_western_sibplan_desc: "All agree that the Bukharinite administration did do one thing right in the economic sphere: The Siberian Plan. The building up of industry far from the German border in Siberia in preparation for the Great Patriotic War failed to win us the war, but it did show the possibilities of massive government effort towards industrialization. It is a legacy that we should seek to emulate. We will copy the plan and implement a version of it here in West Russia, expanding our civilian manufacturing, infrastructure, and military industry. Hopefully it leaves us better prepared to face the Germans than its predecessor did."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_recenter_the_policy_desc: "We must not lose ourselves in nostalgia for Bukharin's Soviet Union. His market reforms were ultimately a failure that helped result in our woeful unpreparedness to face the Germans in Operation Barbarossa. Rather than return to the old schemas, we must pursue a new policy of development based on a unique understanding of our Soviet economy, centering the needs of the Soviet people and principles of socialist workplace democracy. As Lenin himself always intended, workers organizations such as cooperatives and the Soviet workers councils themselves must be at the heart of our economic policy."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_expand_the_production_bureau_desc: "Lenin once said that Communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the entire country. He was wrong. Communism is Soviet power plus motorization of the entire country. Our nation is vast, and as a result our transport needs are seemingly endless. We must once again connect up the country by investing heavily in motorization, expanding our vehicle factories and investing in the creation of new modern vehicle models on par with those seen in other countries. One day soon the whole country will hum to the sound of a car engine."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_soviet_oriented_development_desc: "We must never forget the basis and origin of our Soviet workers' state: The soviets, the workers' councils that brought down the Tsar and the Whites. As a result of the Russian Civil War, the Great Patriotic War, and then the long years of Warlordism, the Soviets have been either destroyed by the forces of reaction or turned into rump bodies with no real power. It is time for us to turn this situation around by encouraging the re-establishment and revival of Soviet's inside our territory. Their first task must be to implement poverty relief programs aimed at raising up the Soviet population from deprivation. Only with a full stomach and a roof over his head can a worker fully contribute to our great socialist society."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_the_proud_red_army_desc: "Many dismissed the Red Army as a failure. That it had dissolved after the German invasion. When we threw the Germans back from the A-A Line, the world was stunned, but dismissed us again afterwards. Now, we have restored the front and move to take Russia once again. If the world doubts us, they do so at their own peril, for we are men of iron, born to fight, survive, and never ever admit defeat!"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_high_moral_standards_desc: "Our forces are not a temporary militia gathered to ward off the bandits at harvest time. We aren't the bandits either, living by pillage and thievery. And we aren't some warlord's hired thugs and murderers. We are the Red Army, the ones to liberate the oppressed masses of the earth, and the only proper military Russia has around here. So you better act like it, soldier!"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_stain_on_the_uniform_desc: "Tukhachevsky and his clique have been constantly going behind Marshal Zhukov's back, and occasionally trying to stab him in it. This is unbecoming of a professional soldier in the Red Army, especially ones with such high ranks as him and his men hold. They are a disgrace and a stain upon the uniform, and one knows what must be done with stains. These traitors will be removed from service."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_industrial_lynchpins_desc: "There are certain areas in our lands that have high concentrations of population and natural resources. It is only natural that we should take advantage of these locations to build our industrial facilities. Much like we once built Magnitogorsk to be our Gary, Indiana, we will build up these towns to be our Detroits, our Manchesters, and our Pittsburghs."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_learn_from_the_unification_wars_desc: "The battle for the western front required great skill and adaptation from the Red Army. Our forces had to fight in both farmland and great cities. To ford raging rivers, and cross enormous hills. To march through open fields, and to fight in dense forests. We must impart the lessons, tactics, and best practices in these areas to the entire army, so we won't have to learn these skills all over again."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_quality_over_quantity_desc: "We are going to have the best army in the world. It will have the best equipment, the best arms, and the best vehicles. It is also going to be highly discriminatory about who is going to be a soldier in the Red Army. Having a large military is good, but there are many people in Russia who simply are not capable of making the cut. We want the best army, and that doesn't mean the largest one."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_efficient_supply_lines_desc: "Lack of supplies doomed our army back in the Great Patriotic War. It also doomed our forces in the West Russian War. It will not doom us again. For we will have an intricate group of supply depots and routes to ensure our forces, wherever they are, can get the ammunition and food they need to keep doing what they do best."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_strategic_theorem_doctrine_desc: "Grand Marshal Zhukov has had enough with the instability and lack of a chain of command that has plagued the front. It's time that the rules are laid down. There's one leader, and he's the man with the title of \"Grand Marshal\", understand? And everyone else does what he says. It's pretty sensible, and everyone should do that."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_marching_on_desc: "We have done it. After many years and hard fought battles, we have secured the west of Russia and the entire front against Germany. But Moscow isn't our next target, at least not yet. We will march east now to restore the former Union. Then the Red Army will double back to face the Germans once more."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_rolling_on_desc: "We need better armor. To fight off the various warlords of the east, and to compete with the Germans in the west. All our efforts must go into researching new designs. And if we can't build them ourselves, we'll go out and buy them instead."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_job_done_properly_desc: "Everything in the Red Army must be done quickly, and with the least amount of effort. There are a million things to do, and we must do them all fast with the resources we have. We expect all of our men to uphold this ideal."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_heroes_of_socialism_desc: "Many great deeds have been done by the forces of the Red Army for the people of Russia. We must remember these heroes, and what they have done. Their battles against the oppressors of Russia must always be remembered. And their stories shall motivate and inspire the army and the people."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_the_army_of_the_people_desc: "The Red Army is not a militarized arm of the VKP(b) as some will say. For when the system failed, who saved the people of Northwestern Russia from chaos and disaster? Who gave the Hitlerites a tremendous lashing during the West Russian War? And who delivered the people of West Russia from bandits and warlords? The Red Army fights for the people of Russia, and it will continue to do so until the red flag flies from Klaipėda to Cape Dezhnev!"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_looking_outwards_desc: "With West Russia under the Red Army's wardship once more, we have now reentered the world stage as an actor among equals. This comes with renewed attention from enemies and allies both old and new; consequentially, we invite unto ourselves great risks, great rewards, and great opportunities in equal measure.\n\nStavka will not dally in keeping away the first, inviting in the second, and seizing the third. We begin these three tasks by first answering an age-old dilemma: should the Front restore its old ties with the West's sleeping giant? Or should it forge its own path among our fellow socialists to the East?"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_eyes_to_the_west_desc: "アメリカは、大祖国戦争以来、赤軍の忠実な後援者であった。ライヒのファシストに対抗するためにチャンスを無駄にすることなく、食料、装備、医薬品などの物資援助は、赤城合意以降も西ロシア戦争まで継続された。外交官と共にワシントンを訪問することで、赤軍がスヴォーロフの失敗によって中断された関係を継続する準備ができており、その意志があることを彼らに示すことができる。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_send_yakovlev_desc: "ロシアが数十年ぶりに西半球に派遣する使節団にとって、第一印象を良くすることは戦線の必要性に迫られてのことだ。この点では、エゴロフの時代からアルハンゲリスクにアメリカを迎え入れることを熱烈に主張していたアレクサンドル・ヤコブレフとセルゲイ・アフロメーエフが、我々の一行を大いに助けてくれることだろう。同志ヤコブレフの修辞学は、アメリカ人の修辞学と驚くほど一致している。彼の言葉は、きっとアメリカ人の政治家やメディアにも響くだろう。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_meet_in_washington_desc: "外交儀礼、勲章をつけた制服、初歩の英語……同志ヤコブレフの側近に用意できるものは、もうすでに用意されているのだ。船はアルハンゲリスクからニューヨークへ、そして数週間後にはワシントンDCへ向かう。\n\nヤコブレフは、大元帥を安心させるために、コカコーラ社から威厳のある贈り物を持って帰ると言っていた。はい、同志ジューコフ、そしてアイゼンハワー氏が約束した釣りのタックルも。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_establish_a_consolate_desc: "By and large, Yakovlev's visit was a success. President [USA.GetPresidentLastName] and his associates heartily welcomed the Red Army's officers to speak before their Congress for the first time. The speech Yakovlev gave to America's assembled statesmen, his companions said, dominated the country's newspapers and televisions for days.\n\nit was in this revelrous fugue where the President invited our ambassador to the old Soviet Consulate, which [USA.GetSheHe] offered to us in perpetuity. Let's not look at gift horses in the mouth - or in this case, gift buildings in their facade."
 WRS_zkukov_regional_appeal_for_recognition_desc: "連邦がバルバロッサによって陥落したとき、その兵士たちは整然とした形で再編成された。ロシアが軍閥主義に陥ったとき、将軍たちは可能な限り秩序を保った。帝国がその傲慢さの結果、破滅した時、愛する赤軍が打撃を与え ゲルマニアは立ち直れなかった\n\n我々は祖国の強力な防波堤であり、西側の宿敵に対する1000年の監視を誓い合った者たちである。祖国のために、アメリカ人とその仲間たちは、この事実を思い起こさなければならない。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_western_investments_desc: "この地域の新たな平和は、戦後荒廃した土地を昔のように発展させる余裕を戦線に与えている。農民が休耕地を新たに刈り取り、労働者が荒廃した組立ラインに戻るように、資金もまた田園と都市の両方に戻る。\n\nアメリカ経済界の新しい友人たちは、スタフカがこの小川を流れに変え、やがて激流に変える手助けをすることに興味を持つかもしれない。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_tapping_the_market_desc: "西ロシアには、ルイコフのクロムやタングステン、ヴォログダやタタールスタンの鉄など、豊富な資源がある。他国が我々のような原料を欲しがっていることは、スタフカの間では問題ではなく、どの程度まで我々から供給してもらうかだけである。大元帥は、西ロシアの恵みを広く世界に提供すること、つまり、大切な収入源をもう一つ開くことを、全面的に禁止するよりも、むしろ奨励しているのだ。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_apply_for_ofn_aid_desc: "我々の行動によって、西ロシア革命戦線はアメリカに対してかつての地位を取り戻したのだ。西側の船はアルハンゲリスクに停泊し、大祖国戦争前と同じように、ロシアの鉱石を積んで去っていく。アメリカの将軍は我が軍隊を賞賛する目で見ている 外交官たちは、わが国の大使を赤軍のものと見なさず、ソビエト連邦が帰還したと見なすようになった。\n\n同志ヤコブレフの先見の明は、戦線に実を結んだ。今、我々は、これまで以上に、訪問のたびに兵士たちに希望を与えてきた強力な輸送隊を復活させることができるのだ。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_eyes_straight_ahead_desc: "アメリカと資本主義西側諸国は、戦線から何千キロも離れたところにあります。一方、レーニンとマルクスの後継者たちは、ブハーリンを除いて、ウラル山脈の東と南に、我々と同じ闘争を行い、我々と同じ大義のために戦っているのである。古い炎に絶え間なく恋い焦がれることによって、その先に待っている真の同盟者を無視するのは愚かなことである。\n\nすべてが終わったとき、世界は、赤軍が国際プロレタリアートのものであることを思い出すだろう。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_send_ryzkhov_desc: "大元帥一行の中で、ニコライ・ルイシコフは、旧ソ連国内および海外の社会主義者の仲間を支援することで、他の声をかき消した。労働者の団結した闘いの夢に対する彼の情熱は、ウラルの向こう側に、赤軍の戦争機械の障害物ではなく、同じソビエトの仲間を見る多くの人々に訴えかけていた。我らは、適切な言葉で彼の国際主義的傾向を共有する可能性のある国々への外交ツアーに彼を送り出すことで、良い結果を得ることができるだろう。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_against_the_german_giant_desc: "社会主義は、しばしば暴力的な手段によって、抑圧的な秩序から解放を勝ち取ることによって自らを定義している。この秩序は、カール・マルクスが『宣言』を書いてから100年の間に、資本主義、帝国主義、植民地主義など、多くの思想をその包括的なコーパスの中に織り込んでいった。今日、その最も新しく最も破壊的なものは、ドイツのファシズムである。この疫病は、大陸に根深い腐敗を残し、その影の闇で我々の国土を覆い尽くしてしまった。\n\n彼らは、少なくとも今のところ、何よりも我々の敵である。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_memories_of_fire_desc: "その昔、ソビエト赤軍は、ライヒの自慢の軍隊を打ち砕くほどの勢いで燃えていた。スヴォーロフがアルハンゲリスク-アストラハン線を襲ったとき、小銃手から大将まで、すべての兵士が古代の炎に取りつかれたようだった。その炎は勝利のたびに燃え上がり、やがてドイツ全土を焦土と化す真っ赤な地獄と化した。\n\nこの炎は、戦線の最も重要な瞬間に消し去られた。しかし、まもなく、この炎は再び燃え上がるだろう。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_a_nod_to_the_empire_desc: "彼らは不滅の資本主義者かもしれないが、米国はファシストの脅威に対して2度同盟を結んだ。しかし、同じ憎い敵を共有することで、2つの同盟国が結束することを妨げるものがあるだろうか。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_approach_socialist_governments_desc: "国際的な闘いは、私たちや他の人たちの直接的な行動なしには、実現しない。戦線は自分たちでそれを実現する立場にある、とルイシコフは言った。おそらく彼は正しいのだろう。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_international_socialist_solidarity_desc: "キューバからインドシナまで、ノルウェーのフィヨルドからマゼラン海峡まで、私たちは呼びかけ、世界はそれに応えた。政党も政府も革命家も、戦線の訴えを聞いてくれた。しかし、これは出発点である。"
 WRS_zkukov_regional_the_rykov_conference_desc: "今日、ルイコフの町は戦線がかき集めた最も上等な赤の服を着ている。窓辺には革命の旗が掲げられ、街角に立てられた旗竿の上には革命の旗が高くはためいている。赤軍は曲がりくねった通りをパレードし、バンドの武骨な太鼓に合わせて行進する。桟橋から降り立つ外国人の顔は、ロシアから流れ出た物語から、この街がどれほど進歩しているかに感心している。\n\n革命の次の段階である共産主義インターナショナルの本部としてここはふさわしい。"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_dissolve_the_front: "戦線の解散"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_dissolve_the_front_desc: "同志たちよ！今日こそ、そして今こそ、その時だ！ロシアの大部分が我々の下に帰還した今、「戦線」として国家の再生を続けることは不適切であろう。我々は社会主義共和国であり、ソビエト連邦とその遺産を受け継ぐ者である。革命の中核には軍隊があるが、労働者自身についても考慮しなければならない。ソビエト共和国は、国家を持つ軍隊よりも、（少なくとも公式には）我らの代表として優れているはずだ。当然ながら、我々は既存の組織を運営し、トゥハチェフスキー大元帥の権力を維持するものとする。赤軍をその凍てつく墓から引きずり出したのは彼であり、未来は彼のものである。\n\nトゥハチョフスキー元帥万歳！革命万歳！ソビエト連邦万歳！"

 WRS_tukha_superregional_enforce_discipline: "規律の徹底"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_enforce_discipline_desc: "新兵は戦争の背後にある意味をまだ理解していないことが報告されている。我々は物質的な富や栄光のために戦うのではない。革命のために戦うのだ。最下層の士官候補生から最高司令官まで、誰もが大義のために自己を犠牲にすることを期待されている。ウラル山脈の向こうの男たちは手に負えない酒を飲み、遅くまで議論している 見せしめが必要だ\n\n大元帥は赤軍の信条に背く者や指揮官に不満のある者に体罰を与えることを許可した 脱走や裏切りがあった場合、対象者はその場で抹殺される。大敗走を遂げた場合、限定的に大量殺戮の手段の使用が許可されている。"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_enforce_standardization: "標準化の推進"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_enforce_standardization_desc: "個々の兵士は頑健な精神と優れた肉体を備えているが、それだけでは十分ではない。しかし、それだけでは十分ではありません。我らが成功するには、兵士たちが協力することを学ばなければならないのだ。軍閥の時代は悪い教訓を与えてしまった－－一人で耐え抜くことは可能だということを。我々は連合国家であり、個人の栄光を求める余地はないのだ！次の戦争は大戦略で勝つものであり、組織は何よりも優先されなければならない。大元帥の教えに基づいた教義を全将校に教え、スタフカ自体も近代的な路線でバランスをとる必要がある。シベリアは何週間もあれば墜とすことができる。我々が征服するとき、ロシアの人々は、赤軍の華麗な姿を見ることになるだろう。"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_a_glorious_legacy: "栄光の遺産"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_a_glorious_legacy_desc: "かつて赤軍は、2つの大陸にまたがる帝国を、何百万人もの兵士を擁して打ち破り、そのすべてをソ連の優れた意志の力によって成し遂げ、不可能を可能にした。大元帥はこの過去を呼び起こす。過去30年間の敗北は記録から抹消されなければならない。赤軍は負けることなく、戦略的撤退を行うのである。赤旗を、闘争の準備をした何百万人もの兵士の頭上に掲げよう。彼らの大義は、何十年もの歴史、誇りの年月に裏打ちされた、正当なものである。ロシア全土が解放されて初めて、我々は祝うことを許される。その後、世界は真紅に染まり、我々はブランデンブルグ門をくぐることになるだろう"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_refound_the_vkpb: "VKP(b)の復権"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_refound_the_vkpb_desc: "革命戦線は消滅し、旧ソビエト社会主義共和国連邦に取って代わられた。我々は、この準軍事的な独裁体制を破棄し、ロシアの人々に真の社会主義を実現するための前衛となる党を出現させるべきである。さようなら、西ロシア革命戦線、そして、おかえりなさい、全連邦共産党！\n\n新生VKPは、中央委員会から運営される中央集権的な政治組織であり、社会の最も優れたメンバーと革命的英雄だけをその隊列に受け入れることになる。旧WRRFの軍人政治と本当に違うのかと思う人もいるかもしれないが、WRRFが革命的原則を念頭に置いて組織されていたなら、そうする必要があるのだろうか？もちろんそんなことはない。"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_assess_the_economic_structure: "経済構造を把握する"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_assess_the_economic_structure_desc: "ロシアはドイツに対抗する準備ができていなかった。西ロシア戦争にも対応できていなかった。ソ連が今、原始的な農場、未舗装道路、爆撃された工場で経済を構成する準備ができているとは、誰も思っていない。しかし、ロシアは準備しなければならない。そして、そのようにしなければならない。\n\n北部に豊かな成功をもたらした経済計画は、南部でも拡大され実施されるだろう。わが国の経済は、ドイツ軍との全面戦争に備えなければならない。誰もがこの目標を理解しなければならないし、誰もがそれに向かって努力する。"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_against_bourgeois_decadence: "ブルジョワの退廃に抗う"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_against_bourgeois_decadence_desc: "特に私たちのような社会主義社会に住んでいれば、日常生活に軽薄なものは必要ないだろう。これは本当に必要なのか？他のもので代用できないか？もっと少ないものでいいのか？そして、もし国が求めるのであれば、もっと謙虚に生きることができるだろうか？ロシア人は皆、あらゆる事柄について、このような問いを自分に投げかけなければならない。そして、取り戻した海外からの供給ルートが、そのモノのより有用なイテレーションをもたらすことができるかどうかを問わねばならない。\n\n毛皮は兵士に着せなければならない。絹のストッキングはパラシュートにならなければならない。鍋やフライパンは戦車や飛行機を作ることができます。紙は貝殻の容器になる。そしてゴムは、トラックのタイヤを作ることができる。全ては犠牲の上に成り立っているのだ。今、少しだけでも、耐え忍べばいい。ヒトラーの国家が滅びれば、後で世界の全ての快適さが保証されるのだ。"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_ensure_political_reliability: "政治的信頼性を確保する"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_ensure_political_reliability_desc: "ソ連は主に軍によって運営されている国家である。注目すべきは、誰もが赤軍で少なくともある程度の経験を積んでいることである。戦いに不慣れな人が革命をリードできるわけがないからだ。しかし、残念ながら、政府は将校の数をはるかに超える人数を必要としている。そして、誰もが戦場でソビエト国家への忠誠を証明できるわけでもない。\n\n公務員の候補者は、訓練を受けて忠実でなければならない。彼らは、『共産党宣言』、『なすべきこと』、『赤軍と民兵』を知っていなければならない。彼らは、あらゆる点で大義に忠実であることが証明され、非の打ちどころのない記録を持っていなければならない。そうして初めて、彼らは紙を取り、印を押し、束にするのに適した存在となるのだ。"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_the_plague_of_humanity: "人類の疫病"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_the_plague_of_humanity_desc: "大元帥トゥハチェフスキーはこの問題を以前、タンボフで見たことがある。反動的な農民の一団が、欺瞞的な教会によって嘘で頭を埋め尽くされ、ソビエト連邦に反抗したのだ。彼らは我が軍の兵士を磔にし、その家族を殺した。彼らを排除するために戦車や大砲、塩素ガスで応戦した。それは汚い仕事であり、数回以上の処刑を要したが、農村部は平和になった。今日、我らの土地では、反動分子と正教会が同じ病気にかかっている。そして、同じ治療法があるのだ。"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_our_partys_proud_banner: "わが党の誇り高き旗印"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_our_partys_proud_banner_desc: "単に賃金のために戦うだけでは不十分だとレーニンは言った。ロシアには、社会主義の価値と栄光を推進する組織が必要だった。強力な軍隊を持つだけでは十分ではないとトゥハチェフスキーは言う。その横に行進する強力で組織化された市民戦線が必要なのだ。その答えがVKPであった。共産党は、ロシアの人々に、世界をナチズムの魔の手から解放する必要性と、忘れ去られた社会主義の栄光を教育する。この恐るべき組織は、赤軍を補完し、1917年のように、赤軍の完全かつ圧倒的な勝利を確実にする。"

Across the firing range was the Grand Marshal himself. He had been invited down to Komi to watch the final trial of the newest rocket launcher system that would be used against the Reich in reclaiming West Russia.\n\nOnce the gunner had locked down his adjustments, he had pushed the fire button and stepped out the vehicle, prepared for the barrage to occur. While the rockets developed by Splav had a range of twelve miles, the technicians and designers intended to use them as a barrage that would soften up defenses before tanks could roll in. This was compared to the system of using the rocket system like a mortar, pinpointing each target carefully. The forty barrels on the main launcher had enough power to shoot two rockets per second if the launcher was using newer rockets and not older ones. As the driver and gunner watched from afar, Yuri began to write notes down, marking down the proximity to the target that had been marked out with a smoke grenade. While this would never happen in a live battlefield, it helped to train the gunners in marking down their precision for the barrage to land.\n\nAs the rockets landed within quick succession of each other, the Grand Marshal and his entourage around him clapped. They had invested quite the funding into the URAGAN Project, hoping it would bear fruit to help them in their inevitable crusade. Later that night on the train back to Arkhangelsk, he had prepared a letter to be sent to Tula to the director of the URAGAN Project, congratulating him on the success of the BM-21 and then telling him that the project had succeed and he hopes to see it in full production soon.

 indrik.32.d: "Valery grunted as he got up from underneath the BM-21 chassis, he was now dreading his choice of joining one of the many state owned repair garages. He had been given shifts constantly one after the other. However, he couldn't feel a bit patriotic in his duties. He was constantly repairing the BM-21, the next generation of rocket artillery for the Front.\n\nAs he got up from underneath, he dusted off his overalls and strolled to a fellow mechanic to discuss one of the many shortcomings of the BM-21.\n\n\"Hello Adrian\" said Valrey, hoping for a response from his comrade. \"Any new flaws you have discovered in the BM-21?\"\n\n\"Well, you know the normal. Rusted chassis, broken fuses, sloppy engineering when it comes to the rocket itself. The whole thing seems like it could explode at any moment if I am being honest with you my friend.\" Said Adrian, who was flipping through his notes.\n\nValery fumbled with his own notes before responding. \"Aye, I have nearly all the same problems, do you think the design will be approved?\" Asked Valery with a bit of uncertainty in his voice.\n\n\"Well it seems that these are only superficial to the Grand Marshal and his council, so I would hedge on the BM-21 going into full production\" Replied Adrian, who now was on the last few pages of his notes.\n\nVlarey thought about this before responding to his friend. Would the Grand Marshal really fast-track production on something that could be in its infancy?"
 indrik.32.a: "Later, he learned the answer would be yes."
 indrik.33.t: "Project URAGAN - INCONCLUSIVE"
 indrik.33.d: "The BM-21 began to grunt as it was attempting to go up the hill. Afar on an observation deck, the Grand Marshal frowned. Had he not invested enough money into making the next generation of rocket artillery for the Front? He was puzzled. From what he saw in his reports, progress seemed to be steady, with milestones being reached. As he saw however, some corners had to be cut to make it ready by the deadline.\n\nInside the testing facility in Komi, the staff was in a state of disarray. While they had some good trials and firing tests with the BM-21, it had a mountain of issues. The designers had meeting after meeting, to discuss these developments with most ending in arguments breaking out. It felt sometimes if the whole project would collapse in on itself, making the rift between designers even wider. However, usually at the end of the day, someone would suggest a quick fix, hoping it would hold. While these had been optimistic at first, they soon took a nosedive for the worse with even more arguments erupting over budget. Some days, after hours of work and discussion not even a single fix or change was made. As was life in the Project URAGAN development.\n\nAs time went on and on, more of the quick fixes had to be made. The chassis itself was eating quite a large bit of the budget, something that many of the rocket engineers had an issue with. Again, after the arguments and meetings that seemed to be a daily occurrence, they had finally reached an agreement. By the time they had agreed, their time had run out. Full trials had to begin the coming weeks. With the clock counting down day by day, they had to up their progress.\n\nTukhachevsky read this report on his desk and sighed. While the project could have been seen as a failure to some, they had increased in rocket development. However, the Front still needed something to move it."

 indrik.41.d: "Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky was in the observation bunker with his Politburo, while many of the other generals of the Front had seen Project TSYSKLON as a failure and a money sink, the recent tests had shown that this project was one that could help the Front extremely in preparation for their battle against the Germans.\n\nHowever, this project was not birthed by one man. It was the brainchild of an experimental division that had been assembled by many former Soviet scientists who had fled in the collapse of the Union nearly three decades ago. Many of which had been brought back into the fold after the Front had started their crusade to reform the Union and restore Russia to its glory days once again. After days and months of development and many restless nights, they had finally created something to be proud of.\n\nTukhachevsky himself had been invited to the briefing of the missile and the trials. He was shown a small presentation by the two head engineers and designers on the project. As Valentin Glushko walked up to the front, the Grand Marshal himself asked if the project could truly succeed. Glushko responded boldly to the leader of the Front, telling him that all would be explained in the live presentation. The Grand Marshal reserved his questions and sat quietly as Glushko explained the principles of a SRBM.\n\n\"So what exactly is the payload?\" Asked Tukhachevsky seemingly interested again, after hearing about the nine hundred and fifty kilogram warhead.\n\n\"Well Grand Marshal, it can hold conventional, chemical and even nuclear if we ever acquire the technology.\" Replied Glushko who was getting antsy due to the questions.\n\nTukhachevsky nodded and soon after followed the engineers to the bunker to watch the launch. What he saw amazed him."

 indrik.42.d: "The siren ran through western Komi on the testing zone that had been used for Project TSYSKLON and the development of SRBMs and different payloads. In the launch site, engineers sat slumped over in chairs. Hoping for a proficient launch and good results. As the camera zoomed in on the launch pad, the room was full of hopes when the ignition began.\n\nThese hopes had been squashed however once the ignition didn't stop. The control room then filled with grunts and moans of disappointment as they waited for the rocket to explode. A few minutes after it did. The launch leader put his hands in his head and marked off another box on his notes before asking his aide how many more of these tests they would need to do. As the site was cleared, another rocket was being wheeled to the launch site and the room waited.\n\nThis time however, the missile launched without exploding. The room was full of sighs of relief as the rocket lifted off and headed towards the target site, nearly three hundred miles away. As the camera lost sight of the rocket, the launch station radioed to the target station to make sure the rocket hit its target and not veer off course like some of the other rockets they had launched in the past. Soon after they had made contact with the target station, they had received word that the rocket was in site and was heading towards the target with extreme precision. The launch room filled with cheers as it seemed they would succeed. As the rocket hit the target, it seemed to detonate correctly. However, after the dust had cleared, it was apparent that the warhead hadn't detonated and only the fuselage did. The mood back in the launch room went back to disappointment as they awaited another rocket."
 indrik.42.a: "It seems this could be disastrous."
 indrik.43.t: "Project TSYSKLON - FAILURE"
 indrik.43.d: "The Project TSYSKLON team was sitting in their conference room, tensions had been high and they needed to hash out a solution. The deadline for the project had been moving closer and closer and the team had nothing to show besides prototypes and the carcasses of test rockets. While they still had the hundreds of blueprints and thousands of notes, they seemed to be an foreign language to the many designers. So many had been funneled in and out of the program due to working differences and personnel issues.\n\nWhile many of the lower ranked engineers had worked together, it seemed that fights and arguments had been constant with at least one senior engineer walking out on the meeting per day to only go back in later to regain their honor in a sort of shouting match. However, to many of the engineers on the lower rungs of the ladder and even some of the senior engineers, the most explosive was between Glushko and Chelomei. While the two men worked as allies, they had always had a bit of a rivalry with each other, and the stressful times had made the rivalry much more explosive combined with an ever creeping deadline.\n\nAs the meeting began, the first point of discussion was the topic of thrusters. After fifteen minutes of discussion, one of the senior engineers exploded into a tirade about budget costs and the ever expanding cost of fuel. The room soon went silent, Chelomei then muttered something about the fuel costing basically nothing compared to the cost of the warhead. Glushko turned to him and blinked, making sure he was hearing things correctly. He then responded telling Chelomei to shut up, however he knew this was a futile effort as Chelomei started to berate Glushko and the two started a shouting match. Outside the room, the junior engineers just looked at each other and shook their heads."

He cursed again about the cold, wishing he had been issued a thicker jacket, before scanning the horizon for their target. He moved around the tower of the submarine, making sure not to hit Maxim in the head with his arms. He thought he saw their target before realizing it was only a whale surfacing the ocean. Dima smiled for a split second before he kept looking. Once he spotted it, he called the captain on the radio he had.\n\n\"This is Petty Officer Ivanov, target sighted north, bearing 276 degrees\" He spoke into the microphone before clipping it back onto the radio and climbed down the ladder with Maxim handing him the radio. As he walked through the corridors, he wished that they had been designed to be a bit wider and taller, but it wasn't necessary.\n\nAs he walked through the winding corridors, weaving past the other crewmen. He walked past the mess hall and saw some of the men eat some of the lukewarm food that had been left over from lunch. Dima then walked into the bridge and placed his radio pack back onto the shelf before sitting down next to Maxim.\n\nAs the two sat there, they heard the torpedo tube be loaded and then the captain and the gunner's mate discussed the launch before the gunner's mate spoke into the intercom, authorizing the launch. The torpedo was then launched with the submarine shaking a bit as the captain looked through the conning tower. Dima noticed the captain's frown as he told the gunners mate the result of the torpedo. The gunner's mate shrugged and radioed headquarters.\n\nBack in Arkhangelsk, the mood was hopeful, but worried. Cost estimates had arrived for the submarines, they would cost a fortune for each submarine. After consideration, they finally sent a message to the Grand Marshal."

 indrik.52.t: "Project SHCHUKA - INCONCLUSIVE"
 indrik.52.d: "Lev stared at the cost estimates and shook his head. It was supposed to cost a few million less rubles, but after checking the math he noticed that they had gone over budget very heavily on the production of the new submarine that the Front had planned to use as an offensive and defensive tool when it came to the freezing oceans of Russia. However none of the designers anticipated it costing this much money.\n\nAfter meetings with the Politburo and even the Grand Marshal himself, they decided on only making a few submarines. But as construction went on with some light sea trials, more flaws exposed themselves. Due to the rush that they forced upon themselves, torpedos arming themselves and then falling out of their tubes was nearly commonplace on the submarines. Luckily in the light trials they did, no lives have been lost, however, privately some of the engineers thought this was a suicide mission. Why use submarines when you can just use ships? Some of the more experienced, older admirals thought this way, however their concerns had been drowned out by Tukhachevsky himself. He had seen the might of the German U-Boats during the Great Patriotic War and needed to learn. As much as he pushed for the development of submarines, the more he had pushback. However, they had quickly been silenced after the first, successful trials of the submarines. This didn't last for long, as costs and construction time began to pile up.\n\nAs Lev once again looked at his notes, he rubbed his temple. So far they only had the funds for only five submarines at most, but they haven't even built the frames for two of them. Only one was seaworthy and plagued by issues constantly. After he looked at his blueprints to see if anything was salvageable, he marked the torpedos and the engine. He would send his notes and messages to the Politburo and Grand Marshal tomorrow, hoping they would reconsider."

He knew that the long alarm knew something was wrong. That was the alarm that was let off, as he jumped out of bed, water was already beginning to lap at his ankles as he tried to get out.\n\nAs he looked out his room, he saw the crew rushing out of the submarine, many carrying personal belongings as they made a mad dash for the exit. He joined them in the dash as the senior officers and captain got everyone off the ship before themselves leaving. As they left the submarine they rushed across the gangway to the dock, as they watched the first and last submarine of its kind sink to the bottom of the sea.\n\n\"What do you mean it sunk?\" Asked Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky, sounding a bit annoyed but more confused than anything. \"Did something strike it, maybe an attack?\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem so Grand Marshal, we believe due to the rushed production of the submarine and the cutting of corners, that some of the safety procedures had to be removed per say.\" The officer said this to the Grand Marshal, hoping he wouldn't get too angry.\n\n\"Well was anything of value lost on the submarine when it sank?\" Asked Tukhachevsky, hoping that something was saved.\n\n\"Most of the plans had been lost on the submarine due to engineers making repairs on the craft before the incident had occurred that sunk the submarine\" said the officer, shrinking down more in his seat."

 indrik.61.d: "Mikhail looked up from his experiments for a second to look at the notes that had been taped to the wall, next to him was an open book from the United States that had been smuggled in about chemical weapons. The Front had come quite a long way from the former backyard labs that Mikhail was used to, now they had a pristine lab that smelt of formaldehyde. It was a far cry for many of the scientists who had been working in more dingy environments until the Front came.\n\nAs Mikhail flipped through the pages of the book, he recognized most of the chapters on the chemicals. He must've read the book from the cover to the index hundreds of times. The contents of the book mostly focused on the chemical weapons used by the world's superpowers in the past decade. Chemicals such as Agent Orange, and other, more secretive nerve agents. Most of the other scientists in the lab had similar books but on different topics, all of them needed to pool together knowledge if they wanted to succeed in this program.\n\nTo the many scientists and members of the upper echelons of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, they knew the chemical had been made, but not yet finalized. It was known internally as the Novichok Agent. While soman had been discovered by a German three decades ago and was seen as the most toxic nerve agent developed, Novichok had dwarfed it and was nearly ten times more potent than it. The weapon itself was prepared in anticipation for the Continuation of the Great Patriotic War and the reclamation of Moscow from the German dogs. Tests had shortly begun after Novichok was deemed as \"usable\" by the scientists who developed it. They started slowly by testing on the local wildlife, results had been impeccable with the success rate being over eighty percent.\n\nAs Mikhail made his final adjustments, he put his notes and other info into a folder and put a message on the front."

 indrik.62.d: "Pavel wiped the sweat off his face as he jotted down another batch of results from their chemical weapon tests. It was the third they've done today and around the twentieth they've done since the weapon could begin to be tested. Human test subjects had been out of the picture, due to manpower worries in the upcoming war against the Reich. So the Project LESHIY team had been subjected to the use of the wild animals that roamed the Komi Oblast.\n\nHe then signaled to another scientist coming in. He wanted to take a break. As he walked out the testing room, he walked past the storage facility. While the Komi Republic had quite the chemical weapon stockpile that seemed to be growing by each year, it stagnated soon after. Due to lack of knowledge and even funding, they had year and year after failed to come up with new chemical agents or formulas. However, this wasn't an issue for the Front. The Grand Marshal had directed lots of funding to the program itself and had placed many of the former scientists that had worked in Komi on the new program. Unlike the Komi program, this time they had adequate funding and something else Komi didn't have. A port that could bring in information from the outside world on nerve agents and other bioweapons. Pavel walked into the break room, hoping there were some tea packets or even instant coffee, a commodity that they only had one or twice every few months. He luckily found some of the instant coffee and went back to his station.\n\nAs the last test for the day was finished, he wrote his results on it. More of the same, the agent was less lethal than expected it seemed. While not being the kill agent they had hoped for, it still had damaging properties. Mostly the extended brain damage and organ damage. Pavel ripped the sheet off and then put in it an envelope, for the next scientist to take a look at. He then got up, clocked out and went home, as his day was done."

Did these fools not have any idea how chemical research works? He wanted to throw himself out the window if he had to read another one of these reports from a so-called \"expert\". Fools he thought. All fools. However, if there was one thing that Luka thought about, it was the colossal waste of resources and time of building weapons from scratch instead of using the already existing stockpile. While he himself had been a man who liked to make his own chemicals, on a scale like this it was suicide.\n\nConflict within the team had been a nightmare. Different scientists had joined for differing reasons, but all had wanted to accomplish the same goal. However, many had opposing ways of completing the goal. After time, these tensions that had been pent up exploded, with insults being tossed at each other during a meeting with members of the Grand Marshal's cabinet. As the cabinet members looked sheepishly at each other, they saw the arguments erupt along them as they sat, looking for a way to exit. Luka heard that when word of this reached the Grand Marshal, he shook his head and rubbed his temple in disappointment. Luka rubbed his face one more time at his desk and contemplated using the phone on his desk. While he had been high up on the ladder of scientists during this, he never expected to possibly call off the project.\n\nThe phone rang in Tukhachevsky's office. He had been looking out the window, with a drink in his hand, taking in the sights. He picked up the phone and after a few seconds, he subsequently pinched the bridge of his nose in annoyance. After a short conversation, he placed the phone back onto the rotary dial and poured himself another drink. He was going to need it after hearing about the failure of the chemical weapon program. He then picked the phone back up and phoned one of his aides."

As the assistant behind him plugged the air hose into his suit, he smiled at the assistant and gave him a thumbs up. The assistant replied and slapped Viktor on the back. The signal that he was all hooked up to the oxygen tank and was in a fully contained environment. The assistant then opened the airlock door to him, and closed it behind Viktor.\n\nHe waved to the man operating the room, the man waved back and pressed the buttons. The airlock was vented, Viktor felt a bit of pressure against him that soon had gone away. He waved one last time as he opened the vacuum sealed door and closed it behind him, activating the seal one more time. He knew the risks that had come with this line of work. If any of the possible biological weapons leaked, the guards on the station had the full authority to euthanize him and anyone else exposed to the subject. A leak would have nearly apocalyptic results on the Project. They had all sorts of viruses inside the lab, with most being acquired by less, legal means internationally wise. Many of the viruses they had inside the lab could take down many countries within months if they had released them right now. They had been constantly tinkering with them, altering their biological potency. However, what came with this was great risk of a leak or even an accident. The smallest drop of blood from monkeys brought from the Congo possibly infected with a vicious strain of smallpox could end the entire project. Luckily, the cabinet of the Grand Marshal had invested quite the amount of money into the project to make sure they had the best equipment.\n\nAs Viktor was going through his tests, he kept his eyes on one thing only, his hands. As he looked through the many vials and the corpse that was now chilling on ice, he always made sure no cuts had been managed to be made on his hands, potentially infecting him. However, today was like all of the other days, no cuts and now his shift was over. He walked up to the wall near the airlock and pressed the button. The man in the control room spoke through the speaker on the wall, welcoming him back into the real world, before opening the door."

 indrik.72.d: "Demyan sat around the large table with the other senior scientists, they had all known why they had been called to the room. Sitting outside however was Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky, who had been waiting for the meeting to begin. He was with his cabinet as well, hoping to see some activity come out of the room. As Tukhachevsky waited, he just hoped that they would take his arrival of news well. He was about to deliver the news that the project would only be able to make only a few biological weapons due to budget constraints.\n\nAs the door swung open, the men in the room had all jumped out of their seats and stood to attention to the leader of the Front. He saluted them and then told them to sit. Many of the scientists had been jittery in their seats, expecting to be told that the project was going to be canceled due to the budget constraints. However, the Grand Marshal then said the men would not be canceled actually. Instead, it would be lessened when it came to manpower and development. The budget of the project had begun to take its toll on them. While much of the money was still remaining, they had spent nearly sixty percent of it so far. All of the virus bases had to be sent to Russia, most often by smugglers or boxes that had been sent to Russia on the idea of \"scientific advancements\". While the boxes had been right about the advancements, it was a much more destructive type of science. As the Grand Marshal explained the reason behind the shortening of the program and the redistribution of men, Demyan listened more. He then was handed a list of the men who would be sent to different divisions to continue the war effort. As he read off the document one by one, Demyan waited for his name to be called. However, it was never called. He celebrated a bit to himself before calming back down and listening.\n\nLater, Demyan had been dropped off the official budget papers from one of his co-workers. As he flipped through the papers, he was relieved to see that they would be allowed to finish their smallpox project. Most of the other projects had to be cut it seems, as he flipped through the packet. Once he got to the end, he shrugged and tossed it aside."

He was in a spot of serenity for once, no news from the east of insurgencies or bombings, only reconstruction and peace. Then his assistant knocked on the door. Tukhachevsky was alarmed and opened the door, with the assistant nearly falling into him who delivered a short winded message. Tukhachevsky's eyes widened and he rushed for his phone.\n\n\"I need Yuri Ovchinnikov on the phone right now, it is urgent to the highest degree\" he said this into the phone with a bite that hadn't been heard since the West Russian War. As he waited for the phone, he opened his desk and flipped through the many lists he had of numbers and people to call if needed. He circled one with his pen. Grand Army Command.\n\n\"Yuri, are you alright? I had just received news of the anthrax leak? Is it contained yet?\" He said this to the scientist, expecting a rushed response. He gulped and hoped for a response, they would need to solve this fast.\n\n\"I am Grand Marshal, I had been rushed out of the research lab after the leak had been produced.

The boy had recently gotten over a nasty flu, and needed the extra vitamins.\n\nOn and on her calculations and allocations went. Eventually she had a good idea of how to stretch out the food for the week. Yuliya could not help but notice that the week's total was smaller than the previous week. A border conflict in the south had disrupted the transport network. This must have delayed food imports considerably. Added to that issue was the year's meager harvest. Farming this close to the Arctic Circle was not a simple proposition. As a result, the Front's government had to dip in its food reserve every year. The increasingly low level of stockpiles was an open secret. The region faced starvation within the next few years if nothing was done.\n\nThere was naught Yuliya could do about it.

But the accursed Luftwaffe had bombed important buildings just as the Red Army and the refugee columns entered the city. In the ensuing panic, the leadership had decided to move further north from the compromised city. By the time the dust had settled, Syktyvkar had slipped from the Front's control and into the hands of the young Komi republic.\n\nIt had been a decade since then, and the mess of records had only been partially resolved. The commissar doing the day's research work knew that the government had a good idea of the food stockpile level (\"not very high\") and of how long they would last (\"not very\"). But proper numbers were critical. Running out of food a month early could have catastrophic consequences. Letting crates of food go bad without using them would be equally intolerable. And so the WRRF's deadly calculations were carried on every day. Projected food reserves were stretched over projected calorie needs for factory workers, pregnant women, soldiers, children, and everyone else.

Only a small note in the margins of a shipping manifesto had revealed the hidden food supply.\n\nThe soldiers were hungry, as always.

Depicting itself as the continuation of the Soviet Government, the Front formally claims dominion over all of Russia, Vologda included. Yet in the aftermath of the disastrous West Russian War, the Front has had to recognize de facto our independence in Kostroma. While many in Arkhangelsk would see us bending the knee to the Front, for now the majority of the Front is content to do businesses with us on equal terms.\n\nOur main export to the Front is food, for the northern territories have little arable soil on which food can grow. While we are not an agricultural titan either, our food surpluses can always be traded with the Front in a profitable manner. The WRRF possesses a surprisingly advanced industrial base, and manufactures several superb equipments such as the gold standard AK pattern rifle in Western Russia. We can thus trade our food for good hardware."

While they have gone on about how it is our \"patriotic duty\" and whatnot, they have been willing to pay up when pressed, and so we have allocated them several shipments of rations and other assorted supplies for their journey back."

 WRS.8.d: "In the cold morning air of Arkhangelsk, two officers in brown observed as the soldiers of the Revolutionary Front train. They looked as the troops crawled in the mud, under fire from a machine gun firing blanks. Further afield, a line of sandbags lay between men and women kneeling, digging their rifles into their shoulders, aiming at the targets that stood in varying distances between them. A few NCOs stood there, checking the rate of firing with the ammo issued.\n\n\"And another good morning as well, lieutenant,\" the older officer said, adjusting his cap, \"I see that the troops are in order.\" The younger officer, hiding a smile, said, \"Thank you, sir.\" He looked to his superior to find a reflection of his pride. He found none. The old commissar held a stonelike frown. They stayed silent for a while. The lieutenant broke the ice, saying, \"What worries you, sir?\"The veteran touched his cap. He sighed and said, \"I worry for our numbers.\" The young man was about to defend himself before a wagging finger stopped him. \"Not your fault. When I fought in the war, losing a man or two was no problem. After all, there were a lot of good Russians,\" he swept his hands around the camp, \"as you see here.\" He looked down and continued, \"The truth is, we are losing men, you see. Your soldiers are good, but one or two will die. The recruits are not coming in fast enough.\" He returned his gaze to the troops. \"I worry about that; the casualties.\" He quieted down, muttering"

 WRS.9.d: "The telegram from Arkhangelsk was delivered to General Tukhachevsky. Marshal Yegorov's curt tone shone through the orders. The Front requested Tukhachevsky to send some of his experienced officers up north. In exchange, a fresh batch of recruits with college level education would be sent south to the military frontier for training.\n\nSitting at his desk, Tukhachevsky looked at the pile of paperwork prepared by his aides. The General found it slightly heart-breaking to write the relocation orders. Losing experienced staff was always disappointing. Even the prospect of seeing some of his loyalists in Arkhangelsk's court politics did not change the fact that good officers were hard to come by. Repelling bandit raids and preparing offensives against the reactionaries to the south. But this was Tukhachevsky's assignment, and staying in Arkhangelsk's good grace was crucial to his future.\n\nAnd so the general filled relocation order after relocation order. By the time his job was complete, his hand was cramped from signing so many orders. Upon being summoned, his assistant began transferring each order in an envelope. All this mail would be forwarded to the various sectors of the front."

A telegram had arrived. Everyone in the officer's hall gathered in its center, nervous to hear the news.\n\n\"Success on raid to the front onegans on the run - will pursue.\" The room broke into a cheer, even before the messenger had a chance to pronounce the last STOP. A few men jumped in the air. Some ran to catch cars heading to the radio station. Everyone was in high spirits. Bars started gathering crowds and crowds of people toasting to the names of the heroes of the battle.\n\nThis latest conflict has proved that the Revolutionary Front is on the up and up. It is a victory to the training, equipment, and doctrine of the Army. Though it may be but a footnote in the course of history, this is another triumph of socialism over despotism and fascism."

They come in stretchers, walking sticks, limping and bleeding. Shame flushed their faces in the morning cold. The citizens only looked at them and pointed their heads down when they found their eyes met. It was a defeat!\n\nAlready the officers in the high command shuffled their feet. They were set to conduct interviews with the soldiers about the combat they've just seen. But a question hung in the air. How did the Onegans beat them, while the Front held the superior equipment and doctrine, not to mention numbers and training? These would be a bitter lesson to learn. The fact that Onega won over them was insignificant in the long run, but the sheer humiliation endured.\n\nToday our comrades grieve. But defeat is not a stain that would remain long uncleaned. We will return, with the lessons we have learned today, and unleash upon the fascists and despotists our vengeance."

 WRS.17.d: "南にはプレセツクとウフタという軍管区がある。理論的には、西ロシア革命戦線の他の軍管区と同じように、有能な軍人が率いる地区である。実際には、南部の二つの軍管区は、WRRFの最も重要で物議を醸した二人の将校のための遠隔の亡命先と個人的な領地を兼ねた役割を担っている。\n\nゲオルギー・ジューコフとミハイル・トゥハチェフスキーは、共に勤勉で才能ある軍人である。労働者革命とソビエト人民への彼らの忠誠心は、ブルジョワと抑圧者に対する血生臭い内戦から、ドイツ軍に対する大祖国戦争の必死の戦いまで、多くの戦場で実証されてきた。しかし、50年代の暗黒の時代、それぞれの軍歴の頂点にある時、成功したドイツの反撃がソ連の戦線を突破し、WRRFの努力に悲劇が襲った。両将軍は長い間ライバル関係にあり、突破の余波で殺されたソ連兵の姿はこの争いを深い憎しみに変えていった。戦線の失敗を互いに非難したジューコフとトゥハチェフスキーは、その後10年間、WRRFの将来をめぐって、それぞれの支持者を引き連れて争った。戦線崩壊の危機を懸念した戦線の指導者は、アルハンゲリスクとその宮廷政治から距離を取らせ、それぞれの軍管区を統治することを適切と考えた。\n\nしかし、この距離は2人の偉大な将軍の間の溝を埋めるには十分ではなかった。WRRFの将来にとって重要な任務を与えられたにもかかわらず、二人は口論を続けている。アルハンゲリスクの将軍の支持者は、どちらか一方に多くの資源を流そうとし続けている。前線の人手不足にもかかわらず、トゥハチェフスキーとジューコフは大量のスパイを相手側に送り込んだ。その結果、アルハンゲリスクは捕らえられたスパイの収容所となることが多い。エゴロフ元帥の日常は、一方の将軍が他方の将軍の怠慢と無能を非難する手紙である。元帥の願いはただ一つ、両者が無駄な争いをやめて、目の前の仕事に集中することであった。"
 WRS.17.a: "なぜ彼らは自分の仕事をしないんだ？"
 WRS.18.t: "ドクトリンの再評価"
 WRS.18.d: "すべての軍隊は前の戦争に勝つために訓練しているという古い冗談は、エゴロフ元帥をあまり喜ばせていない。WRRFは前の戦争に負けたのであり、老将軍は過去の失敗から学ぶことだけを望んでいる。そのため、陸軍のドクトリンの近代化は、戦線の指導者にとって重要なテーマであり続けている。WRRFの欠点については、時代とともにいくつかの相反する理論が展開されてきた。\n\nジューコフ将軍とトゥハチェフスキー将軍は、改革の必要性に関してのみ同意している。ジューコフは、戦線の陣地崩壊から得た教訓として、工業力の低い国は、装甲や銃などの複雑な装備の備蓄を有効に活用しなければならない、と述べている。ドイツ軍が東部戦線を安定させるために最後の機甲師団まで投入したとき、WRRFはもはや機甲の損失と機甲の損失を交換することで先手を打つことができなかったのである。したがって、ジューコフは、ドイツ軍の戦線に注意深く嫌がらせを行い、孤立した機械化部隊を包囲破壊し、敵の装備と補給を全体的に低下させることによって、戦線は自らの立派な装甲のプールを決定的な戦いに利用できると推測しているのである。敵の局所的優位を破壊してこそ、赤軍は攻勢に出て地歩を固めることができるのである。\n\nこれに対してトゥハチェフスキーは、彼や他のソ連の理論家が20 年代に開発し始めた深層作戦の概念は、まださらに磨きをかけることができると考えている。20 年代から50年代にかけての赤軍の努力を破滅させたのは、前進する軍隊の連携の悪さと、不測の事態に対する防御計画の欠如であった。赤軍がこれ以上前進できないとわかると、再編成して敵の反撃を打ち返すことができず、前進のほとんどを消してしまったのだ。この問題は、すべての野戦軍を一つの指揮系統に統合することができれば解決する。\n\nアルトゥニン将軍もまた、赤軍の成功と失敗を振り返っている。彼自身の結論は、前線の補給線があまりにも弱く、前線部隊の戦闘能力をピークに保つことができなかったということだ。その最大の原因は、文官と軍部の一体化の欠如にあったと、元兵站将校は考えている。ソ連崩壊後、戦線は緊急軍事独裁体制となり、経済発展は放棄され、「軍事優先」政策がとられ、WRRFは「張り子の虎」となってしまった。食糧、衣料、装備を部隊に安定的に供給するために、経済のあらゆる分野を網羅したより現実的な開発計画と、再建された物流部門を組み合わせれば、再び攻勢をかける戦争にはちょうどいい材料になるかもしれない。\n\n3人とも強い分析力を持っており、各将軍の考えも大きな問題の一部である。しかし、限られた資源の中で、一つの方法を選択せざるを得ない。ましてや、この中の一人の案を支持することは政治的な影響もあり、他の二人がライバルの案を実現するために大きな手助けをしてくれるとは考えにくい。"
 WRS.18.a: "少し考えてみよう。"
 WRS.19.t: "エゴロフの命令"
 WRS.19.d: "結局、トゥハチェフスキーの提案に最もメリットがあった。トゥハチェフスキーは、その自尊心の強さからしばしば批判されていたが、改革案については、老元帥を感心させるほど内省的な考えを示していた。\n\nエゴロフが最初に着手するのは、おそらく指揮系統の改革であろう。野心的な将軍から兵を引き離すことは好ましくないが、各軍の統合は不可欠である。また、将校を再教育し、深い戦闘への理解を深めることも、WRRFが敵を迅速に蹂躙できる軍隊で統一戦争を始めるには、ますます重要になるだろう。\n\nプレセツクのニュースではトゥハチェフスキーが新兵に深層戦闘訓練を教え始めたと伝えている。ウフタでは、ジューコフが深層戦の優先順位付けを再開したことに落胆しているが、彼の工場は戦車や車両生産の再編成を行う初期の試みに協力してくれている。"
 WRS.19.a: "戦略は完璧だ"
 WRS.20.t: "アルトゥニンに味方する"
 WRS.20.d: "結局、アルトゥニン将軍の提案がエゴロフ元帥に採用された。ジューコフやトゥハチェフスキーの案も一理あるが、戦線の兵站を近代的に整備し直すというアルトゥニンの単純な考えこそ急務である。どんな高度な戦略的思考も、基本的な補給と物流の非効率性をカバーすることはできない。\n\nこのため、新たに文民軍事共同機構を設立し、物流計画の策定を支援する。この新しい部門は、さまざまな将軍からの供給要求を満たす代わりに、各軍集団から詳細な戦略計画を要求し、それに応じて資源を配分する。また、各戦略作戦地域には、万が一の事態に備え、余分な物資の安全マージンを蓄えることになる。\n\nプレセツクとウフタからの報せから、ジューコフとトゥハチェフスキーは自分たちの考えが無視されたことに落胆していることが伝わってきた。二人とも、兵站の充実の必要性には同意しているが、赤軍がロシアを奪還し、ドイツ軍に対抗するには、戦略・戦術の近代化が必要であることを主張している。しかし、エゴロフや戦線の上層部からアルトゥニンを推す声が聞かれなかったことに、二人とも落胆している。"

 WRS.21.t: "エゴロフの命令"
 WRS.21.d: "In the end it was General Zhukov's program that clinched it. Marshal Yegorov and his advisors recognized Zhukov's argumentation that the Red Army could no longer afford to fight as if its industrial capacity rivalled that of Germany. Two decades of conflict and bombing have considerably hindered the replenishment of the Front's tank fleet, among other things. In the fifties the Red Army managed to overrun the German's lax frontier troops and crush its out-numbered tank divisions. But when the tide had begun to turn and the fascists had started trading vehicle for vehicle, the Front's ability to continue mechanized warfare had withered away.\n\nZhukov's suggestion to withhold tanks from the frontline until a decisive victory can be earned has been decried as cowardice by Tukhachevsky among many others. But Zhukov has again and again calmly defended his ideas in a series of letter to Arkhangelsk. By letting the enemy exhaust himself in fruitless assault on line after line of minefields and defensive position, his local advantage in material can be rendered irrelevant. It ultimately littles how many armored fighting vehicles each side begins with; what matters the most, according to Zhukov, is which side is left holding the strategic breakthrough capacity once the dust settles."

 WRS.22.t: "The End of the Iron Storm"
 WRS.22.d: "The German planes had always saved a good quantity of their fuel and ordnance to bomb the Front's last few industrial center. Air shelter alerts had always been part of life for the WRRF's civilian population, long boring hours spent in bomb shelter punctuated now and then by a few instants of terrifying rumbling.\n\nThe last few months had seen rarer bombing. The Luftwaffe's habitual randomization of bombing runs had grown even more erratic, as what remained of available supplies was used up by the aerobases in Moskowien. As rumors had it, the winds of war were blowing closer to home. As the Führer's dying breath grew ever more strained.\n\nThe front's General Staff had long marked the start of every day by tallying the number of bombing sorties. Now the graph sloped down rapidly, as the number of grounded German planes soared ever higher. Rid of the fear of German vultures, the Front's supply convoys moved more confidently. So would the bandits, traitors and reactionaries beyond the Front's border, of course. But the general staff of the Red Army did not fear the Russian rabble. They had won the civil war, forty years ago. In the fifties the brave soldiers of the workers' state had almost brought down the German colossus. It mattered not how the WRRF's would array themselves, for the Front's generals would fight on, leading their men on the inevitable path of history. The day of liberation approached. Once the German planes flew their last, the wars of unification would begin!"
 WRS.22.a: "We will bury them."
 WRS.23.t: "Tukhachevsky's New Directive"
 WRS.23.d: "General Tukhachevsky had expected the telegram from Arkhangelsk. His own intelligence corps, limited as it was, had plotted the decreasing frequency of bombing runs. Traders that plied the routes between Western Russia and Moskowien had brought the rumors of the rising tensions in Germany. A German civil war seemed on the horizon. With it would come the end of the terror bombing.\n\nArkhangelsk expected much of him. The telegram from the Front's command informed him of the upcoming opportunity caused by a breakdown of the Reich. Resources would be free to move without the fear of aerial harassment. Offensive operations would be free to begin against the reactionaries and traitors of the Russian Anarchy. Tukhachevsky would be at the center of this; the other commanders expected him to step up his training program and convert a flood of raw resources and green recruits into hardened army corps.\n\nThe general thought of Zhukov receiving orders. He smiled. High command would no doubt see the assignments as a way for ambitious generals to prove themselves. Never a better time for general Tukhachevsky to secure his ascendance once and for all."
 WRS.23.a: "They'll have no cause for complaint from me."
 WRS.24.t: "Zhukov's New Directive"
 WRS.24.d: "Zhukov began his day reading the news from the north. Arkhangelsk's top brass had seen fit to confirm the general's suspicion about the decreasing rate of German bombing. With Germany itself spiralling closer and closer to civil unrest, the amount of resources allocated to the terror bombing was dwindling fast. Soon the Russian Anarchy might end.\n\nThis would make Zhukov's assignment much easier. The oil and agricultural sectors he had been tasked to develop would finally be free to use the full range of industrial techniques. Supply chains would be freed from the risk of being bombed during the day, making it easier to import the crucial ressources the Front needed. The Front's higher up expected Zhukov to increase the quota of goods brought to the Front for the war effort. The general had no intention of failing this task.\n\nThe general thought of his rival to the west. Tukhachevsky would no doubt see additional troop requests from Arkhangelsk. The upcoming wars of liberation would be an excellent opportunity to show loyalty and competence to the Red Army's leadership. Zhukov hoped the Front's would not be distracted by court politics at this crucial time."

There was much giggling and screeching.\n\n\"The Comrade Colonel will want today's report. Don't want him to wait any longer, now do we?\"\n\nAt his father's mention, Comrade Kirilov hopped out of his seat and flashed Nikolai a tiny, pencil-laden salute. \"Right away, Comrade Starshina!\"\n\nNikolai Petrov let both his own salute and smile drop as little Igor closed shut his office door."

With any luck his endeavors would be worth the migraine built from poor lighting and fine print.\n\nThen again, the map itself may already have been outdated by the time the courier delivered it to his office. Stable borders were luxuries in West Russia for a reason, after all. And what use was there in making deals with a dead warlord?\n\nGrechko loosened a groan as he inspected his map again. Scattered around its margins were one-page reports of the region's most notable warlords, like the tsarists in Vyatka, or the peculiar republicans in Syktyvkar. Some even discussed warlords beyond the Urals, like their compatriots in Sverdlovsk. These statelets could feed most of their charges with at least two meals a day: a damn sight better still than the Red Army's own capabilities in any case. Grand Marshal Yegorov would delight in knowing anyone the Front can trade with for food, reactionary or no.\n\nThe Front's Foreign Minister was not one for easy distractions - except, apparently, for the plateful of bread, butter, and thick slices of doktorskaya kolbasa his secretary returned with."

His fatigues were two sizes too small for his build; for that, Jonathan was grateful. It was pretty hard to intimidate someone when your camouflage trousers fit like pantyhose.\n\nHe humored the Ivan-bulldog hybrid by moseying up to three steps from him. The other recruits had begun to gather around, forming a ring with bodies for walls. \"Care to repeat that, Recruit Karabinov?\" he said.\n\nMuscles bulged as Karabinov seethed, baring his canines like the rabid mutt he half-was. \"I said-\" his fists curled and raised up, \"Fuck your mother Amerikansiy-!\"\n\nIn retrospect, the whole debacle unfolded in three short stages. First: the clumsy haymaker from the man-dog. Barely any weight from his shoulder and hips, likelier to break his own knuckles and wrist before someone else's jaw. Second: Jonathan's sidestep, followed by the grapple on the outstretched limb. Third and last: the leg sweep that brought both of them down to the snowy ground. A choke-hold and seven seconds later, and the brute fell silent. And unmoving, but Jonathan rolled him over like a log and cuffed his hands just to make sure. The MPs will see to him soon enough.\n\nBut for now, the stranded CIA agent dusted snow off his coat and stood up, facing fully his new class for the next three months. \"That's one way to start boot camp,\" he japed."

He caught them glancing silent questions at each other - like children awaiting a scolding. A wrinkled smile graced his lips despite his next words.\n\n\"Yegorov will kick the bucket soon.

While the Front was struggling its hardest and made great gains, Suslov had been plotting its demise since the beginning, anticipating for the perfect moment for his betrayal. And while the true men of the Red Army put everything they had into the Greatest Battle for Russia, Zhukov showed the greatest immaturity and made numerous anticipated strategic blunders.\n\n\"That wretched Suslov could perhaps be considered Russia's greatest traitor. During the greatest test of Russian courage, as the Front had to evacuate in the face of renewed Hunnic offensive, Suslov chose not to fight for the Motherland, he chose to betray us. Biding his time until we were vulnerable, he and his co-conspirators attempted to coup our rightful government. Luckily, his attempts were thwarted, but his scheme still cost us any chance of keeping the Front together and allowed it to dissolve into reactionary warlords.\n\n\"Zhukov's attitude towards the war was one of immaturity with a healthy amount of misconduct. His inability to put aside political differences and disappointing attitude in battle made him the laughingstock of officers and soldiers alike. What actually cost us the battle, however, was Zhukov's indifference towards strategy. His strategic incompetence meant that men were applied incorrectly, costing lives and entire battles. If only Zhukov had paid attention in officer school, perhaps I'd be writing victory memoirs in Moscow rather than ones of defeat in Arkhangelsk.\""

This time, Tukhachevsky hoped that at least he would be able to keep things from getting out of hand long enough to convince Yegorov that perhaps he wasn't such a bad man for a successor.\n\n\"You took your time, you're eight minutes late.\" Yegorov said driely. They were not off to a good start, and he knew that Yegorov would not make it easy to be friendly.\n\n\"My apologies Marshal,\" Tukhachevsky said biting his lip, \"what did you call me here to discuss?\" This nice act was getting very hard to keep up.\n\n\"I would like your input on strategic decisions for the Onegan campaign you suggested,\" Tukhachevsky felt set up, tactics and strategy always meant fights when it came to him and Yegorov, \"I think we should hit them with artillery for a short time, before doing several massed attacks on their border posts.\"\n\nTukhachevsky knew he was testing him, but could not hold himself back, \"Are you sure? That would give them time to prepare. I say we position our men in hidden positions nearby, doing a short mortar attack before ordering massed offensives.\" This had been a test, but Tukhachevsky would not back down.\n\nThe argument continued to go back and forth, back and forth, with voices being raised in pitch and volume every second. Yegorov accused Tukhachevsky of being out of order for his post, and Tukhachevsky said he wouldn't have to be this way if Yegorov wasn't such a bad strategist. Tukhachevsky stormed out seconds later.

Walking first through cold steel corridors, every step made the butterflies in his stomach flutter even more, and by the time he left the building his heart had sunk.\n\nLooking out across the wells, Zhukov felt the anxiety turn to rage as his face contorted into a scowl, and from a scowl into a shout. Out of the many dozens of wells, many were noticeably damaged, and of those some were completely destroyed. Knowing the importance of the quotas placed on his oil production and how tied to his reputation they were, he let it all out on the poor station manager before letting the entire maintenance and guard team have it as well. With spit flying from his mouth, all who were there stood silently as he roared.\n\nZhukov knew he had been bested, and he swore to god it was Tukhachevsky's doing, but he could not prove it.

Not expecting any calls, he picked it up and brought the se to his ear, and asked who it was on the other end, in a somewhat annoyed tone.\n\n\"This is Yegorov,\" Tukhachevsky froze, a direct line from the big man could not mean anything could, \"How could you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean how could I?\" a confused Tukhachevsky quickly responded.\n\n\"Smersh agents found your men hiding out in a ditch outside the wells,\" Yegorov's voice sounded like a mountain of steel.\n\n\"What about my men?\"\n\n\"Your men confessed. You destroyed the oil well. You destroyed Front resources over a stupid squabble like some reckless infant! You put your own men up against our own while Russia stands occupied from Belarus to Vladivostok! How could you?!\"\n\nTukhachevsky did not respond for several second. He opened his mouth to respond, but no words came out. After what felt like months of waiting, Tukhachevsky was able to utter a half sentence after many tries. \"I'm, s-sorry.\"\n\n\"You're sorry? You're sorry!?\" the phone screamed, sounding like a full speaker rather than a small headpiece, \"You aren't sorry! You've betrayed the Front for something as childish as a rivalry!\"\n\n\"I'm sure this can be expl-\" Tukhachevsky tried to defend himself, but the words weren't in him. He had been caught red-handed, there was nothing he could do. He had been caught, and with it, perhaps his chances of being the leader of the Front."

 WRS_power_struggle.15.t: "An Icy Grave"
 WRS_power_struggle.15.desc: "\"Over here! Over here!\" Nikolai screamed to his associate. Having been put on the case days ago, he and his work partner Denigin had been assigned to combing an entire forest some miles west of the wells. The truth was, it was snow, snow, and then more snow.\n\nThe temperature was bitingly cold, and that was not helped by the fact they had to scale the same mountainside everyday, walk past the same damn trees everyday, see the same damn animals, and get home with the same damn numb toes. However, Nikolai had just found something. Looking down in a small ravine to catch his breath after a relatively tough climbing episode, he had seen an object covered in snow and surrounded by ice. Denigin was beside him in seconds, panting to ask what he had found. Nikolai descended the cliff of the ravine, slipping on a rock that had actually been snow and falling back-first on the ground. Though hurt, he couldn't wait and forced himself to his knees, crawling to the strange object.\n\nHe wiped the snow off, and sure enough, it was a man. Denigin, having found a long way around bringing him down, arrived some minutes later as Nikolai closely examined the bodies he had found. Two, each wearing the insignia of Vlasov's ROA, were dead at the bottom of a mountain ravine that they figured they likely had tried to go into for warmth, before dying of exposure during the night. Each agent took a man's corpse over their shoulder and painfully, slowly, got back to their car.\n\nThe men working at the SMERSH headquarters did full background checks on the men. Working currently as low-ranking Tukhachevsky associates, both were found to have ROA connections and one was a rehabilitated member of the group. The case was closed. It was a ROA job."
 WRS_power_struggle.15.a: "What a grim way to go... At least we're not implicated."
 WRS_power_struggle.100.t: "A Shanty Crew"
 WRS_power_struggle.100.desc: "Zhukov was seated on a short wooden stool, a light creak yelped from the floor every time he shuffled around. He held a lukewarm glass of scotch in his shaky hand. Around him, the jeers and laughter of his crew, his men, his only friends as some would say. He took another sip to steady his nerves before observing the crowd.\n\nTo his left, Sergey Akhromeyev, a man of steel in his own right. Memories of conducting battle in the harshest of conditions with this man flashed before Zhukov's eyes. Suppressing revolts, the firing and cracking of rifles. Akhromeyev had been by his side through it all, and still more. On many battlefields he was the devil himself, the sheer whisper of his name sending bandits, Germans and raiders alike scurrying away without a single shot being fired. On others he was the slaughterer of hundreds, the harbinger of death and bloodshed from the end of a barrel. But tonight, he was a drunk man falling off his chair from laughing.\n\nIn front of line of sight was Nikolay Ryzhkov. Zhukov had always seen him as meek, well tempered and shy, not one for the battlefield. But it was in no doubt he knew how to carry himself through politics. Many a meeting and shouting match had been settled by the cool, level voice of Ryzhkov. So many decisions had been made with Ryzhkov's counsel, always informing Zhukov of the next avenue of opportunity. If there ever was a politician in Russia, Ryzhkov carried the full package. But tonight, he was hunched over on the table, passed out from one too many shots.\n\nAnd finally, to his right Alexander Yakovlev. This man was always a mystery, in truth. Zhukov was not sure how or why he had gotten to where he is now, but all he could discern was that he is a man of his word, one of honour, and that itself is respectable enough, especially in times like these. Always behind Zhukov's back, ready to take charge of a meeting or spearhead debate. He was likely the most intelligent of the bunch, but he didn't show it. But tonight, he was engaged in a fierce drunken debate with Akhromeyev regarding the attractiveness of old women. Yes, this was Zhukov's motley crew of men. Though many challenges are ahead of them, he will make sure they see themselves through, as they have many times before. God knows they must."
 WRS_power_struggle.100.a: "The boys know a good time, at least."
 WRS_power_struggle.101.t: "A Swell Meeting"
 WRS_power_struggle.101.desc: "Walking in through the doorway of Yegorov's office, Zhukov felt as nervous as he had the first time he had done it. This door always had a feeling of grandeur to it, like the conversation he is about to hold will decide the fate of many thousands of lives; and, more often than not, it did.\n\n\"Ah! Zhukov, I'm glad you made it, come in, come in, have a seat.\" Yegorov rasped out as soon as he stepped into the room. His health was not getting any better, and it showed by the day. His haggard old cough seemed to grow weaker every time he saw him. It was clear he was not long for this world, not anymore.\n\n\"Yes, well, I'm sure you know why I'm here by now, sir.\" Zhukov nonchalantly let out as he took a rest on the surprisingly cushioning yet firm chair. It was likely several decades old, but it showed no sign of wear. Expertly made, surely.\n\n\"Of course, you've brought the reports?\" Yegorov questioned. Zhukov was about to answer when a coughing spell suddenly struck, Yegorov put a shaky arm to his mouth and doubled over on the desk.\n\n\"Sir?\" Zhukov instinctively raised a hand to his commander, but Yegorov swatted it away and sat up fast.\n\n\"Mmergh, it's nothing. Carry on with your report.\" Zhukov had made this monthly report hundreds of times before, and reading the words he never once had to glance at the page. The content of the meeting mattered little anymore, simply the circumstances. As Zhukov said his goodbyes and stepped from the room, it was clear it had gone well. Yegorov was evidently pleased to see Zhukov, more so than he ever did old Tukhachevsky. Zhukov almost laughed as he strode down the hallway. How could he possibly lose out with favor so aligned for him?"
 WRS_power_struggle.101.a: "Too good to be true."
 WRS_power_struggle.102.t: "Suspicion in the Highest Places"
 WRS_power_struggle.102.desc: "By now, it was clear a power struggle had begun amongst the highest ranks of the entire West Russian Revolutionary Front. Espionage, distrust and contention ruled every day of every week of every month. Every peasant who existed under the red banner knew it would all come to a head eventually, but all they could now is keep their heads low and hope it does not boil over. But it takes more to win a struggle than just playing to favors and getting on the good side of people, far more, and Zhukov knew this better than anyone. It took some more... unscrupulous activities to bring defeat to your enemies, and that was simply what it took. As such, it should be that some light spying be conducted. Under the cover of night, an order went out. SMERSH agents unloaded into libraries, filing offices and history retention centers. All of them had one goal on their mind, and that was Tukhachevsky. More specifically, his past.\n\nIt is no secret the Red Napoleon is a man with a dark past at best, and many tell the tale of violence and suppression under his boot. But to truly upend his position, some real dirt must be found, not just the account of scared shitless potato farmers and circulating rumors as old as the air they travel on. And so it was that file cabinets were raided and torn asunder, libraries pillaged for information even loosely related to the man in question. For weeks on, agents would be hunched over their desks, studying and peering at incriminating document after incriminating document. Something would eventually come up, all it took was a little bit of time.\n\nAnd so it was that Zhukov waited patiently. He smiled knowing he would finally have something to wipe that stupid, smug grin off Tukhachevsky's face once and for all. He wouldn't know what hit him."
 WRS_power_struggle.102.a: "Well, something has to come up, first."
 WRS_power_struggle.103.t: "Conspiracy in the Records"
 WRS_power_struggle.103.desc: "Zhukov was beginning to get frustrated, waiting so patiently. It had been weeks since he sent out the order, yet nothing had yet returned. Not even a murmur about some big find, a smoking gun, nothing! But he knew it had to be there somewhere, somewhere among the thousands of paper trails, document boxes and file cabinets. It had to be. And so they pressed on. The SMERSH agents were really getting quite tired, but this was their job after all. Or, at least they were told. As long as they kept hunched over their desks, magnifying glass kept sturdy over the fading ink, they would find something. So the work went on and on.\n\nPaper trails which were first said to be promising were found to be nothing but dead ends, brick wall after brick wall. Agents were up so late into the night, doing work they shouldn't dare to be doing, not behind the Red Napoleon's back, that their wives began to worry. But it HAD to be there. Eventually, on one especially cramped, humid day at the office, a worker's hand excitedly shot up. He grasped in his perspiring fist a document, the end all be all, or so it was in his bloodshot eyes. The work foreman came over and snatched it away. The paper travelled up through the ranks, read by many eyes and promised to be greater than it had the last time. Eventually, Zhukov held it in his hands, peering at it closely, rereading some paragraphs a million times over.\n\nYes, something had been there."
 WRS_power_struggle.103.a: "They found something huge."
 WRS_power_struggle.103.b: "They found almost nothing at all."
 WRS_power_struggle.103.c: "They found something mediocre."
 WRS_power_struggle.104.t: "The Smoking Gun"
 WRS_power_struggle.104.desc: "It had been there. Oh lord, had it been there. The smoking gun. The incriminating document, the convicting letter, the end all be all that would finally drag Tukhachevsky's slimy hide to a firing line. Zhukov had not been this giddy since the West Russian War. Not only was there one convicting paper, but a dozen. The hard effort of the SMERSH agents had finally paid off, and paid so handsomely had it.\n\nYegorov by now was a weak man, his lungs failing him and his voice growing more weak by the day. But this morning, it was a thunderous boom that echoed across the office, the surrounding field and the whole of Archangelesk.\n\n\"Tukhachevsky! Where the fuck are you, you lying, backstabbing cheating bastard!\" It appeared that Yegorov had not quite liked the smoking gun as much as Zhukov had, but that was the best part of the whole ordeal. Documents which were buried under so many goddamn waste baskets worth of fodder were dug up and showed something that could make even Yegorov storm around.\n\nTukhachevsky had moved supplies, supplies that could've won battles, won them the entire war, from Yegorov's army to his own during the advance on Moscow. This action is something short of sheer treason in Yegorov's eyes, but only barely so! Tukhachevsky would inevitably receive a berating of a lifetime once he was eventually found cowering in some place in the city, and Zhukov can only sit by the sidelines and laugh! His gambit had paid off after all, and by God, was he now a rich man."

 WRS_power_struggle.105.t: "Nothing Concrete"
 WRS_power_struggle.105.desc: "It seems the \"smoking gun\" Zhukov had all so wished for did not exist after all. The documents brought up so high were really just various small, insignificant mishaps and actions which happened on a daily basis. The only incriminating reports found were those of the cruel day at Tambov, where Tukhachevsky slaughtered dozens, but this is already well known, a permanent stain on his otherwise proud reputation.\n\nAnd now, Zhukov slinks away into his study. The SMERSH agents pack up their operations, disappointed beyond measure that despite all their hard work nothing could be found. Yet, even more bad news arrives to deepen the blow. A little birdy told Tukhachevsky all about just what Zhukov had done, what he had the SMERSH agents do, and he is not happy. Not. One. Bit. Behind locked doors, he screams for Zhukov's head so he can punt it into the White Sea. The agents who conducted the digging found and thrown into the deepest cellars, miles beneath Arkhangelsk.\n\nOf course, old Tukhachevsky will have to wait on these wishes just for another while. Despite the fact Zhukov found nothing truly big, nobody is happy with Tukhachevsky by any means. It's always believed he has done quite a few shady things, and this only piles onto the rumors. After all, there is always the next opportunity to stab at the other."

 WRS_power_struggle.106.t: "A Flimsy Paper Trail"
 WRS_power_struggle.106.desc: "Nothing. Nothing was found. Nothing at all, literally zero incriminating evidence. All that was brought up was a few little anecdotes about abuses in Tukhachevsky's prison camps. Things already in the public eye are bigger than this. Zhukov locked himself away in his study for the day, smoking through his pipe. How could he be so stupid to not read more closely? He let such a perfect opportunity slip clean through his fingers, and just like that, Tukhachevsky keeps his stupid smug grin the whole way through.\n\nZhukov had decided this must be buried. Buried so far underground nobody will ever find it. Cover up his tracks, whiteout a few names, and nothing about a covert investigation into his rival will ever be found. He had to seriously rethink his strategies in the coming days, as it is sure Tukhachevsky has some devilish trick up his sleeve, just like Zhukov had planned to play on him. As Zhukov fumed in his study, Tukhachevsky attended a rich banquet with local oil barons. He smiled the whole way through."

Although quickly and defeated by the Red Army, the Mladorossi represent one of the most challenging cases as we continue our expansion.\n\nAn unholy hybrid of Soviet Socialism with Tsarist silliness, we would have already disposed of these fools if not for their potential use as loyal communist administrators by our state. This motley collection of émigrés, conscripts, and bizarre idealists is certainly many things, but their commitment to a socialist system cannot be doubted, even if only in bastard form.

He sometimes wondered whether or not it would've been better if he had died in the defense of his people.\n\nContinuing his despondent journey down the sidewalk, Nasr noticed a Red Army soldier putting up a Communist propaganda poster on the side of his favorite restaurant. Drawing closer, he noticed that the soldier bore a familiar face indeed. \"Mahmud? Is that you?\"\n\nNasr's call caused the soldier to turn to him, confirming his suspicions. \"Nasr! It's good to see you, friend! I was beginning to think you had died back in Arsk.\"\n\n\"It's good to see you too, Mahmud, but what are you doing in that uniform? You never struck me as a communist.\"\n\n\"Well, as it happens, our new overlords are in need of troops. After we surrendered, they offered most of us a place in the Red Army. I figured, why not?\"\n\nThis came as a surprise to Nasr. If the Red Army had no qualms about recruiting Tatars, perhaps the civilian governors were of a similar mind? Sharing farewells with his friend, Nasr went inside to grab a bite to eat. He remained suspicious of the Communists, but began to consider that, perhaps, it was not the worst possible outcome."

When the Grand Marshal's troops stormed the bunker, fighting the ROA room to room, they almost passed it over completely. Days after it was discovered, it was in Arkhangelsk, where the officers of the SMERSH poured over its contents with a fine toothed comb. The personnel files of the officialdom and bureaucracy of the ROA were a fine catch, if only to keep an eye on their former membership in future. It did not take them long to discover many of the documents contained details of a more sinister nature.\n\nAll of them were collaborators, the personnel in the files. That much was assumed by their membership to the ROA. Some were merely that - defectors from the Red Army who joined Vlasov at German prisoner of war camps, choosing treason rather than death by starvation in the camps. Their files contained little more than a list of battles they fought at during the war.\n\nThe others were different: Former SS members responsible for acts of unspeakable brutality against Belarusian civilians during Operation Cottbus. Officers who participated in massacres at the notorious Gully of Petrushino. Informants who handed over thousands to the gas chambers. One woman, Antonia Makarova, now living out her retirement in Samara after working for years as a secretary for the ROA, was responsible for the murder of some 1500 partisans and their family members during the war.

He looked around at his men, who surrounded the villagers with their rifles drawn. Steeling himself, he reached into his jacket and pulled out the order, placing it before him to read aloud.\n\n\"By decree of Comrade Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Grand Marshal of the Soviet Union, all persons of Finnish nationality residing within the territory of the Soviet Union are hereby exiled from the territory of the Soviet Union.\"\n\nA gasp went up in the crowd, though one could tell many had been expecting this. The Red Army soldiers shifted anxiously in place, their guns still trained on the enemy. He continued.\n\n\"All property, lands, and assets processed currently by persons of Finnish nationality residing within the territory of the Soviet Union is also hereby confiscated.\"\n\nSome of the Finns began to anger, hurling abuse at the officer. As they did so, he raised his voice, finishing off the rest of the order.\n\n\"All persons of Finnish nationality are to present themselves to Soviet authorities for immediate deportation and transportation to the Finnish border. All those who resist these decrees will be met with swift and immediate retribution by the people of the Soviet Union and their Red Army.\"\n\nNow the Finns were truly incensed. A woman in the crowd picked up a rock, hurling it at the young officers head. He ducked, the rock narrowly missing its target. Before anybody could utter a word, the soldiers were on her, beating her and others in the crowd mercilessly with the butts of their rifles. There was little resistance after that."

 tukha.79.t: "A New Refugee Crisis"
 tukha.79.d: "Aatto clasped his cigarette between his cupped hands and took a long drag as he watched the procession of refugees flow slowly past him. They went back as far as the eye could see, trailing off into the white, yawning expanse of Russia. He was grateful for the warm tingle of vodka in his belly and the small border guardhouse that blocked the worst of the biting wind. The marchers in the macabre parade before him were not so lucky.\n\nShuffling down the road, they looked a haggard, desperate lot. Some had been walking for weeks to reach the border, carrying everything they owned on their backs or in carts, on horses, anything they could find. More than a few of them carried the bodies of loved ones, victims of the Russian cold.\n\nAatto had seen this all before. He had been there in 1929, when the Soviets had deported thousands of Finns from Ingria and settled the east with Russians. Years later, the expelled Ingrians had been followed by the Red Army, streaming across the border to destroy his beloved Finland once and for all.\n\nThat time, the Finns had won. Yet as he looked out past the column of shivering outcasts, towards Russia, terrifying in its boundless immensity, Aatto felt a pang of dread. He feared that like before, the Red Army would march on Finland. And this time, they might finish the job."

 tukha.80.d: "過去、現代の数十年間は、絶望しかなかった。長い間、四面楚歌だったロシア国民は、漂流してしまったのだ。まるで、テーブルの端に置かれたドライデルのように、彼らは完全な忘却を弄してきた。しかし、そんな中でも、かすかな希望は残り、厚い暗雲の中に稀に光を投げかけていた。余分な配給、調達した車、異常に静かな空、人々はあまりにも長い間、小さな勝利に慰めを見いだしてきたのだ。\n\nしかし、今日、50年代以来、初めて雲が切れ光が差した。太陽の光が降り注ぎ、人々はその輝きを浴びる。大元帥は、長い間、上司、無能、日和見主義者の下で苦労してきましたが、自分自身が正当であることに気づいた。大義への献身と 革新的な理論によって 我々は頂点に君臨してきた、今日、我々は治癒への第一歩を踏み出した。西ロシアは一つであり、無敵であり、大胆に前進する準備ができている。大元帥の背中には強い風が吹いている。彼の伝説的な指揮の下、我々は決して挫けないだろう。"

 tukha.81.t: "The Redeemable"
 tukha.81.d: "The Grand Marshal listened to Beethoven's 3rd, one of his favourite symphonies, as he absentmindedly flitted through the letter from Svetlana Bukharina. There was a similar one from Yuri Andropov on his desk, but he wouldn't even bother glancing over that one. Andropov would follow where Bukharina went, and if Bukharina declared her undying faith in Tukhachevsky and the restored Soviet Union, he would follow suit.\n\nHe didn't much care what platitudes and promises of loyalty Bukharina had to offer either, truth be told. He could have had both of them executed for merely being members of Suslov's little clique in Komi, and they both knew it. Anything they said was simply an attempt to save their own skins, to avoid being shot and dumped in a ditch like Suslov, Gumilyov, Taboritsky, Voznesensky, Stalina, Morozov, and all the other traitors and reactionaries.\n\nHe had already made up his mind. Having the daughter of Bukharin in his camp would help bring the last remaining vestiges of the old Soviet regime onto his side, and win him the loyalty of the people of Komi, who adored Bukharina. Whatever problems she might cause in the future were a small price to pay for that.\n\nAs he tossed her letter to the side, he thought to the future. Finally the great wounds that tore apart the Soviet Union could heal, and united in spirit and purpose, the Soviet people could once again turn to face their true enemies. And he would be there, leading them to victory. First to Moscow, then Germania, and then beyond."

 tukha.82.d: "Old Man Vitaly had been around for a long, long time. He fought in the West Russian War, and before that the Great Patriotic War, and even before that, the Great Civil War for the heart and soul of Russia. He bore scars from a hundred battles and a small collection of medals proudly adorned his jacket, including that of a Hero of the Soviet Union, its golden star now rusted and chipped. Some said he was the oldest man in the Red Army, and the young bright faced men who fought under the banner of the Grand Marshal jokingly considered the old officer a good luck charm, though Vitaly protested the childish superstition.\n\nHe remembered life before the Revolution, when the Tsar and the Church ruled by terror in Russia. He remembered the pogroms of 1905, when the priests led the backward masses to kill thousands in the streets under the cry \"Kill the Jews!\" He remembered the servile superstition of the serfs, who were told by the priests to worship the Tsar as a living god even while their sons were sent to their deaths on the fields of Tannenberg. He remembered the years after October, when the priests had rallied behind the Whites and their foreign allies to surround and starve Russia.\n\nNow, after so many years, they had once more attempted to bring his country under the sway of their foul religion. The Order of Saint George, like all the old institutions of the church, would have to once more be expunged. The Grand Marshal had been correct to choose him for this task. The young officers did not remember. They would be too soft on the priests. He would carry out the new Red Terror with the zealotry of one who remembered the old Russia, who knew that there was no going back."

He was a proud soldier of the Front, a veteran of the Long War, he had seen hundreds of men die, felt the touch of starvation and frostbite, and had come out of it all with what he considered nerves of steel. The perfect soldier. The scene before him made him forget all of that for a moment.\n\nThe first thing he noticed as his unit strode into the surrendering outpost was the smell. He was familiar with the smell of death, but he hadn't ever smelled so much of it. A line of surrendered guards were pushed against the wall by a squad as the rest of the men fanned out into the outpost, although perhaps Slave Pen was a better term.\n\nThe people within barely resembled people at all. Thin, emaciated, they came meekly to Stepanov's squad, hands outstretched weakly, shaking, begging silently for food, for freedom, for sweet release. The cultists at Perm were maniacs, he knew that - but this was a new level of cruelty. He forced himself away from the liberated men and strode towards the line of guards, pulling his Tokarev from its holster.\n\nSome of the guards begged for mercy, saying they were forced to follow orders. Some held their heads high and declared to Stepanov he would meet the same fate some day. Some simply cried.\n\nWhatever the case, they were all shot."

 tukha.85.t: "One Man's Freedom Fighter..."
 tukha.85.d: "Grigory had felt uneasy throughout the entire campaign against the Bashkir partisans. For decades he had been the one hiding out in the woods, carrying out hit and run attacks, slipping behind enemy lines, fighting a guerilla war against the Wehrmacht that went on and on and on. In all that time he had never once considered what it felt like to be on the other side, in the position of the occupier, always fearing that the enemy was behind the next hill, or hiding in the foliage just out of sight. He had already lost half a dozen good men to random, sporadic attacks. A shot fired from the trees, a knife in the dark. These attacks filled him with a sense of dread that he had never felt in all his years struggling against the German war machine, rooted in a knowledge that the Bashkirs would fight as long and hard as it took to win their freedom.\n\nYet Grigory also understood what it was to be a partisan, and knew what it would take to lure them out. On his orders a local village was vacated, its residents, likely supporters of the partisans, deported East. His unit occupied the empty houses, and waited. It was only a few days before the partisans made their move, driven by hunger to seize the village's food reserves by force. That day the Red Army won a decisive victory, overwhelming the partisans and chasing them deep into the forest. Dozens were captured and killed, with very few casualties amongst Grigory's unit. His men were elated, and spent that night celebrating their victory with vodka. Grigory joined them, and for a while forgot the enemy that lurked in the forests of Bashkiria."

A call might come at any second, bearing terrific news that both of the factions would cease their bickering - if only for a minute. A generalship in the WRRF had been easier: no debates, no backtalk, and everyone followed his orders. He sighed.

 zhukov.7.d: "\"Dear comrades,\n\nSince the founding of the Republic a decade ago, it has enjoyed considerable autonomy from the central leadership of the wider West Russian Revolutionary Front. Made necessary by the chaotic condition of the motherland at the time, this arrangement has now become obsolete. The Front is united in the West and stands strong, poised to reestablish control over all territories of the Soviet Union.\n\nFor reunification to succeed, every part of the motherland must be mobilized towards that purpose. This includes the Komi territories. It is time for us to align ourselves more closely once again. We ask that you agree to this realignment. Should you accept, representatives from the Front will arrive within a few weeks time. Once in Komi, they will make preparations for the eventual reintegration of the territory. You can rest assured, however, that the laws, practices and traditions of your republic will be remembered, so its lessons can be applied to the betterment of the entire Union.\n\nOn behalf of the West Russian Revolutionary Front,\nGrand Marshal Georgy Zhukov\""
 zhukov.7.a: "了解。"
 zhukov.8.t: "Commissions for their Commanders?"
 zhukov.8.d: "\"Varennikov,\" the Marshal said, reading the names of the two files before him out loud, \"and Oplesnin.\" Tonight was a busy night. With formal cooperation with the Republic of Komi ratified, there seemed to be no end to his work. Organizing the military? Sure, the old Union trained him to be the best at his job. Diplomacy, however, was another matter. Zhukov found the diplomats of the Republic insufferable. He endured them only for the sake of the alliance. Otherwise, he would not have bothered.\n\nThey were not as considerate to Zhukov, however. This morning, the diplomats arrived with an outrageous demand: to commission two of the paramilitary leaders of the Republic's Left. At first, Zhukov took it as what it was: nonsense. They would make good commanders for the Front's urban assault units - but generals? No. And Zhukov told them so. Displeased by the Marshal's frank, honest answer, they kept on insisting on Varennikov and Oplesnin's candidacy to the generalship of the Front. Again, for the sake of the alliance, the Marshal relented. He agreed to give their credentials a look-over.\n\nZhukov concluded that, in certain situations, both of these would be competent generals for other states. Within the Front, however, these qualifications change. No soldier of the Front would serve under commanders who they regard as having proven themselves only on the streets of Syktyvkar, and not through proper academic and officer training. He could use them for the Front's less critical assignments, or not use them at all - but he'd rather not accept unqualified officers into his staff.\n\nThe question returns. Would he make a stand, or will he relent?"
 zhukov.8.a: "Relent to the request."
 zhukov.8.b: "Take a stand."
 zhukov.9.t: "Unifying the General Staff"
 zhukov.9.d: "Not for the first time, the Grand Marshal found his patience tested by the politicking of generals. The terms he'd agreed with Vasily Ivanov and the rest of the Vologda clique were very straightforward. Even so, with an agreed-upon plan for how their command structures were to be unified, he still found his generals bickering over questions of precedence, prestige and seniority in the new central command.\n\nUnlike in earlier times, however, he wasn't very concerned about underlying tensions in his staff. His leadership of the Front was secure, and while some resentment at Ivanov's earlier hesitation lingered on, Zhukov was confident it would dissipate as the armies from Vologda settled into the wider Front. Ivanov and his officers were well liked by their men and popular in the wider population. The sooner they were seen to follow his directions, the more it would strengthen the Front's legitimacy as the continuation of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut first, it seemed, he needed to settle some disputes."
 zhukov.9.a: "It's like herding cats..."
 zhukov.11.t: "The Syktyvkar Trials"
 zhukov.11.d: "In the former-Republic of Komi's Supreme Court, the Front had set up trials for the members of the Komi government. By order of Marshal Zhukov, the Front's jurists laid down the laws and charges against the defendants. Among those charged were the President of the Republic and the cabinet, as well as the members of the Legislature. The jury consisted of a mix of Komi citizens as well as veterans of the West Russian War.\n\nIt had taken weeks of preparation to prepare for the trials. Along with gathering witnesses as well as assembling the jury, the Front had also made a list of allegations leveled against the defendants. Chiefest of these were treasonous acts against the Union - to whom the Front claimed to be a successor. With such a preponderance of evidence, there can be no doubt as to the verdict.\n\nAt the end of the week-long trial, the judge gathered the Komi government before him. All, from the President to the Republic's ministers and the Deputies of the National Assembly unfortunate enough to get caught, stood with chains to their feet and wrists.\n\nThe gavel struck. \"In the name of the West Russian Revolutionary Front,\" the judge said, his voice echoing in the mostly-silent courtroom, \"I pronounce you guilty.\" The verdict was inevitable, but what shall be its punishment?"
 zhukov.11.a: "Imprison this lot. Time outside politics may well do them good."
 zhukov.11.b: "No mercy for traitors. Have them shot."
 zhukov.12.t: "The Syktyvkar Trials"
 zhukov.12.d: "The Front's first act in Ust-Sysolsk was to restore its former name. As a sign of goodwill for the natives of the area, Marshal Zhukov approved of a return to \"Komi\" as the region's name. The Front and its leadership hoped that such a symbolic gesture would begin the easing of tensions between Russians and the ethnic Komi. After all, what were the Komi but comrades-in-arms from with another name?\n\nThe perpetrators of the crimes against the Komi, however, did not fare as well. Since the Front's victory, they had been shunted off to prisons within the former Republic of Komi, each waiting for the day justice would come to them. Meanwhile, the Front prepared its jurists, its jury, and the list of allegations and charges it would level at the defendants. Marshal Zhukov and the staff felt the need to expose their crimes and, in the process, assure the world of the Front's legitimacy. After a few weeks, the Front declared that the trials would officially start.\n\nToday, the trial reached its conclusion. The judge, a veteran from the West Russian War trained in Soviet legal proceedings, struck the gavel. \"For crimes committed against the people of Komi, as well as treasonous acts against the doctrine of socialism and for making war against the sole legitimate authority of the Union, I sentence you to death.\""
 zhukov.12.a: "Justice is served."
 zhukov.13.t: "The Syktyvkar Trials"
 zhukov.13.d: "When the Front first learned of Komi's new government - a socialist state built on the foundations of the Soviet Union - its soldiery and officers were ecstatic. The Marshal officially extended an offer of cooperation to the Republic, sure of their answer. However, the envoys returned rebuffed, their terms rejected. The answer was clear: the Republic of Komi was no longer an ally, but enemies. At the outset, however, the Front still maintained some form of respect for their fellow socialists.\n\nWhen the Front entered Syktvykar, however, they were greeted by horror. Not only had the Republic and its organs of state acted against the legitimate successor of the old Union, but also its beliefs. The Republic of Komi had embraced total and complete revisionism, going contrary to the ideas of Marx, Lenin, and Bukharin. Without delay, the Front prepared a trial to expose these violations. Chiefest among the charges were treason against the Union, as well as the revisionist and unorthodox practice of socialism.\n\nThe gavel struck. The verdict was inevitable. The Front, its jurists, and its jury found the collective leadership of the Republic guilty. All that remains to be decided are the punishments. Perhaps a time of hard labor would reform these dissidents. On the other hand, there are scarcely better guarantees of silence than a bullet. The judge pronounces their claims, and the punishment was decided."

 zhukov.14.d: "From his seat on a truck bed, Anton looked at the monastery in the distance as it rose against the flat forests and low hills of Gayny. It was a beautiful country. The warrior-monks of the Order of Saint George called the fortress-monastery Squirrel's Nest. Anton smirked. For all their pretensions of sagacity and wisdom, they could not come up with a better name than a child would.\n\nAgainst the Revolutionary Front, however, the Order could not have come up with a more antithetical opposition. One side believed that religious life was everything to man. The other dismissed it, citing Marx's label of \"opiate of the masses.\" He felt pity rise in his heart as the truck trudged through the rough, hastily erected roads into the wilds of Gayny. Holding a photo of his sweetheart from so, so long ago, Anton felt that he understood the monks better. He, too, would have prayed to a thousand gods beneath the sky if it meant meeting her again.\n\nHe felt the winds brush against his face, their touch cold and harsh against his cheeks. Looking around him, he found his companions and comrades in a similar, somber mood. No one liked a task thrust upon them at the early hours of the morning. He looked at his feet, just below his seat. Explosives, box-shaped. He remembered his sergeant's orders.\n\n\"Take up everything you can,\" the man said, his voice rough and raspy, perhaps a keepsake from his time in the West Russian War, \"manuscripts, crosses, robes, everything that has value and,\" he pointed to the explosives, \"blow up everything that doesn't. Orders came from higher up. The monastery is in the way, so we are getting rid of it.\"\n\nThe words seeped to his mind as his hands and fingers ran through his equipment. Triggers, the explosive load, as well as safety equipment. He peered up. They were getting close."

Hundreds of peasants tilling the fields in preparation for this year's seeds, as well as the sunny, bright, and cheerful look of the farmers. A long time ago, before even the Great War, he was raised in such a household. It was a memory that kept him going through the harshest decades of Russian history. From the loss of its pride to the Germans at Brest-Litovsk, the Revolutions of 1919, and the ongoing Great Patriotric War, the image of the Union drove him forward. One, indivisible, inseparable, and invincible.\n\n\"Hoy,\" a peasant said, addressing the Grand Marshal, \"Marshal, sir. Do you have time?\" The peasant accent was something familiar, yet faint in Zhukov's memory. He felt home there, somehow, among the copper bodies and calloused hands of the farmers, in the middle of sunlight and patches of melting dew and morning frost. One of his staff members strode forward, intending to shove the peasant away.\n\n\"Don't bother the Marshal with your inane quest-\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said, \"sorry, I wasn't paying attention. The countryside is beautiful this year around. One can hardly resist not getting lost in its allure. Your question was?\"\n\nThe peasant began his litany of complaints, censorious and critical against the previous government's shortcomings. In a dramatic flourish, the Marshal whipped out his notes and pencil and started to write. Keeping up appearances as usual - though admittedly, the people who lived the land might know how to run it best.\n\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" he said, after wasting three pages of notes, \"I'll make sure that the Front takes care of your concerns. Would that be all?\" The peasant nodded, and the Marshal shook his hand. \"Thank you,\" the Marshal said, \"Were it not for your efforts we would starve.\""
 zhukov.15.a: "A successful public performance."
 zhukov.16.t: "The WRRF Demands Reunification"
 zhukov.16.d: "\"Huh? What did you say?\" Averin said, emerging from underneath the tracks of his tank. Oil, petrol, and mechanical lubricants stained his overalls. Needless to say, it better be important. The Tank Bandit had more important business to settle that day, and servicing his tank was the least of it. The messenger, a boy, around 19 years of age - probably the sights on some other tank's crew - was trembling. Averin knew he had a reputation, but he did not take pride in introducing fear to some young pissant's pants.\n\n\"Y-yes, sir,\" the young man said, \"a message, sir. From the Revolutionary Front.\" This kid had better be kidding. The Front was nothing. Nothing. Nihil. Now, this brat came up to him and started bringing it up again. He took off his work gloves and placed them neatly on a table. Averin gritted his teeth. Yet another matter to handle before the day ended. Averin was a man of two duties: a savage tank commander, but also a leader. If he were to be honest, he hated the latter part of his job. Running a brigade full of what an outside observer would term \"free spirits\" - what Averin would personally call a hive of scum and villainy - was entirely different from commanding a tank. Not everyone followed orders, much to his chagrin.\n\n\"Well?\" he said, \"spit it out. I haven't got all day, and this tank isn't even halfway done.\"\n\n\"Essentially, sir,\" the kid stammered, \"they gave us two choices: surrender or death.\" Averin groaned. The day was getting longer and longer by the minute. He considered. He would love to test his tanks against the Front's out there in the field. On the other hand, he would rather play it safe, rather than gamble his life, livelihood, and hobby in one fell bet.\n\n\"All right, kid,\" he said, \"here's what I am gonna do...\""
 zhukov.16.a: "Maybe it's time to hang up old grudges."
 zhukov.16.b: "Let their tanks come to us, and we'll smash them to bits."
 zhukov.17.t: "Gorky Refuses!"
 zhukov.17.d: "The Marshal of the Front stared at the map. Specifically, he was looking at the black botch of it, like a tumor growing out of Moskowien's field-grey Eastern rear. The headquarters were silent tonight, and only he was up. Zhukov had predicted that Gorky would decline to join the Front. If they had found the Front so agreeable the first time, they wouldn't have left. Sipping a cup of coffee, he saw the troop positions of his and his enemy's. Knowing one's adversary was, after all, the sure way to victory.\n\nHe placed the cup down. Only one thing bothered him. Gorky was a site for the pre-West Russian War tank factory, and out there, in the fields, the Front would face its equal. He thumbed through a file filled to the brim with reports of troop readiness, equipment levels, as well as morale. Everything looked to be in place for the Front's triumph, so long as no one attacked him from the rear. Gorky's supply of tanks might seem enormous, but a city alone cannot sustain the needs of a tank army.\n\nHe placed his index finger on the lines that would penetrate the Tank Bandits' territory. The Marshal was above all a veteran, of two finished wars, and one that still burned in his mind. He could imagine the difficulty; tanks were mighty behemoths of the field. Without support or special equipment, taking them down would be very challenging. Zhukov would not be a marshal for long, however, if he did not trust in his soldier's morale and skill. The decades where warlords would rule the old Union was coming to an end, and if Gorky would stand against the will of the ages, they were welcome to be ground to dust."
 zhukov.17.a: "Averin had left us no choice."
 zhukov.18.t: "Gorky Agrees!"
 zhukov.18.d: "\"General Averin!\" Marshal Zhukov said, greeting his new comrade, \"welcome to the Front.\" The two men could not have been more dissimilar from one another. Zhukov stood erect, his dark uniform almost gleaming in the sunlight. Medals, a few of them decorated his chest. Here was one for the West Russian War, and one was for his continued service for the Union during the ongoing Great Patriotic War. Striding forward to shake Averin's hand, he was struck by how dingy and dirty the man looked.\n\nThe leader of the Tank Bandits, seemingly, did not realize the momentousness of this occasion. He wore his overalls, blotched in shades of pink and black of oil and mechanical lubricants. On his beard were dust, and to the naked eye, it appeared coarse and rough. His speech was no different from his mien. \"Hoy,\" he said, \"Zhukov. How long has it been? Four, three years? I figured it'd be nice to finally not under machinegun fire for once.\" Grasping the Tank Bandit's hands, Zhukov felt how strange his palms were. Simultaneously rough and smooth, and a little slippery. He let go of it as quickly as he could.\n\n\"I've been well, General Averin.\" in the confines of his office, Averin's smell was overpowering. Less sweat, and more of gas, petrol, lubricants, and oil. The Tank Bandit was living true to his name - he made the Marshal's office smell like a tank factory. \"Sit down, please, while we wait for tea.\" A luxury, but Zhukov would rather spend a fortune to acquire the Bandits' allegiance than lives. He could not afford to lose any more veterans and skilled soldiers.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the Bandit said, his accent no less refined from before, \"I am happy to be here.\"\n\nIt was going to be a long day."
 zhukov.18.a: "At the very least, there is peace."
 zhukov.19.t: "The WRRF's Ultimatum"
 zhukov.19.d: "The West Russian Revolutionary Front has come forward with an outrageous demand today. Through cable and their diplomatic channels, they have issued an ultimatum. Accept integration into the Front, like the old Union times, or war. Many in the government have made their decision clear. Defiance. If the Front intends to take our independence, their reasoning goes, they have to come and pay for it in blood.\n\nAmong the Russian populace, however, there is dissent. A war would lead to the devastation of the countryside, and what casualties the Republic would lose it would never fully recover. Not to mention, that under the WRRF, there would be protection against other, worse forces in the area. The Aryan Brotherhood and the Russian Liberation Army do not present themselves as the best neighbors, after all.\n\nSo the choice is thus: to fold or to take a stand."
 zhukov.19.a: "Resist."
 zhukov.19.b: "Yield."
 zhukov.20.t: "The Tatars Defiant"
 zhukov.20.d: "Marshal Zhukov found himself in the map room of his office. Again. Every time one of the warlords rejected his pleas for peace, he retreated there. It had become a refuge of sorts. Here, he could plan for contingencies. Besides, the comfort the caffeine and nicotine provided helped soothe the pain of having to send more soldiers to the frontlines. Putting down his cup of coffee, sizzling and fragrant, he eyed the map.\n\nGreen. The Tatars had chosen to be insolent and defiant against the Front's will. Rejecting the Front's reasonable offer of autonomy as well as protection from its neighbors, it had instead chosen to turn against its only potential benefactor. Foolish move. Perhaps, to the Tatarstan government's mind, it was more romantic to die on the battlefield than surrender their newly-gained independence. No matter. They had become adversaries, foes; in this matter, the Front has made its stance clear.\n\nHe gathered his pieces and assembled the plan of attack he had in his mind. The Tatars' small, defensive army will not stand long against scrutiny from an actual offensive army. Cigarette in one hand and a pencil in the other, the Marshal started on his work."
 zhukov.20.a: "Tatarstan shall fall."
 zhukov.21.t: "A Dinner in Tatarstan"
 zhukov.21.d: "Tonight was a historic moment in the history of the Front and the Republic of Tatarstan. Both parties have ratified a Treaty of Friendship, and dinner commenced afterward. Sitting at the center of the party, Zhukov couldn't help but feel that everything was dull. The food wasn't anything to write home about, and the place wasn't as glitzy and prestigious as he had hoped. He recognized the significance of the party, however. Tatarstan had peacefully joined the Front as an autonomous Republic. No men died, only spattered ink over an arbitrary piece of paper.\n\n\"How did you find the meal, Marshal Zhukov,\" the President of the Republic, sitting on the other end of the table, said, \"do you find it to your liking much?\"\n\n\"Uh,\" the question took Zhukov somewhat by surprise. Collecting himself, he said, \"yes. I find it quite delicate and excellent. Please pass my compliments to tonight's chef if you would, sir.\" It was edible, but if the chef had deigned to serve Lenin with it, he would be taken out back and shot.\n\nIt was going to be another long night. Zhukov sighed, sotto voce. At least no one would die over a dinner. Well, unless the food turned out to be even worse in his stomach."
 zhukov.21.a: "Another evening survived."
 zhukov.22.t: "Movements on the Border"
 zhukov.22.d: "Vladimir awoke with the chime of a telephone. Sitting upon his bed, he drowsily let the rings time out, but they still came and came. Finally, he put his hands on the receiver and lifted it to his ears. The Emperor of Russia gazed absently into the night, his eyes following the undulating motions of the curtains. Vladimir watched as the winds lifted and returned it into its place, over and over. He shivered. A servant had neglected to close the windows.\n\nOver on the receiver, however, was a buzz. Vladimir put it closer to his ears, and the buzzing became murmurs, and the murmurs became shouts. Panic had taken grip of the other end. \"Sir, sir!\" a voice said, its details blurring with Vladimir's breathing, \"sir! Are you all right?\" He had to answer now, lest they send a servant over to propel him to into consciousness. Using his fingernails, he pinched his upper left arm. A groan and he was there, the Emperor of Russia restored to his natural place among the realm of the living.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said to the mysterious, nebulous, and blurry voice, \"I am here. What is happening?\" He could not wait to go back to his bed. Alas, if they were calling him this early in the morning, he probably would not. All he thought of was coffee and some cigarettes, and some time to prepare for the day ahead.\n\n\"I apologize for interrupting your sleep, sir.\" Why are they in such a hurry? \"But an emergency. We have to evacuate you. Immediately.\" Can't it wait? \"The Revolutionary Front has been seen encroaching on our borders, sir. We have to get you to safety before anything happens.\"\n\n\"Send a couple of servants over,\" he said, his speech slow and his words slurry. \"I'll be ready in a couple of minutes.\""
 zhukov.22.a: "Heavy is the head that wears the crown."
 zhukov.23.t: "The Fate of the Royal Relics"
 zhukov.23.d: "Anton looked on as they piled the royal relics high. Crosses, crucifixes, manuscripts encased between covers of solid gold, jewelry, and many, many more. Indeed, the Romanovs had amassed quite the wealth since returning to Russia. The pile of treasure reminded Anton of dragons, and now they had found the lair of one and slain it.\n\nAnton leaned forward and picked up a small notebook, barely the size of his palms. Its cover was leather - smooth, almost-soothing to the touch. His fingers flickered through the pages, and Anton realized that the paper was creamy, expensive. No writing graced its empty grasslands of white, no hill; no mountain. No ink painted its canvas, and no vistas described in its pages. In its hollow form, it was beautiful: complete in its incompleteness. The book enchanted him, and he slipped it to his uniform. No commanding officer would resent him for keeping a book stolen from right under the Emperor's trove of loot.\n\nFor the rest of the day, Anton helped with the orderly recollection of the treasures. He kept the book close to his chest. After everything was done, he approached his commanding officer. \"What to do with all this loot,\" he said, \"sir?\"\n\n\"Well, the high command had been unclear on that,\" the sergeant said, \"They uh...\""
 zhukov.23.a: "\"...want to liquify all these assets.\""
 zhukov.23.b: "\"...want to maintain the cultural value these objects possess.\""
 zhukov.24.t: "An Unexpected Displeasure"
 zhukov.24.d: "What a mess this was. Ivan didn't know what a car full of armed reactionaries was doing out here in the sticks. They'd been just as surprised to find him and his squad, however, which had made for a hard-fought battle.\n\n\"We found the last of the enemies, sergeant. Uh, you might want to see this. Dmitry thinks it's him. The traitor Tsar. He's been shot up, though. I left him with Dmitry, over that way.\"\n\nThat explained what the tsarists were doing out here, at least.\n\n\"I'll go, but you need to see to Petrov in the meanwhile. Keep the pressure on that wound. Tight! Or he'll start bleeding again.\"\n\nIvan made his way over to Dmitry and the prisoner.\n\n\"Are you sure it's him?\"\n\nThe soldier nodded. Ivan gave the man a thorough look to make sure. There was no question. The bound person in front of him was indeed the traitor Tsar, dying from his wounds by the look of him.\n\nThe man drew gasped weakly, every breath shallower than the last. It wouldn't be long. Ivan couldn't stand the sight of him. The man that had brought untold misery and war on the motherland lying in a pool of his own blood. He would die from his wounds here, having never faced trial. The injustice was sickening.\n\n\"Move him over there, comrade.\" Dmitry had to pick up the wounded man to move him, staining his coat with blood in the process. It matched Ivan's now, bloody as it was from when he'd cradled the wounded Private Petrov. The sergeant pulled out his pistol. He'd made a decision.\n\n\"Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, you are a known fascist collaborator and traitor to the motherland. The punishment is death.\"\n\nThe man was already half-dead when the gunshot ran out.\n\n\"Help me gather everyone, we need to get going if Petrov's to make it.\""
 zhukov.24.a: "The end of the line."
 zhukov.25.t: "A Partisan Stronghold"
 zhukov.25.d: "Viktor looked at the site of the battle. As a member of the Marshal's staff, he was tasked with gathering data from an engagement with the monarchist and revisionist partisans in the countryside. The very notion of resistance surprised him. Weren't the Union beloved, a symbol of defiance against the Nazi Germans? Why would the people turn on them now, and support the reactionaries and the traitors? He shook his head. Maybe he would never understand.\n\nHe stood, his foot ankle-deep in the mud. The rains had made the ground wet, and if he were not careful, he would sink. He looked at the truck that brought him here. Its wheels dug into the mud, and no motion of the engines could unclasp nature's grasp. Before him, stood the remains of the compound the partisans used as a hiding place for their insurgent acts. An old settlement from the Soviet times, abandoned during the bombings. He could see the shattered facades of buildings on the streets, and shards of brick and wood crunched underneath his foot as he walked by.\n\nWeapons. Dead bodies. The Front had long since cleaned after its own dead. For these people, however, there was no such luck. Their emperor, gods, ideology - it did not matter - had abandoned them. Left them for dead. He set out his notes and camera, the tools of his trade. It was time to go to work."
 zhukov.25.a: "Gruesome work, but necessary all the same."
 zhukov.26.t: "The Partisans on Trial"
 zhukov.26.d: "Four men marched slowly forward in the woods, their feet and hands linked by chains. The bights clinked to the tempo of their steps. Behind them was Viktor and a squad of local Front soldiers tasked with guarding this lot. These men were partisans of various groups. On their uniforms were patches that declared their allegiance: the VTNS, Komi Republic's assortment of paramilitaries, and others still. It did not matter to whom they belonged. In Viktor's mind, they were all traitors, fascists, and revisionists.\n\nOn a clearing up ahead was a court held for this occasion. The judge, a captain of the Front dressed in uniform, sat on a metal chair. The Front's military law book lay on a table before him. Around him, gathered in a cluster, were his appendages. Court notaries, stenographers, and a jury made out of random farmers and scavengers the Front had accosted to serve jury duty. In a civil court, these partisans might have stood a chance. Once it was in the military's hands, however, no matter how formal the Front had arranged the trial to be, the verdict was sealed.\n\nViktor felt pity for these men, even as he volunteered himself to stand witness and testify against them. They were kindred, countrymen. Misguided? Maybe. Guilty? Almost definitely. They couldn't have known, however, that they were on the wrong side of history. Even as the bights clinked and the leaves underfoot crunched under the steady stream of steps, he felt pity.\n\nThus the trial proceeded. Witnesses took the stand, and the defendants defended themselves - to no avail. The gavel struck, and the judge pronounced their guilt. Viktor awaits, with bated breath, for the sentence to be read. The hollow, empty forest rustled, as a pregnant silence reigned in the court."
 zhukov.26.a: "Death."
 zhukov.26.b: "Hard labor."
 zhukov.27.t: "Moving the Capital?"
 zhukov.27.d: "With the defeat of the Tsardom of Vyatka and the Republic of Komi, a question arises among the ranks of the Front. The Front's current capital, located in Arkhangelsk, is hardly the most hospitable place. Cold weather, rough terrain, and distance from other urban centers of West Russia had rendered it almost obsolete. The high command now considers moving - but to where? Fortunately, with the defeat of our adversaries in the region, we have a few candidates in mind.\n\nThe first one is the city of Syktyvkar. The former capital of the Front during the West Russian War, a move here would have deep symbolic value. Beneath it also lay the former Republic of Komi's supply of chemical weapons: useful to deter any intruders from entering it. However, the city has a long tradition of paramilitarism, and it might be best not to jeopardize the nerve center of our government.\n\nFurther south is the Rykov, or in Tsarist terminology, Vyatka. It is a more central location, located near the Siberian railways and the Izhevsk manufacturing plant. The infrastructure of the area would mean that supplies would get to our soldiers quicker. The location is an issue, however. If the Germans came knocking, they wouldn't have to go far to knock the Front's government down.\n\nLastly, there is the old reliable, Arkhangelsk. Located far away from any urban areas of the Front, its position had become untenable with the availability of more suitable candidates. However, its isolation and the rough terrain that surround it would serve to slow down any enemy that intends to defeat the Front.\n\nThe choice is the Marshal's - where should we go?"
 zhukov.27.a: "Remain in Arkhangelsk."
 zhukov.27.b: "Move to Syktyvkar."
 zhukov.27.c: "Relocate to Rykov."
 zhukov.28.t: "Freeing the Camps"
 zhukov.28.d: "\"So, old man,\" Anton said to the newly-freed prisoner, \"how are you feeling on this day?\" The man only nodded; a vague gesture of positivity was all that Anton needed to know. They sat in front of a munitions factory, the man's former workplace. Well - workplace would mean that the Brotherhood employed him. Instead, he was their slave. On his back, between his shoulder blades, was a black mark in the shape of a swastika.\n\n\"It's fine if you don't want to talk about it,\" Anton said, \"I understand. You have seen things other folks haven't.\" In the man's eyes were a particular kind of hollowness. Disbelief reigned in the void where emotions should have been. \"Have another one of these. And don't eat too quickly!\" Anton broke off a piece of the bread he held in his hands and gave it to the man. While the latter ate ravenously, Anton observed. The man's teeth had gaps, and in places, some of it hung precariously from their gums. \"What's your name?\" Anton asked, out of whim.\n\n\"Alexei,\" the man said, proceeding to devour his food. He did not pay any heed to Anton before he finished. \"I-\" Alexei started his words halted at the precipice of their tongue. He seemed to consider his words. \"Thank you.\" He then caught Anton in an embrace and began to sob.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Anton said, \"it's all right.\" Nothing in the world could erase what the man had gone through. It was the least that Anton could say and do."
 zhukov.28.a: "Scars upon the Russian psyche."
 zhukov.29.t: "The ASSR System"
 zhukov.29.d: "\"Thank you, thank you,\" Zhukov said, shaking hands with the representatives of the autonomous republics, \"for your service to the Union.\" In the cramped space of his office, there was nearly not enough room for his high command and the people from the SSR. Today would begin a lengthy series of negotiations between the Tatars and the Bashkirs - minorities in the Front - with the government of the Front. Zhukov would only serve as a symbolic head this time, his military experience unneeded when it came to civilian affairs.\n\nHis Premier told him that he would handle things on his end. Zhukov believed him. All that he needed to do was dictate the limits of the terms and let the Premier do the magic. There was a well-established model they could follow, that of the old Union system. It was only a matter of ratification and paperwork. For this morning, he needed only to observe and note the flow of negotiations and intervene when it became too hardline for his tastes.\n\nSo far, however, it was going smoothly. The Premier and the ministers of the future SSRs were friendly with one another. The terms, advanced by both sides, were readily accepted and put to paper. In Zhukov's mind, it was how the future Union should be. One where his presence wouldn't be needed. One where the military would only serve as an arm of the Party. He smiled as his Premier handed him a piece of paper and signed it without a shadow of a doubt."
 zhukov.29.a: "A premonition."
 zhukov.30.t: "The Day of Judgment"
 zhukov.30.d: "Ivan sat on the floor, his ears pressed against a wall made of corrugated metal sheets. He and his companions had hastily made this compound as a base of operation against the communists. Alas, the Revolutionary Front found where they had hidden. He was a member of the Liberation Army, recruited when the ROA \"liberated\" his village. A boy of around nineteen-years-old, Ivan did not have anywhere else to go. No relatives, with a senile mother and dead father. He joined the ROA to make a living for himself.\n\nThe sounds of battle were getting closer. The wall wasn't much impediment to the crack of rifle fire and blasts from mortar shells and grenades. It would be his first engagement, and most likely his last. Yet, a kind of serenity passed through him. His breathing was steady, and his heart did not give way to fear or excitement. He was calm. Death was coming, and he was ready. His life - what little there was - flashed before him. A childhood sweetheart, whose name he had long forgotten. His mother, who he had left behind. The tree where and his pals had played under. Above it all was a gentle, gentle whistling, shriller and shriller by the second.\n\nHe found himself flung away from his seat. He tried to sit up, failing again and again. He could not feel his legs. When he raised his hands to look at them, he found the left one a bloody, ashen stump. Ivan resigned himself to his fate, as his ears rang, his mind praying for peace to finally come home to Russia."
 zhukov.30.a: "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
 tukharegional.1.t: "A Meeting with the Stavka"
 tukharegional.1.d: "The room the Grand Marshal waited in was austere. Outside of a long table adorned with maps and papers of all kinds, there were little comforts besides the wooden chairs. Silence reigned in the brightly lit room for a moment, as he stood.\n\nThen, they flocked to him, marching in as one. Generals, officers- all members of his general staff, saluting and taking seats before picking up dossiers with different titles. \"WAR PLANS\", one read. \"ECONOMIC RENEWAL\" read another. \"SECURING CONTROL.\" \"IDEOLOGICAL DOCTRINE.\"\n\nAll read what was inside the folders. Occasionally, a show of praise exited one member's mouth, or a brief question corrected within seconds. The Stavka were his men; and they would lead by example.\n\n\"What do you think?\" Tukhachevsky asked, though while his ears heard the assent, his eyes were looking out the single window. With the first of many productive meetings over the Stavka filed out, leaving the Grand Marshal looking out to the horizon."
 tukharegional.1.a: "Russia calls."
 tukharegional.2.t: "Rebuilding the West"
 tukharegional.2.d: "Despite the lack of civilians in any position of power within the new stratocracy, the Grand Marshal is aware of the current role that the people play - and more importantly, of the hardships they have suffered before and during now. Thus, one of the first things on his agenda is a set of massive sweeping construction and food allocation programs.\n\nFrom rubble, factories are built. From ashes, food lines are formed, with the army making sure the rations are equal. No one has too much or too little in the Grand Marshal's eyes. Any complaints are silenced, any unruliness is dealt with, and quotas are set.\n\nNo one needs to ask what happens to those who fail the quotas - but the harshness of rebuilding is for a good cause. Most are aware of what a rebuilt Russia means for their families, their friends, and themselves. So, a taxed construction worker ignores the lack of breaks, a mother waits her turn in the food line with an empty stomach, and a soldier keeps everything orderly, even as his thoughts linger less on the people he is supervising, and lean more towards hoping the food lines provide."
 tukharegional.2.a: "In the end, it will all be worth it."
 tukharegional.3.t: "Old Man Lobanov"
 tukharegional.3.d: "Andrei Lobanov was once a young Russian patriot devoted to the ideals of Bolshevism. When the Great Patriotic War broke out, Andrei was among the first in line to volunteer to join the Red Army. Even after he was hospitalized for an explosion, he insisted that he could continue to fight. When the war was over, he joined Yegorov's West Russian Revolutionary Front with his belief in communism driving him forward. He'd preach to his fellow soldiers with a copy of the communist Manifesto in hand, and he'd say that they only needed the words inside this book for guidance. With yet another defeat at the hands of the Germans however, his faith in Communism began to waver. Andrei realized he had no home to return to, and there was a chance he would never see it again. He had spent 20 years in the Red Army and had nothing to show for it.\n\nOld Man Lobanov walked through the streets of Arkhangelsk with nothing but a cane and a backpack. In reality, he was in his fifties, but he didn't look like it with the way he walked. As he walked, he considered that perhaps things would've turned differently if he had retired earlier instead. He might've been able to raise a good family and had a stable life far away from the cold and icy streets of Arkhangelsk. Lobanov placed his cane besides him and stopped to rest on a concrete staircase. Snowflakes began to drift down from the skies as he closed his eyes.\n\nWhen Lobanov opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a Red Army commissar with an envelope in his hand. The commissar simply said \"This is for you.\" before handing him the letter. The commissar then walked down the sidewalk with 10 other envelopes just like it. Lobanov opened the envelope, and inside was the first pension he had ever received. While not much, this was the first time in 10 years that Lobanov felt hope, hope that he could forge a new life beyond Arkhangelsk. He picked up his cane and walked down the sidewalk with new determination."

 tukharegional.5.d: "The Grand Marshal was seated in front of the members of the Presidium in the hall. A major new economic plan for the following year drafted by Tukhachevsky had just been announced in front of the Presidium, and now, the members were in deliberation. Finally, the Presidium reached a decision, and one of the senior members rose to speak. \"The Presidium of the West Russian Revolutionary Front has come to the agreement to veto the proposed economic plan for critical reasons including a lack of protection for workers' safety and an insufficient supply of steel currently. For this reason, the Presidium recommends immediate amendments to the plan.\" He sat back down, and the hall was filled with silence as all the members watched Tukhachevsky as contemplated before he stood up. He silently nodded before signaling his guards. The members watched in shocked silence as the Grand Marshal walked past them."
 tukharegional.5.a: "No man rules alone."
 tukharegional.6.t: "The Presidium's Proposal"
 tukharegional.6.d: "The new economic proposal was to build a new railroad stretching from Arkhangelsk to Samara stretching 1,800 kilometers and using an estimated 10,000 workers. After enjoying overwhelming support in the Presidium, it soon reached the desk of the Grand Marshal. Tukhachevsky read the proposal 3 times before making a decision, but ultimately, the plan was stamped with a veto. At the next meeting of the Presidium, furious members presented a list of grievances against Tukhachevsky was presented, but it was simply dismissed by a \"light\" reminder that he was their superior."

 tukharegional.8.d: "Leon Trotsky was greater than an ordinary revolutionary: he was the paramount leader of the Red Army. He was a hero that stood by Lenin during the October Revolution and defended the revolution during its early days by reforming the Red Army from a band of rag-tag militia to a regimented and disciplined army. His theories of permanent revolution aligned with Tukhachevsky's goal to spread the revolution through the Red Army, but while Trotsky's writings generally aligned with Tukhachevsky's own beliefs, the endless books of theory were lacking in areas of military and economic organization.\n\nThe Grand Marshal began to search through every word that Leon Trotsky had ever written, yet he could find nothing. After reading a sixth book with yet more useless theory, Tukhachevsky realized that he could not rely on the advice of the great men of the past. Revolutionaries write theory describing only their own observations, and Trotsky could not possibly have foreseen the Front's present situation. Tukhachevsky had to make decisions in the dark based only on his own experiences. Leon Trotsky set down the path before him, but only Tukhachevsky could continue walking."

 tukharegional.9.t: "Protecting the Revolution"
 tukharegional.9.d: "This is the story of a man named Andrey. Andrey was an average to middling man who did very, very little in his life. He was not particularly brave, or particularly exemplary in any field, but he was smart. At least, smart enough to follow orders and keep his head down. Dimitry - one of his comrades was not particularly smart. A generous, popular man who occasionally sparred with the commissar and tended to win arguments, Dimitry led by example.\n\nThat is until one morning when Andrey awoke in his bunk to find four men in uniforms he did not recognize in the dimness of the early dawn moving around. \"Get up.\" One spoke, as he moved without thinking. Out the door he walked with the rest of the squadron into the dim light mere minutes later, barely dressed. The uniformed men were joined by six more- all wearing SMERSH badges. Andrey had heard the stories of the secret police - counter intelligence squadrons. However, he did not expect them to be as equipped or as funded as the stories claimed.\n\nThe only other man besides the SMERSH operatives fully dressed and crisply awake was the commissar, and he was beaming as one spoke to him. \"You have done well to inform us of treason within this unit.\" \"We will make sure that no problems arise.\" \"Your loyalty shall be rewarded.\" All stated, as Dimitry and his friends were dragged out of the line. What happened next clicked for Andrey in a single moment, as the operative next to the commissar turned.\n\n\"Men. It has become apparent to us that there is treason within your unit. Thanks to the reports of a few dutiful soldiers, these traitors to the socalist revolution will be transferred to where they can cause no harm. In a few hours, you will be questioned.\" The operative spoke calmly, with a smile.\n\nDimitry and the soldiers closest to him were taken, and then came the questions. \"What is your opinion of the Grand Marshal?\" \"Where were you or relatives located during the West Russian War?\" \"Do you know anyone who may have counter-revolutionary ties or sympathies?\" Each and every minute, they had a new one. And Andrey?"

As such, citizens must aid the Red Army in whichever way they are able,\" read the official speaking on top of the platform. A small crowd had gathered to watch the first reading of the new Soviet constitution which would be enacted soon after the Front was dissolved. He continued, \"All Soviet citizens have the sacred duty to defend the motherland. Treason to the country - deserting the Red Army, impairing military power, and espionage is punishable with all the severity of the law.\n\nArticle 5: The Red Army's sole goal is to defend the revolution against reaction and spread socialism on Earth. The Grand Marshal may exercise his authority to overrule the civilian government if it is beneficial to this goal. The Grand Marshal can also take direct control of the country during times of revolutionary war against capitalist and fascist threats.\n\nArticle 6: All Soviet citizens have the right to participate in government. Red Army soldiers and veterans possess a higher right to serve as government officials and be elected as they have proven themselves as revolutionaries who are willing to fight to protect socialism.

 tukharegional.20.t: "Excerpts from an Essay"
 tukharegional.20.d: "\"The Second International therefore, in its struggle with imperialism, understandably defended the militia system. This system became the tradition of the socialists. Gradually the real purpose of an army was forgotten; an active socialist war was not thought of, and the fundamental task of an army was considered to be what would disturb as little as possible the economic life of the country...\n\n...The guarantee of the existence of the soviet state is the main task; everything else - even economic requirements - must give way to it...\n\n...The quality of an army lies above all in its combat-readiness developed to the highest degree and in its precise and easy mobility. It is not easy to fulfill these requirements, and that is why they involve a long hard period of preparation. Only a regular army can receive such training. We thus observe that a Red Army can be only a regular army...\n\n...In view of this, every task of our republic must be most closely bound up with the tasks of the world revolution. This is, naturally, particularly valid for the question of the organization of our Red Army, the first cadre-troops of the World Red Army... Only such an army, composed of class-conscious revolutionaries, can be the instrument for the propagation of the world revolution and for the destruction of capitalism.\"\n\n- M.

 tukharegional.21.d: "Creaking door hinges interrupted the pen scrawls that filled Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky's office. He glanced up from his paperwork and glared at Comrade Ustinov approach, a folder nestled against his arm crook. \"I haven't got all day, Ustinov,\" he said. \"Speak up.\"\n\nUstinov cleared his throat as he read from the document. \"Work on integrating the liberated zones continues apace, Comrade Grand Marshal,\" reported the general. \"Food and materiel from the revolution's opponents are now being repurposed to the Red Army's needs at breakneck speed. My analysts estimate we will replenish our stockpiles within the month.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\nOld paper flipped, its contents keenly scanned by bespectacled eyes. \"The civilians. Rather, their economic activities - farming, industry, commerce - which the war has disrupted. Stavka awaits your advisement.\" Comrade Ustinov proffered the folder containing the rest of his report. \"For your reading pleasure, Comrade Grand Marshal.\"\n\nInspection revealed that they also contained recommendations - two, in particular. The first suggested reintroducing old Bukharin's legacy to the Soviet proletariat, with the rationale of easing their burdens while the state rebuilds itself. The second contained less theory and more bluntness: collectivization of all war-critical resources at the Army's custody.\n\nIt took a minute for the Grand Marshal to skim through the detailed hundred-page document. He returned Ustinov's imperturbable gaze with the Red Army's inviolate orders."

And now that he found himself face-to-face with the officer announcing his fate, what else could a simple farmer do but nod?\n\n\"By order of the Grand Marshal,\" continued the military man, \"your farm has been reappropriated for the revolutionary war effort.\" The words he read from the paper on his hands sounded distant, almost disinterested. \"The Red Army will supervise its conversion into productive kolkhoze. You've been instructed to join your new brigade in the nearby village.\"\n\nHe motioned at the gunmen amassed by the lorry, who began advancing towards Oskar's house.\n\n\"W-wait!\"\n\nThe soldiers froze, giving Oskar tense stares as they leveled their guns at his outstretched arm. He gulped. \"M-my belongings, at least,\" said the farmer pausingly.\n\nThe officer glanced to his fellows, then back to Oskar. Shrugging, he barked, \"Ruslan. Grigory. Help our kulak friend here pack his bags.\"\n\nSeveral more minutes later, the new kolkhoznik was escorted from his late father's farm with nothing but the clothes on his knapsack, a rickety balalaika..."

 tukharegional.24.d: "It had taken some time to get the paperwork through - so difficult to get the Military Schools to agree to anything! - but Grigorovich had succeeded in getting Michal a day off. It was a special occasion, after all, and Michal was needed, as was everyone in the family.\n\nThey got up in the early morning, and Grigorovich's back ached like the devil as he packed the truck at the foot of his apartment. There was so much to handle - why had his grandfather chosen to go into the carpentry business in the first place? - and there was so little time to do it in. Michal groaned and dragged his feet, still bleary and grumpy from a sleepless night. Even with all the commotion, however, they managed to pull it off in under an hour. The wooden stools and turnstiles, the Venetian blinds, the cabinets - everything.\n\nAs they arrived at their new shop, a stonefaced bureaucrat walked up to them, handed them papers that seemed way lighter than was wise, and stalked off. Grigorovich shrugged and signed. As long as the shop was open, he'd always said, everything was negotiable.\n\nThe moving process was far swifter than the previous iteration. Most of the fragile wooden items had already been pre-packaged, and the only real difficulty was in moving the items that were ill-fitted to the narrow spaces of their new space. Some corridors had to be negotiated by tilting the chosen goods ever so slightly, so that they could inch into corners in the manner of a struggling grandmother.\n\nSlowly the new shop rose to completion as the sun pierced the horizon. Grigorovich took one last look at the paperwork - the New Economic Policy Committee had approved it, apparently - and beamed at his son, who was quietly shaving what appeared to be a decorative table-leg. He truly was, in the literal sense, a chip off the old block. And with the reopening of the ancestral shop, his children, too, would have a business to call home."
 tukharegional.24.a: "A heartwarming story."
 tukharegional.25.t: "A Step Forward"
 tukharegional.25.d: "Bukharin's economic legacy is...mixed to stay the least. His economic plans did little to prepare the Union for war against Germany. We were unable to provide the arms and ammunition necessary to fight back against the Nazis. This is the most shameful part of his economic legacy. But it wasn't exactly a failure.\n\nFor too long, this failure on the military and heavy industry front obscured the success in other areas. Under Bukharin, agricultural output increased, for example. And, more significantly, the Union made tremendous strides in terms of light, consumer industry. Not the industry that could kill Nazis, mind you, but the industries that provided the people of the Republics with wood, clothing, and canned foods. This turned the Soviet Union from an agrarian backwater to a nation that was industrialized, albeit at a lower level.\n\nEverything we do is for the defeat of Germany and the liberation of Russia. But we must recognize that an industrialized nation is not entirely devoted to the production of weapons of war. An industrialized nation also produces things that people can use in their daily lives. And one day, the revolution will be triumphant, and what would we do with a bunch of artillery plants then?\n\nLet us continue with these civilian industry programs. There's no reason that we cannot grow both our civilian and defense production at the same time. We will keep what worked before to make it work again. And one day, we will have a strong and vibrant socialist economy, just as Bukharin dreamed."

Agents are still currently searching for experienced engineers and scientists that could assist with our endeavors while construction crews are beginning construction of laboratories and testing sites. Factories have been ordered to produce materials that are required for early testing. SMERSH is currently investigating a possible security breach. An engineer that was recruited and screened by our agents disappeared in the middle of the night. Breach is considered a low threat as he did not possess access to any highly classified documents. Family and friends are currently being held for questioning. Individual project overviews are listed below:\n\nProject Ferment: Team members have recommended that they develop adequate containment methods before beginning research. Request is currently being reviewed by administrators. Project can not proceed before this request is accepted or denied, but test subjects are currently being acquired.\n\nProject Leshiy: Team members are currently researching samples recovered from foreign sources. The utmost caution is being applied to handling of these samples. Many scientists are experienced in chemical weapon development, and preliminary results appear promising. Minor team is currently working on methods of defending hostile chemical attacks. Experimental gas mask is currently being developed.\n\nProject Shchuka: Construction has begun on a testing area in the White Sea. Environment is harsh and hindering progress. Engineers are currently beginning experimental design that allowed for higher resistance to atmospheric pressure and greater acceleration. Despite temporary setback, the construction team is expected to be finished by time that first prototype is built.\n\n"

 tukharegional.31.d: "Drowning, he was drowning. His legs barely worked anymore, and the frigid cold seemed only to suck the life out of what was left of his torso. Oh, God, he had to get out of this goddamn river - with a gasp and a burst of savage energy he moved long-numbed arms and pulled himself another step towards the bank. Yes, the bank, and with it - oh, the relief was so painful Vladimir wanted to sob - dry land.\n\nDry land, dry land, dry land - his body drove itself like an engine running on the fumes of petrol after the last reserves. Only one thing mattered, survival, and there was exactly one path through to this goal. The rich, dry, healing touch of dry earth and snow. Vladimir heaved, heaved again and -\n\nHis hands touched, at last, the shore, and with one last twitch that took everything from him he heaved himself onto the dry land. Convulsing and vomiting, Vladimir spat and choked his air passages clean. Wiping away the last of the mucus, he looked around with the trained ease of a veteran. There, perhaps, he could build a shelter - not one that would protect from snow, but perhaps it would keep the predators away.\n\nIt was only Day Three, something in his adrenaline-soaked mind whispered. The exercise lasted five days, and he hadn't heard from anyone in his squad since the second. What the hell had happened to Military Command?\n\nHe soon got his answer: coming back from a firewood-gathering trip that evening, Vladimir noticed something bloated and swollen, in military fatigues, washing up on shore. What was left of his dinner was quickly expelled over the waterlogged remains of a man, the Soviet medal still visible on his left breast - and his dogtag strangling his fattened neck."

 tukharegional.32.t: "Hard Times..."
 tukharegional.32.d: "Tukhachevsky stood in trance, his sharp posture contrasting the rest of the Stavka that lay seated beside him. Through his binoculars he spied the massed bodies below, scared boys drawn into a frenzy as they passed through tire swings, wooden stockades and dead sprints.\n\nIn particular, he came to focus on one subject, a shivering wreck from somewhere south.\n\nLeft and right, to and fro, the poor boy's legs became stiff trunks in the mud. With each beleaguered step, the subject of Tukhachevsky's intrigue came closer to his next tumble. His comrades passed by him often, trading glances as he fell. Finally, after many failed attempts, the boy simply collapsed. Defiant in the face of duty, he lay flat and unmoving. Tukhachevsky remained still for a moment, pondering the scene.\n\nFor every hundred men dedicated to the cause, there would those who found solace in the dirt. Men that cried out in woe, decrying the miserable conditions of combat and the herculean responsibility upon their shoulders. To carry the weight of a Russian rebirth alongside your rifle and pack was no easy task.\n\nYet, despite the undeniably human state the boy found himself in, Tukhachevsky felt nothing but cold disdain for him. The life of a soldier, dying with dignity for the liberation of his home, could never compare to the collective misery inflicted upon the proletariat of the world. From the countless cripples, made prisoners in their own bodies by Luftwaffe bombs, to the near starving slaves of Germania.\n\nTukhachevsky muttered something cruel to an aid, and watched as a Commissar descended upon the motionless body below.

However, as this letter is composed in the spirit of defiance, I shall gamble against the odds. It has been long since we last spoke. Too long I fear.\n\nYour Husband, the young idealist who set off from our little Orenburg farmstead, is no more. In his place stands an absence; a hollow shell where a man ought to be. I wish I could report a feeling of glory, or some sense that we were progressing towards fulfillment of the ultimate cause. Instead, all I have to offer is misery.\n\nI am surrounded by bitter, scornful men, who do their very best to make sure each day is less distinguishable from the last. Each morning, we are rudely awoken to the sound of a commissar banging a spoon upon a metal pot. From there comes our run, a grueling miles long journey from which the only respite is the beauty of sunrise.\n\nWith little time to think between drills, I have learned the true meaning of conservation. Everything can be reused or redirected to a more opportune time, be it scraps of food, padding for boots, or even willpower itself.\n\nMy body, gaunt and slender, would likely be unrecognizable, where you to lay eyes on it again. It is foreign to me, the few times I have spied myself in reflection. It seems to move autonomously, responding predictably to the same stimuli, and directing itself to areas my authority will never reach.\n\nI will not lie and claim that there is any dignity in my routine. Truthfully, it is an alienating and sorrowful process. However, if there is anything good I can report, it is this; I know I will never be the same. With each pointless harassment, and each grueling obstacle course, I become stronger. In both mind and body, I can feel my tolerance hardening. Nothing will phase me, as I suppose it should be if I am to face the fascist hordes. May peace be with you darling, and with any luck, I will emerge from this suffering the patron of a liberated motherland."

Then he was moving forwards, crawling on his belly, his uniforms in need of a stern washing. He saw Vladimir to his left, face red with exertion, and smiled. The Moscow refugee's pudge hadn't melted off during the long trek from home, he supposed he shouldn't be surprised that it wouldn't under their hard training. Nonetheless, what his companion lacked in physique he more than made up for in muscle. When the time came for rubble drills, and they had to practice hurriedly clearing a bombed bunker, Vlad's strength would come in handy for the unit.\n\n\"UP! RUN!\" Yelled the commander, and the soldiers began to sprint to the next stage of the obstacle course. Dmitry scrambled to his feet, and rushed forwards. He remembered how he had grimaced and moaned during the early days of his service, and felt a renewed burst of speed. He found himself at the next stage, among the guns, and began to assemble his rifle. For once his fingers didn't fail him, when he looked up, he saw to his great surprise that he had finished first.\n\nLater, Dmitry and his unit would celebrate in true Russian style. There would be music, food, and a flood of vodka. More likely than not he would wake up with a nameless girl in his bed and a throbbing headache, but neither would last long through the hard soldier's life and cold northern sun.

The old high hit his brain, coloring his thoughts a faint shade of pink - although, truth be told, everything seemed a little less colorful with each passing year. Perhaps it was the inevitable result of lost youth, the passage of time, or perhaps the captain was simply getting older and crankier.\n\nHe chuckled to himself. He knew which option he'd bet money on, and it wasn't some airy-fairy nonsense about time.\n\nWell, it was lucky that he didn't need smell to help with shipbuilding. He returned his attention to the dense blueprint in front of him: the Ognevoy class was a son of a bitch to build, but no one could say it wasn't elegant. His eyes ran up and down the elegant curves of the deck, the spindly masts and the expanses of the engine and boiler rooms - yes, there was an almost sexual energy to its raw dynamism, something only he could appreciate. He'd often joked with his friends that he'd married a ship instead of a woman.\n\nIt was a shame about his own destroyer, really. It'd broken his heart far worse than the retreat to Arkhangelsk, the sinking in port. And she hadn't even fired her first volley! When the West Russian Government had contacted him with the promise of settling accounts, the captain had agreed without a second thought.\n\nNow, as he watched something larger and better than the Ognevoy class rise in the dockyard before him, the captain knew he'd made the right choice. This new beauty was not, would never be, Ozornoy. But it could be for someone else what Ozornoy had once been for him: the love of his life, and the light in his harbor."

Alone but for his thoughts, a flickering oil lamp and Shosta's Second Waltz, so far away from the sniveling idiots who call themselves Stavka - it is here where the general can ponder, reflect, and resolve his battles within and without. The written word has failed him less than his generals' own consensus on both accounts.\n\nAnd so he wrote. Past theories and present practice mingled with the ink on his fountain pen, leaving martial dialectic behind every stroke. The Red Army had fifty years of either to draw from; so it was that its battles formed the object of Tukhachevsky's reflections. The two Tsaritsyns. Moscow. Suvorov. Syktyvkar. Comparisons and contrasts between the Front and its enemy: troop deployments, tactics, supplies. Mistakes aplenty, from the first moreso. The oil lamp flickered and waned as afternoon heat gave way to evening's chill - and still Tukhachevsky wrote.\n\nOnly when he caught the Moon's pallor did the Grand Marshal stay his aching hand. Not enough, but it will have to do. Pouring himself another shot from a half-empty vodka bottle, Mikhail reclined against his seat as he read through his newest essay.\n\nAs sunlight peeked from over the Northern Dvina, Arkhangelsk greeted another day with shattering glass and discoherent screaming."

Yes, the Red Army is a Proletarian Force, and yes, we rely on our workers for all things. But we cannot expect that sending tons of differentiated men into the fray, bereft of a common drill standard, weapons handling pedigree or language, will make a difference in battle. That was what made victory so difficult, and defeat so imminent, in every battle we fought against overwhelming odds.\"\n\n\"Second, we must no longer rely on the rhetoric of heroism! It will never be enough to cast our men into heroic defeats, unless all of you want to stand on heroic gallows and call the name of Lenin as you jump into martyrdom! We have hidden behind this cowardly rhetoric and made us all laughingstocks. No, from now on we must use men smartly and precisely, or soon not even madmen will think to follow us.\"\n\n\"Finally! We must change the very nature of our soldiers themselves if we are to succeed. I spoke on quality - now I speak of organization. Gentlemen, it is time to wake your ideas up - I mean, come to your senses! We cannot claim to run a working army when we cannot even keep tabs on how many men we have employed at one time. If we can change these flaws, victory shall soon await the Stavka, and Russia.

This state, if it can be called that, shares the name and structure of the West Russian Revolutionary Front of old, but possesses a drastically more militaristic attitude towards its enemies, and a much harsher one to its own citizens.\n\nWhatever the peculiarities of this new Soviet Union, they are certainly an enemy of the Nazis, and thus share crucial interests with the government of the United States. It is for this purpose that the CIA has begun a program to send drilling equipment to this nation in order for it to reach resource self sufficiency and thus be better equipped to fight the Germans in their inevitable confrontation.\n\nThe now de-facto ruler of all of West Russia - Grand Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, appears to be a man of many talents.

Whether such things have the makings of a good ally remains to be seen, but he certainly is willing to help with our most important endeavor - the destruction of Nazi Germany and the un-making of all its vile works."
 tukharegional.40.a: "They could come in useful."
 tukharegional.40.b: "Our interests are better served elsewhere."
 tukharegional.41.t: "Letter from Arkhangelsk"
 tukharegional.41.d: "To the President of America:\n\nThe Red Army brings good tidings from Arkhangelsk. Since the restoration of order in West Russia, we have recovered much of our strength, both in men and in materiel, and with every day near the apex we had achieved under Grand Marshal Alexander Yegorov. For now our guns are pointed eastwards, at the petty warlords and revisionists who dare sully the Union's old lands - but soon the Motherland's bulwark shall return to its rightful places west.\n\nBe informed that the Red Army will gladly receive your country's military, economic, and diplomatic assistance once we resume the Great Patriotic War. You may receive further communiques from us once matters within Russia are duly resolved.\n\nSigned,\nMikhail Tukhachevsky\nGrand Marshal of the West Russian Revolutionary Front"
 tukharegional.41.a: "They could come in useful."
 tukharegional.41.b: "Our interests are better served elsewhere."
 tukharegional.42.t: "The US Agrees!"
 tukharegional.42.d: "Against the cruel, flagellating wind walked a tired crew. Fifteen weary travellers, adorned in thick fur hauled a long flat sled. As they approached the city center, sporadic cries escaped their lips; spiteful declarations against aching muscles, frozen eyelashes, and the cursed clouds above that had wrought such fortune. Slowly but surely, the men made their way towards a depot and with a lift of its large metal door, they found themselves greeted by a commissar.\n\nAlexei was not blind to the frostbitten faces before him, nor was he callous towards the wellbeing of those under his command. If today's haul was what he expected however, any amount of pain would be worthwhile. Three zip ties, a knife, and a heave would reveal what lie below the covered tarp. As the snow was brushed from the steel surface, a grin exploded Alexei's lips.\n\n\"Comrades! The American shipment has arrived!\""
 tukharegional.42.a: "Black gold for a red struggle."
 tukharegional.43.t: "The US Refuses!"
 tukharegional.43.d: "Bad news. It seems that the filthy capitalist Americans are more concerned with their petty political squabbles and oppressing the working class than actually confronting Fascism. The United States has refused to respond to our request for oil and drilling equipment, dooming the Red Army to subsistence technology, even as we struggle against the Nazi War Machine.\n\nWe will of course continue our march against chaos and Fascism alike, but without the Americans, this will be much harder. In time of course, the forces of Socialism will triumph against all of our enemies within the wasted, and then shortly afterwards in Europe. Perhaps then the Americans will finally respect the capabilities of the Red Army, and respect us as an equal, but by then it will be too late. With Socialism cemented in the old world, how long before the tides of change reach the new?"
 tukharegional.43.a: "We didn't need them anyway."
 tukharegional.44.t: "Americans Recognise Us"
 tukharegional.44.d: "Excellent news. The American Government has formally recognized us as the rightful ruler of all of Russia, a move that opens the door to greater amounts of material support and diplomatic aid in our confrontation with the Nazi war machine.\n\nAlthough some within our government had been skeptical of the willingness of the Bourgeois American republic to aid socialism, to the point of doubting the worth of asking at all, it seems that the more pragmatic direction of Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky prevailed after all, and paid off in spades.\n\nNow with the capabilities of the most powerful nation in the world behind us, is there any hope for the Nazi empire? Soon our soldiers will no longer go into battle clothed in rags and raiments, but in the finest American camouflage and flak jackets. They will no longer wield antique rifles from the last war, but M16s and high grade rocket launchers. As we have dreamed for years, the world will soon know the true power of a fully equipped and prepared Soviet Military, may the fascists and petty-despots trimble in fear."
 tukharegional.44.a: "Together, we are invincible!"
 tukharegional.45.t: "Americans Refuse Recognition"
 tukharegional.45.d: "During the last war, as the Nazi beast surged Eastwards into the heartland of the motherland, we told ourselves desperately that the Americans would not let us die. Rivals we were - on opposite sides of the line between Communism and Capitalism - but surely we thought, they would not let us fall to our mutual Fascist enemy? Surely they knew that once it had feasted on Europe, it would not be long before the Nazis turned their evil gae to the Americas?\n\nBut it seems that now, as then, we put too much faith in the United States. We had hoped that they would recognize the new Soviet Union as the rightful sovereign of all Russia, but it seems that they were blinded by their instinctual capitalist hatred of the proletariat. Had they given us the simple honor of treatment as an equal, we might have stood together, fighting as friends against the common foe.\n\nBut now, denied this most basic of requests, we are doomed once more to walk our road alone. Though our foes might proclaim this lack of recognition as indicative of weakness, we will defeat them, even if it is without allies. And then when the Fascists and madmen are defeated, we will not forget who aided us in our darkest hour, and who did not."
 tukharegional.45.a: "It was a mistake to trust these people in the first place."
 zhukovregional.1.t: "The Proud Red Army"
 zhukovregional.1.d: "The Internationale blared as Grand Marshal Zhukov overlooked the assembled soldiers, these proud sons of Socialism, faces beaming with triumph, as they presented the flags of the Front's defeated enemies, hanging low beneath the vibrant red banners of the victorious revolution. The soldiers tossed the captured standards of the enemies of Russian progress at the feet of their commanders. As each set of flags hit the cold hard stone of Lenin Square, The Marshal reflected on the reactionary regimes each of them represented. The Komi Republic, its divided, multi-colored flag, reflective of the deep divides that existed within that fractious bourgeois state. The black-gold-white tricolor of the Principality of Vyatka, representative of a decrepit collection of aristocrats so desperate to claw their way back to power they assisted the German dogs in despoiling the very land they claimed paternal affection for. The lying banner of the \"Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia\". Many Russians were seduced by Vlasov's promise of liberation, but behind that St. Andrew's Cross marched the jackboots of Fascist subjugation. On the other hand, the mad jackals of the Aryan Brotherhood, in their quest to \"purify\" the Russian nation, bore the swastika with insane, shameless pride. As the parade marched on, Marshal Zhukov noticed that the proudest faces were those of the grizzled veterans, those who remembered the West Russian War. They remembered the triumph at Volgograd. They remembered Moscow and Leningrad when final victory against the hated Germans seemed so close, only to be cruelly wretched away by vile reactionary traitors! Now, the banners of those same traitors lay at their feet, and the revitalized Red Army stood poised to cross the Urals and reunite Russia once and for all!\n\nZhukov knew that much work lay ahead of him, but today, he allowed himself to bask in the warm glow of victory."
 zhukovregional.1.a: "Krasnaya Armiya Vseh Silney!"
 zhukovregional.2.t: "High Moral Standards"
 zhukovregional.2.d: "Vasily whistled as he walked back to camp. It had been a short, victorious battle against some warlord who thought that ruling one village gave him the right to call himself a Tsar. One afternoon's work from Vasily and his comrades in the 34th People's Infantry forcefully dissuaded that would-be aristocrat from his quest for a crown.\n\n\"Hey Vasily! You only whistle when you've found something good. What is it this time?\"\n\n\"Drinks are on me when we get back to civilization, Yuri!\" Vasily said as he reached into his pocket to display his latest trophy, a small gold necklace picked up from a house he was holed up in during the battle.\n\n\"Nice! That should fetch, what, 50 rubles, at least?\"\n\n\"Maybe a little more, maybe a little less, all I care about is that this is our ticket to a proper celebration tonight!\"\n\n\"Halt! What have you got there comrade?\" The sten-faced commissar appeared from in front of the pair from seemingly nowhere. Striding up to Vasily, he snatched the golden vodka-ticket from the dismayed soldier's hand. \"Did you take this to sell, or because it brings out your eyes? Come with me, Ivanovich.\"\n\nVasily ended up in a brig that night instead of a bar. The necklace was put into a bag with several other looted baubles to be returned to the village the next morning, for as the commissar chided before ushering Vasily to his cell, \"The Red Army is meant to liberate the oppressed from their chains, not their valuables.\""
 zhukovregional.2.a: "So much for that vodka."
 zhukovregional.3.t: "A Stain on the Uniform"
 zhukovregional.3.d: "The contents of the letter from Zhukov did not come as a surprise to Tukhachevsky. The only surprise was how long it had taken to receive it. After his failed effort to take control of the Front following Yegorov's death he' half expected to be executed for treason. Instead Zhukov had seen the bigger picture and let bygones be bygones, for the moment anyway. Even his greatest rival could not deny Tukhachevsky's talents as a commander, and so he had been allowed to help retake western Russia. Now that the front was secure it seemed his services were no longer needed.\n\nThe letter accused him of \"unprofessional and reckless behavior in the field\" that was \"not suitable for an officer of the Red Army.\" Tukhachevsky knew that was horse shit and so did Zhukov. He had commanded his men the same way he always had, efficiently and mercilessly. He knew that the Union's enemies would offer no quarter in war. They hadn't the last time they invaded, and Tukhachevsky refused to weaken his forces just for the sake of appearances. Apparently appearances were important to Zhukov though, important enough to fire one of his best generals. It would not just be him either. Tukhachevsky expected many of his subordinates would receive similar letters soon, if they hadn't already. Back in the old days purges had been carried out with bullets. In Zhukov's Union it seemed they were now done with notarized letters.\n\nHe folded the letter and put it away. The end had finally come for him, but not in the way he had expected. Maybe Zhukov knew that he had expected death and decided to torment him instead. Rather than grant him a quick, clean ending, Tukhachevsky would be allowed to linger on, forced to find an answer to the question he had hoped he would never have to ask."
 zhukovregional.3.a: "What next?"
 zhukovregional.4.t: "March of the Red Army"
 zhukovregional.4.d: "Zhukov stood above the marching soldiers, watching them drill relentlessly as they had been doing so for the last hour. If they didn't have enough weapons or resources for war, every soldier would have to be well trained in elite fighting methods to overcome the enemy. One well-trained veteran was better than ten regulars in Zhukov's mind.\n\n\"Your marching break is over, back to pushups!\" Yelled the drill instructor, walking between each individual, intently making sure every man was putting in the effort. \"Come on, you can do thirty Dominik! Or do you want to do laps again?\"\n\nThere were weak links, of course, thought Zhukov. They were in every army. Some had more than others. However, the stronger each man was would help them in the field. Weakness could very well mean death. \"Instructor, I want to see these men marching again. Make it double time.\"\n\n\"You heard the Grand Marshal, march! I better not see any slow steps!\"\n\nThe tired men began to march in place once again, making sure to impress the Grand Marshal. They did not want to see what would happen if they made a mistake. Being in the Red Army sure was hard work."
 zhukovregional.4.a: "Get those feet higher!"
 zhukovregional.5.t: "Hero of the Soviet Union"
 zhukovregional.5.d: "Yuliy waited for his turn on the stage, knowing he had finally achieved his careers' dream: Hero of the Soviet Union. Saviour of Communism. One of the bravest in the Red Army. Years of fighting Germans, collaborators, and capitalists had finally paid off. As he continued to wait, he watched the group of Red Army generals congratulating the man in front of Yuliy for facing down a Finnish tank and destroying it with the only grenade he had left. The man smiled and stepped off the stage, returning to his compatriots. \"Yuliy Volkov, please come to the stage,\" said a voice from one of the generals.\n\nYuliy approached the platform, proudly walking up the stairs and grinning all the way. \"Volkov, your heroic actions in Onega are those of legend. Your story is like many others, yet incredible nonetheless. You fought bravely leading your men into Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard fortifications and creating a breakthrough into Onega. Your rescue during the ambush on the Onega Bridge will be a story told far into the future. As a private, you bravely defended your motherland in the West Russian war and fought for the good of Russia in the assault of Moscow. If anyone deserves Hero of the Soviet Union, it is you.\"\n\nPride overcame Yuliy as the medal was pinned to his chest. He knew he would continue to serve in the Red Army as the union continued to reunify Russia. Maybe they would even create a medal just for him!"
 zhukovregional.5.a: "A great story!"
 zhukovregional.6.t: "Our Two Options"
 zhukovregional.6.d: "With our two options decided, it's time we choose. Our diplomatic choice could very well determine the future of Russia.\n\nOur first option is to align with the Organization of Free Nations and America. While befriending America could come in handy with the wars against Germany and the other Russian powers, it could very well show we are betraying our very ideology. America could aid us economically and militarily, but a more socialist option is also apparent.\n\nInstead of aligning with the OFN, we could choose our own alliance, the ComIntern. Befriending other socialist nations in the world would not betray our ideology. It could also be perfect for us on the world stage, displaying our strength and socialist solidarity. Unfortunately, no ComIntern could provide what the US could, and may very well weaken us in the long run.\n\nWe must choose an approach, as diplomacy is necessary if we want any support at all in reuniting Russia. Do we choose America, sacrificing ideology for aid? Or do we choose the ComIntern, and perhaps unite the socialist world but alienate the Americans?"
 zhukovregional.6.a: "We must decide."
 zhukovregional.7.t: "Arrival in D.C."
 zhukovregional.7.d: "The plane began its slow descent to the Dulles International Airport, circling once before completing its landing. Alexander Yakovlev was glad to finally be off the long flight. His trip to America was a rather bumpy one, and he didn't usually like flying.\n\nSent to America to negotiate a trade deal and request economic aid, Yakovlev was happy to meet with the Americans. Having visited multiple times before, he was all but used to the country and its people. This time would even be an official visit! If all went as planned, he would even get to meet the President.\n\nIt was also lucky that Yakovlev knew English. He was one of the only few of the higher echelon members of the front that knew it, actually. No one really studied it back in the warlord days, and most couldn't even travel to English speaking countries.\n\nBut that was the past, and if Yakovlev was successful in these few weeks he knew a partnership that could last decades could be built between Russia and the United States."
 zhukovregional.7.a: "Hopefully the Americans greet us with open arms."
 zhukovregional.8.t: "A Historic Handshake"
 zhukovregional.8.d: "This was it, the moment Yakovlev had been waiting for. He had finally gotten to meet with the President of the United States, and they had talked about so much more than just trade agreements. There was a lot more to know about America than Yakovlev realized. And of course, he mentioned how things were back home. They were much better since the last time Yakovlev visited America, that was for sure! While his charms may have been useful in the negotiations, now he would need some different charms. The big moment was upon them. The two would appear before the press and show the world the partnership between Russia and America.\n\nStepping outside the White House doors and speaking fluent English, Yakovlev turned and said, \"President [USA.GetLeader], it's been an honor to meet you. I'm very happy about the partnership between our two nations. Open trade will surely benefit us both.\"\n\n\"I feel the same, Mr. Yakovlev,\" said the President. \"I do hope this partnership continues, and I promise I will try everything I can to persuade Congress the benefits of our alliance. I'm glad you chose to be with us to move onwards into the future.\"\n\nYakovlev held out his hand, smiling at the President and at the cameras. The President shook it as they were blinded by camera lights from the countless reporters and journalists."
 zhukovregional.8.a: "Smile for the camera!"
 zhukovregional.9.t: "Appeal for Recognition - USA"
 zhukovregional.9.d: "We have received a message from the Georgy Zhukov, Grand Marshal of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They wished to be recognized as a legitimate state, and the legitimate government of West Russia.\n\nShould we accept, it will show our close alignment with the front and may anger some of the other Russian governments and Germany. However, it will no doubt expand our partnership and may even bring the front closer to us, possibly even giving us a future ally.\n\nWest Russia is also producing a large number of goods, and recognizing their government will surely better our trade relations. However, we do not share a similar government with the front, us being a capitalist republic and them being more or less a communist dictatorship. It may go against our values of democracy, but hey, at least they hate fascists, right? Zhukov also seems inclined to reform, so it may very well be in our interests. Still..."
 zhukovregional.9.a: "Recognize them. We need as many friends as we can get."
 zhukovregional.9.b: "We should wait, Russia remains ever-changing."
 zhukovregional.10.t: "America Recognized Us!"
 zhukovregional.10.d: "It appears America has recognized our government, a major victory for us diplomatically. This means relations between us and the Americans will grow every stronger and opens up even more options for us in the future. Trade between our two nations can also increase which should hopefully help us economically. It appears sending Yakovlev has definitely increased our chances!"
 zhukovregional.10.a: "Our friends in America will surely help us achieve victory!"
 zhukovregional.11.t: "America Declined!"
 zhukovregional.11.d: "Unfortunately, we have news that America did not recognize us. While this is a blow for us on the world stage and at home, it is not a total loss. We can still get assistance out of them, such as trade deals and economic aid. This economic aid will be especially important in rebuilding West Russia. So while it may be a loss, perhaps things could change once Russia is fully reunited and America sees our true strength."
 zhukovregional.11.a: "A loss, but understandable."
 zhukovregional.12.t: "Yakovlev's Request"
 zhukovregional.12.d: "\"I must say, Ambassador, this - ah - wonton soup, is that the name? It truly is a jewel in the rough.\" Yakovlev could barely keep his mouth empty enough to speak, and the Ambassador chuckled in what was only half-embarrassment. The diner was half-empty, anyway, and it'd only been through what was essentially a bribe that the owner had been convinced to keep the store open till now. Nothing but the slow whirl of the fan to interrupt their conversation.\n\n\"It's an honor, on behalf of the staff of this restaurant, to receive you, Ambassador.\" The owner, 20-odd years of growth stacked in a stocky pile of flesh, nodded beside him with what he could only describe as a manure-eating grin. \"We welcome you to come back, should you desire it.\" The man had some nerve calling this half-baked place a restaurant (and charging like one, too) but he certainly knew how to exploit a moment.\n\nThe Ambassador waved him off. \"Mr. Yakovlev, it's a pleasure to see you immersed in our culture - but I'm sure you have bigger things you want to discuss.\" For a long while he was met with silence - only the slurping of noodles and soup echoed into the night, and the sound of the fan-blades cutting through air.\n\nYakovlev finished the dregs of his bowl, a self-satisfied smile painting his thin features, and spoke. \"Right, right, to business. You and I both know, of course, that the Union stands unsteady. We do not have the privilege of a developed economy, and certainly we do not have the grain-fields or livestock capital to make wonton as massive as the ones I just ate. To say nothing of our military...it has been a while since Soviet engineering was keeping pace with Germania.\"\n\nHe nodded to the skyline before them, a dirty-neon scribble on the windows. \"I know - and my Government is certain - that we will catch up. We must. But there is much work to be done. Can I have your assurance that the largest anti-fascist nation in the world will aid its sibling until that work ends?\""
 zhukovregional.12.a: "We will hold back nothing for our friends."
 zhukovregional.12.b: "Perhaps another day, Mr. Yakovlev."
 zhukovregional.13.t: "A Night-Time Communique"
 zhukovregional.13.d: "\"Wonton soup.\" The voice was so cold it could have flash-frozen the Volga. \"You asked the ambassador of our benefactor, the United States of America, to be taken to eat - wonton soup. Wonton. Soup.\" Silence resumed.\n\n\"I, ah, I can explain.\" Yakovlev took a deep breath. \"We had to find a place where it would be conducive to raise the sensitive topics you have mentioned. Foreign aid and soldiers, in a pricey establishment? No, that would be passé.\" Yes, this defense was going well. He pressed on.\n\n\"So I asked for something so extraordinary its location would bypass the ears of any potential surveillance. And who would think of eating wonton soup in an American city? A perfect plan, da?\" The sibilant background swallowed his words.\n\n\"We will mention this at a later stage, Alexander. For now, what news of our requests?\"\n\nThe Russian leaned close with the unthinking nature of old routines. \"I think we've got it in the bag. The Americans seem receptive, and we'll speak later in the week regarding possible air-routes for supply chains. I assume we'll clear the hurdles regarding the air-defense networks?\"\n\n\"Yes, Yakovlev. We will clear the air-routes. Assure our new partners that we will cause no trouble for them.\" Another interlude. \"Oh, and Yakovlev?\""
 zhukovregional.13.a: "\"Good job. But no more wonton soup requests, please.\""
 zhukovregional.14.t: "A Night-Time Embarrassment"
 zhukovregional.14.d: "\"Wonton soup.\" The voice was so cold it could have flash-frozen the Volga. \"You asked the ambassador of our benefactor, the United States of America, to be taken to eat - wonton soup. Wonton. Soup.\" Silence resumed.\n\n\"I, ah, I can explain.\" Yakovlev took a deep breath. \"We had to find a place where it would be conducive to raise the sensitive topics you have mentioned.

He pressed on.\n\n\"So I asked for something so extraordinary its location would bypass the ears of any potential surveillance. And who would think of eating wonton soup in an American city? A perfect plan, da?\" The sibilant background swallowed his words.\n\n\"We will - mention - this at a later stage, Alexander. For now, what news of our requests?\"\n\nThe Russian slumped towards the wall, sighing. \"The Americans have promised future discussion at a reasonable date. If I know the Ambassador like I think I do, that means we're on our own. I'm sorry, comrade.\"\n\nThe temperature between Yakovlev's ear and the phone dropped a thousand degrees. \"Your apology is registered, Comrade Yakovlev.\" Another interlude. \"It is not, however, accepted. See what else the Americans can help us with. And if you fail us - \""
 zhukovregional.14.a: "\"Neither of us will be eating wonton for a while.\""
 zhukovregional.15.t: "Ryzhkov's Tour"
 zhukovregional.15.d: "\"At ease, soldier.\" The guard relaxed and returned to his position, and Nikolay turned aside to begin rummaging through his suitcase. God, why had the Supreme Soviet insisted on lumping him with armed men on an international tour? Did they have no regard for the unwritten laws of diplomatic protocol?\n\nWell, he supposed fifteen years of isolation was plenty of time to forget the nuances of relations. Not so for Ryzhkov, however: he'd nursed his old dreams too long to erase their outlines from his mind. And while he still drew breath, those dreams of universal brotherhood, of arms interlinked until they crossed the world, would never die.\n\nHe began to fiddle with a postcard, pulling its sides until a letter fell out. Ah, his correspondence with the Premier had arrived! The afternoon meeting with the Revolutionary Secretary of State had drained him a little, but not so much that he couldn't squeeze in a few words to a friend. Perhaps he'd ask about the latest collectivization program's progress - farmers always seemed to get the Foreign Ministers going, for some reason. Perhaps they were simply easier to show off?\n\nRyzhkov shrugged to himself. It wasn't for him to dictate the policies of others. All he knew was what was best for the Union had to be what was best for the world, and he was damned if some farmers and their fields were going to get in the way of that goal. Stooping a little to let the light in, he began to write."
 zhukovregional.15.a: "Dearest Premier, the Russian people send their regards."
 zhukovregional.16.t: "We are Not Afraid"
 zhukovregional.16.d: "\"Comrades, we should be aware of our place in history. All of us recall the days of terror, when the haze from Moscow's burning and that of a half-dozen other cities was still pungent and fresh - all of us bear wounds that are unhealed. The Union broken upon a wheel of chaos, and its peoples scattered to the four winds - even now I have family that know not whether I am alive or dead. We all lost irreplaceable ideals, too - I will never take the triumph of Socialism for granted again.\"\n\n\"But it is time, like a widow throwing off the cloak of self-shame, to cast away our fears. The Fascist Wolf hovers over our land still, slavering like a beast in heat, but his chops are no longer what we had feared - it is trapped in a nightmare of its own. We must not be afraid, friends, to call it what it is! It is simply another imperialist experiment like all the rest of the armies who once dared to march into the Rodina, and like all the rest it is doomed to perish.\"\n\n\"Yes, we must not be afraid! Let us take strength, knowing that what we see before us is but the last guttering of an inferno - and in our hands are the buckets that shall extinguish it once and for all.\"\n\n\"For those who would presume to speak for, or answer to, the Fascists, I speak only this. You believed that the world would crumble before you, and for a time you were right. But the Tsar thought he would never perish, either, and Napoleon believed Russia would burn, and the Mongols believed the Rus would never rise against them. They have been wrong every single time.\"\n\n\"And you, too, will be wrong. The old dream of a Red Union, of what we once had, is waiting as the clouds gather - and we will be its harbingers.\""
 zhukovregional.16.a: "We will restore all that is lost to us."
 zhukovregional.17.t: "A Message to America"
 zhukovregional.17.d: "- To The Department of State of the United States of America -\n\nDue to perceived diplomatic instability across the world and the decline of socialist unity, the West Russian Revolutionary Front is notifying the United States of its intent to create a ComIntern, or Communist International, to unite the socialist world economically, diplomatically, and politically. It would be in the best interest of the United States and the Organization of Free Nations to bond our two alliances together to stand against our common enemy, Germany. Despite our differences, we must remain united to stand against the fascist menace.\n\nNikolay Ryzhkov of the West Russian Revolutionary Front."
 zhukovregional.17.a: "Courteous."
 zhukovregional.18.t: "A Long-Unfinished Business"
 zhukovregional.18.d: "Zhukov rarely broke his brandy collection out - the bottles were incredibly expensive, and while alcoholism was not a taboo in West Russia, decadent excess very much was. Even so, as he stared at a map of the growing Union, he thought it an excellent time to start. His armies ranged through what had once been their lands, the Politburo reported cautious positivity regarding the integration of the old peoples into the administration, and the economy was booming, too.\n\nFuck it, he whispered to himself. If you couldn't treat yourself at times like these, what good was hidden brandy in the first place?\n\nAs he poured the sweet amber release into his cup, he buzzed the receptionist. \"Tell Akhromeyev, Ryzhkov, and Yakovlev to come in. Drinks, as they say, are served.\" He hoped they'd bring their own damn glasses this time. This stuff was a pain to wash out of even one cup.\n\nAs the men saluted, Zhukov waved them down. Pouring the brandy into their proffered cups, Zhukov raised his cup in a toast. \"Gentlemen, the situation has changed. Probably for the better, but with all these complaints about farmers fucking their own farming equipment on my desk, I don't have high hopes.\"\n\n\"You know, Georgy, it might be best if you stuck to doing your actual job. They're hiring thinner comedians these days.\" The three shared a chuckle; they had always disagreed, but their shared sardonic misery kept them together.\n\n\"Well, we can't afford much small talk, even now. I've been thinking about the question of succession, and grooming my future replacement. This liver's seen too much to last through another decade, I reckon.\" Zhukov looked at each of them in turn - Akhromeyev's earnestness, Yakovlev's charm, Ryzhkov's hidden depths. Each valuable in turn - but there could only be one choice, in the end."
 zhukovregional.18.a: "There is much work to be done."
 zhukovregional.19.t: "Back in Town"
 zhukovregional.19.d: "On the day of his return to his office, Moshin made sure to dress his finest. Memories of sneering mockery echoed through his head as the restored administrator walked into the building, flashing his entrance card like it was studded with Faberge eggs. As military officers shuffled by him, hiding their ranks and names, he could barely resist the slight smile on his face from blossoming into a full-fledged grin.\n\nYes, he whispered, Party Member Moshin was coming back in style.\n\nThere was a table, right next to his office, and on it lay several Party emblems and dossiers attached. Moshin grabbed at a random one - the office goodies were always the best on the first week - and he began to flick through the fresh pages of the dossier like he owned the place. He'd always fantasised about getting a nice, cushy desk job, but the jackasses who thought they ran West Russia with their guns and their stupid army kept getting in the way.\n\nNow, however, this was his town. And he'd gotten a nice promotion in the bargain, too - the Office was his domain, prime and unmolested, and the officers who'd once bullied him were well out of the way! He hoped they'd all have their fingers rot off in the snow.\n\nMoshin plopped himself in the office, engorged himself on the biscuit stash he'd found on the way in, and was half-supine when the security staff came to escort him out. Protesting, Moshin snapped that he was a bureaucrat now, damnit! [WRS.GetLeader] had kicked the army out and men like him in. Who were they to defy authority?\n\nRolling their eyes, the staff asked him to return on Monday. The offices were closed on Sunday, apparently. Murmuring, they retreated, leaving a humiliated Moshin to walk all the way back to his home."

 zhukovregional.20.t: "Akhromeyev's Consultation"
 zhukovregional.20.d: "There is a silence as Akhromeyev approaches the Grand Marshal's office. Staffers seem to flee past him, not looking back, as if some town were being turned to fire and brimstone behind them. Generals avoid his gaze, looking down and away. Akhromeyev sighs. Zhukov is having a bad day today, and when he's in a mood the whole office feels it.\n\nHe enters the room, knowing Zhukov to be brooding as usual, and takes a gander at the strategic map. As it turns out, today's shitshow is at least decipherable: the military are complaining about border guard concentrations again. There simply isn't enough time or energy to deal with every hostile nation that now borders the rebirthed Union, nor is the road system refined enough to deal with mass transports.\n\nZhukov is, for all intents and purposes, struggling with a problem with no solution.\n\nAkhromeyev closes his eyes for five minutes, spinning the numbers through his head. Then he rises. \"I have a solution, Marshal Zhukov.\" Letting the lines spill into the air is easy: just have the garrison focus on chokepoints in so-and-so configuration, move logistics just far enough behind lines to keep them defensible, adjust troop concentrations across the direct front to favour a line-of-fire maximization -\n\nZhukov widens his eyes. The problem undoes itself like a schoolboy's shoelaces. It's brilliant, really. Rising, he bear-hugs the confused General, who pats Zhukov on the back in return. Zhukov chuckles, says, \"I know I hired the right understudy,\" and leaves the office. Akhromeyev sighs again. Helping the Marshal is easy - but tidying up after him is not."

 zhukovregional.21.d: "Olga nodded impatiently at her parents. \"Yes, yes, Mother, I understand. Now please, my friends are expecting me at 5.\" She couldn't really blame them - they were all such oldies they still feared for her safety, and the laws had only recently been changed - but she was impatient all the same, as all young people inevitably are.\n\nShe felt like something - new - was happening in her little village, all of them felt it. Like some irresistible tide flowing in from the deep north, there was no moment when she could have said the Revolution arrived, only a growing sense that it was, in some sense, already here. Restrictions were lifted on work, schooling, and now this. It was long overdue a celebration, and why not celebrate with the friends she'd made by hiding her secret life?\n\nFor all women had learned long years of secret life, in the spaces where they were barred. One could hide it well, or not at all, but one could never deny oneself.\n\nShe arrived, and found that Michal had already set up the booth: In a mockery of the higher education they were barred from, the girls had set up little badges, almost akin to the University of Syktyvkar. That was the only luxury afforded it - the rest of the table was crowded with one thing.\n\nBooks. Books on science, on literature, a couple of religious works they'd scrounged up when the local Church fell on hard times. There her friends were, in quiet celebration, focused in the quiet, revolutionary act of reading - Olga took a hardcover (a detective novel, boilerplate) and joined them."

For while the Banners of Red October fly above our HOMELAND, in the working-place and the family home it is as if the TSAR never left. Yes, Comrades - just as we were unrelenting towards the fascism that poisoned Russia's SOIL, so too must we be unrelentingly vigilant towards the HOMETOWN FASCISM of Gender Inequality!\n\nConsider, Comrades, a list of restrictions that we have removed in the LIBERATED AREAS under our control:\n\n1) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to PUBLIC OFFICE.\n2) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to vote in REVOLUTIONARY ELECTIONS.\n3) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to COMPULSORY PRIMARY EDUCATION.\n4) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to EQUAL WORKPLACE REPRESENTATION.\n5) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to JOIN UNION ACTIVITIES.\n6) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to DOMESTIC LITIGATION.\n\nComrades, it is clear that the LIBERATION of the Soviet Woman is at hand!

He was pleasantly surprised that his new office space was bigger than the one he had worked in before, when he was an archivist in the Tsarist administration at Vyatka. He had somehow always expected that the Front was stingy with that kind of thing, and that he would be somehow working in a barn with 10 other men.\n\nHe was surprised he had gotten the job at all. When the Red Army had taken the city, he had been sure that he and all the other bureaucrats would be executed along with the high up Tsarist officials, but it was not to be. Instead they had offered him a job, letting him work as an archivist for the Red Army Central Statistical Directorate. Either they desperately needed competent bureaucrats, or the Front really did rule with a very light hand. Either way, he was happy to have work. Better than being at the bottom of a ditch like the Tsar and his generals."

There were very few people there to bear witness, only a few soldiers and a clerk. Only the warlords themselves were given an audience for their trials. The one's for their apparatchiks were considerably smaller affairs.\n\nThe judge read out the charges and then the sentence: The man was found guilty by the court of treason against the Soviet Union and her people, as well as complicitly in murder, banditry, theft, as well as a dozen other crimes, all perpetrated while in the service of the Tsarist reactionary Nazi-collaborator regime of the warlord state of Vyatka. Finding no mitigating circumstances for his actions, the judge sentenced the man to death, his execution to be carried out by firing squad at the soonest possible convenience. As he was dragged out to his death, his eyes wide with fear, the man began to shout:"

Now, for those of you at home, you may be wondering what happened to the old hosts.

 zhukovregional.27.t: "新ソビエト憲法"
 zhukovregional.27.d: "Zhukov read the new constitution, being careful to make sure all was in order. Once it was signed, it could never be undone. The Front would be changed forever.\n\nOf course, the constitution would not go into effect until the Front was disbanded, and that wouldn't happen until Russia was united and Leningrad and Moscow were back in the Soviet Republic.\n\nStill, the constitution being signed off now would mean stability later. Liberalizing the union, it should make everyone happy. Limited privatization had even been argued into the constitution! Zhukov had no idea how that got past the old guard. Many were looking forward to seeing a democratic system in Russia, albeit limited, as it would only serve as controlled opposition.\n\nZhukov raised his pen and signed, hoping it wouldn't be for nothing."
 zhukovregional.27.a: "Can we even hope to see this constitution in effect?"
 zhukovregional.28.t: "未来のための憲法"
 zhukovregional.28.d: "The new constitution laid on Zhukov's desk as he made sure his pen had ink. This new constitution would cement democracy in Russia once the Front was disbanded, a worthy endeavor.\n\nUntil the Front was disbanded, however, current ways would be maintained. Democracy was too dangerous to be implemented until all of Russia was under the control of the Revolutionary Front. Once all of Russia was reunited, including Moscow and Leningrad, a future was set up of a socialist soviet democracy.\n\nA much less authoritarian union was sure to calm Russia once everything was dealt with. A military government was not necessary to rule eternally. Hopefully, until the constitution takes effect, people will remain satisfied with what has been done so far.\n\nZhukov laid his pen down on the paper and signed, hoping one day he would see it in action."
 zhukovregional.28.a: "A dream worth living for."
 zhukovregional.29.t: "現状維持の憲法"
 zhukovregional.29.d: "Zhukov held the constitution in his hands, reading the words carefully, making sure there were no mistakes. The constitution would cement communist rule in the Front and would ensure the Front would remain largely the same after Russia was reunified.\n\nIt would go into effect almost immediately, but that still meant little would change. It basically kept things as they were, and there was nothing wrong with that. What could you change with a system that needs no revision?\n\nStill, the new constitution would officialize everything, and did put many necessary rules in place for the government. Authoritarian powers would stay with Zhukov and the government, that's just how things had to be. It would keep things stable and politically powerful. People could not just govern themselves.\n\nWith one stroke of his pen, the constitution was signed off and ready to go into effect."
 zhukovregional.29.a: "Little change, but is there anything wrong with that?"
 zhukovregional.30.t: "NEPの復活"
 zhukovregional.30.d: "It is time we go back into the old days of the Soviet Union and Bukharin and reimplement one of the oldest ideas in the book - The New Economic Policy. While maybe going against our roots of total socialism, the same problem was apparent thirty years ago and solved by the New Economic Policy, at least somewhat.\n\nImplementing a system of limited free markets still under state control will be necessary if we want to build up the economy of West Russia. Ending the nationalization of industry, while possibly hurting our productivity in the short term, will see us have long term positive impacts and possibly even larger growth.\n\nIt appears a mixed economy is the way forwards now, and while we will continue to control what is necessary, private control will get a few things off our hands that we have no need to control."
 zhukovregional.30.a: "必要な犠牲だ。"
 zhukovregional.31.t: "小規模の衝撃"
 zhukovregional.31.d: "With the policy of war communism lifted, an economic shock has been felt across West Russia. The transition of a mobilized war economy to a civilian one has noticeably impacted our economy.\n\nWe may want to be more careful with our economic policy in the coming days, as anything could cause our economy to crash. Still, the economic shock currently felt has been small, but our economy remains unstable.\n\nMany are happy with the new change, however. The quick change means improvements for our civilians producing goods that could not have come faster any other way, and civilians can now keep more of what they produce. If our economy can stay stable within the next few days, it is expected that this will only show up as a small bump in our economy."

 zhukovregional.32.d: "Prav has been noticing things. Little things, but still major in his eyes. Food in the markets was less expensive. His taxes had decreased. Most important of all, however, was that he actually got to keep some of his produce. His beets, cabbages, and tomatoes used to all be bought by the government, leaving his family with little to eat for themselves. They had nearly starved the past few years if not for the few reforms the front had enacted.\n\nBut now, for the first time in years, Prav kept some of his food. While it wasn't much, and the government still bought much of what he produced, the little he got meant everything to Prav and would help him and his family get through the winter.\n\nThings seemed to get better by the day, and Prav hoped he would continue to keep more and more of his food. Maybe he would even be able to sell some of it himself! At least, Prav hoped, he would continue to be paid enough for the produce he gave to the government. He had a feeling he would, however."
 zhukovregional.32.a: "It's good to know we're doing something right."
 zhukovregional.33.t: "An Unfortunate Confiscation"
 zhukovregional.33.d: "\"You can't do this to me, to my family!\" Said Karei, pleading with the government official. \"I have seven mouths to feed, and there's barely enough food to buy in the markets, can't I keep more?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, but you're only limited to five bushels of wheat and ten stalks of corn,\" said the official, looking bored and absolutely hating his job.\n\n\"Just that to feed my entire family for the winter! It's impossible! I thought Zhukov promised we would get to keep more of our food, but you're just taking it away again!\" Karei was on the floor now, they had promised they wouldn't take as much this year! But now they were back, asking for it all once again.\n\nThe official cleared his throat, growing more and more impatient. \"I'm sorry sir, but more food is needed for the front. The Red Army must be fed. You'll survive. Besides, this year requires an even less extreme amount than last time, so you should be happy.\"\n\n\"Our family barely lived through last year, and this winter is supposed to be even worse! You can't agree with this, at least let us keep enough to get through the winter.\" Karei hoped the man would understand, he would have a family too, wouldn't he?\n\nThe Official got quiet for a moment, and then said, \"again, I'm sorry, but this is necessary. It's not in my power to stop it. I have my own family to feed.\" And just like that, the official walked out the door and into his truck, carrying most of Karei's produce away."
 zhukovregional.33.a: "Be happy with what you can keep!"
 zhukovregional.34.t: "Things Are Looking Up"
 zhukovregional.34.d: "People have begun to notice things looking up in West Russia. Economically, we are better off than we have ever been before and poverty has been at its lowest since Russia was last united. No longer do people have to fear if they are going to survive each day. Now, more food is being produced and new factories are creating more jobs than ever before.\n\nNew industries are also producing more goods for people to buy, increasing the quality of life all around West Russia. An agrarian lifestyle is slowly becoming an industrial one, and our economy is seeing the benefits.\n\nIt is good the people are happy, and more are seeing the advantages of communism. It is apparent Zhukov has more popularity than ever! The Marshal's government seems to be stable, and that stability is bound to continue.\n\nYet still there is much to be done to improve the economy and prepare it for reunification. There are many options ahead of us, it is up to us to choose the best one and continue the growth."
 zhukovregional.34.a: "Good to hear!"
 tukhasuperregional.1.t: "Changing of the Guard"
 tukhasuperregional.1.d: "Tukhachevsky was looking his best, his uniform crisp and clean, his medals polished and resplendent across his chest. The other generals of the Stavka flanked him to either side, dressed with similar pomp and grandeur. For a moment he felt transported to a time before the Great Patriotic War, to the bright vaults of Moscow where he spent many a night drinking and playing his violin with dear Shostakovich. A time of laughter, music, and light.\n\nBreaking out of his haze of memory, the Grand Marshal gave the signal to begin the ceremony. The band to the left began to blare the Song of the Soviet Army, while to the right two young officers began to lower the banner of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. The golden star under which he had fought for more than two decades, under which hundreds of thousands had fought and bled and died for a free Russia, fluttered in the wind and then dropped into the hands of the two men below. They folded it respectfully, and then unfurled the banner of the new Russia.\n\nThe ceremony was merely symbolic, a statement on how far Tukhachevsky's Red Army had come in its struggle to unite their broken country. The Grand Marshal would still be the commander-in-chief and de facto head of state, and the Stavka would continue to rule alongside him. Yet in that moment he knew there was still significance imbued in this event. It would signal to everyone at home and abroad that the time of petty squabbling, of warlordism, of Russian against Russian, had come to a close.\n\nThe flag of the restored Union of Soviet Socialist Republics raised triumphantly before the crowd. Between the hammer and the sickle, representing the unity of peasants and workers, rested the sword. The symbolism was lost on no one. The Red Army would be at the heart of the new Soviet Union, and it would be armed and ready for the sacred war to come. As it reached its apex, flying high above the heads of all assembled, Tukhachevsky knew that finally, the tide had turned."

Lyadov, like all the other's, had spent the morning drilling. Drilling in the morning, drilling in the afternoon, drilling at night.\n\nLyadov had just about had enough, as had many of the other men. They were all seasoned soldiers who had seen their fair share of combat in West Siberia, yet Tukhachevsky's officers treated them as if they were fresh recruits, subjected to endless drilling and the droning of political commissars.\n\n\"Not good enough,\" Savinkov began, as he always did, his voice calm and even. \"You are lethargic, dull, undisciplined. You will run the drill again.\"\n\nLyadov grew angry. They had run the drill countless times already, each time the exact same as the last. Savnikov expected the impossible. Lyadov grit his teeth and stepped forward.\n\n\"Comrade Colonel Savinkov,\" he said, facing forward. \"Permission to speak?\"\n\nSavnikov looked at him as one would look at a worm, paused, and waved for him to speak.\n\n\"Respectfully Comrade Colonel Savinkov, why must we run this drill so many times? We are all veteran soldiers, and know the drill.\"\n\nA look of unbridled rage enveloped Savinkov's face as he began to speak, his words tumbling out in a rare display of emotion.\n\n\"You have no idea what you are up against, do you? This is not a ragtag army of bandits fighting for this warlord or that warlord, killing each other over tiny scraps of useless Siberian dirt! This is the Red Army! The last true hope for mankind! And our enemy to the west is the German war machine. The most destructive army in human history, lying in wait to finish us off once and for all. If you are not prepared, and falter, even for a second, they will kill you, your families, your friends, and Russia herself, dooming mankind to an eternity of darkness!

A man in a Red Army officer's uniform stood just at the landing, his way blocked by some of the plant workers. He was flanked to either side by soldiers, their rifles as yet undrawn. As Viktor approached, the man looked up to him, and smiled in greeting.\n\n\"Finally,\" he exclaimed, raising his voice above the cacophony. \"Are you the owner of this factory?\"\n\n\"No,\" Viktor responded apprehensively. \"I am the foreman. The factory is owned by Mr. Alexander Vtorov. He is not here right now.\"\n\n\"Oh well, it is no matter,\" the officer replied, frowning slightly. \"I am here on behalf of Marshal Ustinov and the State Committee for Defence Technology. May we talk in your office?\"\n\nThe foreman scanned the soldiers. They looked like they were ready to crack skulls if ordered. He waved for the workers to part. Ordering his men to stay below, the officer followed the foreman up. The two sat across from each other in the office above.\n\n\"Ah, that is much better,\" the officer began, relieved to be off the noisy factory floor. He reached into his jacket and extracted a letter, passing it to the foreman.\n\n\"In that envelope you will find orders for the nationalisation of this plant and its immediate conversion into an armaments factory under the direction of Marshal Ustinov, and the Minister for Defence Industry. Now usually the state would send a new foreman to oversee this transition, but due to a shortage of skilled managers, you will retain your position. I will remain here to make sure everything goes smoothly. As you can see the envelope also contains specifications for a modernised Kalashnikov Automatic Rifle variant with a 5.56x39 cartridge and -\"\n\n\"Guns?\" the foreman asked, deeply confused.\n\n\"Yes,\" the officer responded, smiling. \"It's all in the envelope.\"\n\n\"But, for god's sake, this is a shovel factory!\""

 tukhasuperregional.4.t: "The Bakaly Massacre"
 tukhasuperregional.4.d: "Captain Gusarov and his unit nestled themselves halfway up a mountain looking down at the town of Bakaly, the treeline obscuring them from the people below. The partisans had been sloppy, allowing him to track them through the forest back to here. Using binoculars, he saw dozens, maybe hundreds of them walk about, guns slung about their backs, talking and interacting with the townsfolk. They evidently felt safe here, safe enough to walk about the streets without fear of reprisal. The townsfolk were almost certainly supporting them.\n\nHe turned to his unit's radio operator, Private Meledin, a young man barely out of school, and ordered for him to report that the town of Bakaly was in the hands of the partisans and that his unit would be doubling back to base. Meledin followed his orders, quietly speaking into the radio. A voice from command radioed back softly into his earset. Just as Gusarov was about to order his men to prepare to leave, Meledin turned to him, a look of confusion across his face.\n\n\"Captain,\" he said, placing his hand over his microphone so command could not hear. \"They are asking me if we are downwind of Bakaly. Why would they be asking that?\"\n\nSheer terror gripped Gusarov. What had he done? Without even waiting to give his men an explanation, he ordered them to pack up and move. He marched them hard and fast further up the mountain, as high as they could go. As he had expected, the plane arrived in less than an hour, flying fast over Bakaly. As Gusarov and his unit turned to watch it, it dropped a single payload directly on top of the town before turning up and away. It was only a few short moments before the deathly white smoke began to rise, along with the screams.\n\nThe next day, once the poison gas had cleared, Gusarov took the unit down to Bakaly. The bodies were everywhere, some caught trying to flee the town on foot, others waiting to die in their homes, all clawing for air as they died. As they reached the centre of the town, they came across the Bakaly schoolyard. Before anybody could stop him, Private Meledin took out his pistol, put it to his temple, and pulled the trigger."

 tukhasuperregional.5.d: "Marshal Dmitry Ustinov steeled himself as he entered the Grand Marshal's office. He and Tukhachevsky were on good terms, but the commander-in-chief was an abrasive, unforgiving man. He could very well have been summoned to be reprimanded for some mistake, or worse.\n\nYet when he entered he found Tukhachevsky sitting in a chair, out of uniform, stoking embers in his fireplace. The sweeping melodies of a symphony, unfamiliar to Ustinov's ears, reverberated throughout the room. Ustinov saluted, but the Grand Marshal merely turned, smiled, and gestured for him to sit.\n\n\"Comrade Ustinov, thank you for coming,\" he said as the General sat across from him by the fireplace. \"I have something of great importance to discuss. Tell me, Ustinov, what do you know of Alexander the Great?\"\n\nUstinov was confused, but answered without hesitation.\n\n\"I know that Alexander was a great general who forged an empire that spanned from Greece to India, Grand Marshal.\"\n\n\"Do you know what happened to that Empire when he died?\" Tukhachevsky responded, looking at the General intently. Ustinov shook his head. \"It fell apart, torn to pieces by his generals as they squabled over his corpse. Within a few years of Alexander's death, everything he built had turned to dust. I do not intend to make the same mistake, dear Ustinov. That is why I plan to declare an heir well in advance of my death.\"\n\nThe realisation of what he was getting at hit Ustinov like a brick wall. He intended to name him heir! He continued to listen, too shocked to speak.\n\n\"You will be that heir Ustinov. I know I have perhaps not communicated my respect for you as well as I could have, but I consider you an excellent general and a loyal comrade. You will make a fine Grand Marshal.\"\n\n\"I do not know what to say, Grand Marshal,\" Ustinov responded, stumbling over his words as a thousand thoughts rushed through his head. \"I am deeply honoured and moved.\"\n\nTukhachevsky laughed. \"Do not worry dear Ustinov, I am not dead yet!

In front of him was a large window that overviewed Arkhangelsk and the surrounding region. As he looked out, he noticed how much the city had grown since the days of the Great Patriotic War and the inevitable loss to the Germans. The USSR had broken down in the days following, with the anarchy spreading across the country. Warlords soon took the place of a government, many of them not harboring the ideals of the Union. However, in these chaotic days, Zhukov tried to stay positive, he and his armies had survived and fled to the safety of the northern regions. Hoping to one day reform and march into Moscow to free it from the dark hand of the Reich.\n\nZhukov looked through the many books he had, ones on warfare and literature. Both classic and contemporary. The study was decorated not as lavishly as some of the citizens of the Union would have thought. However it did have some of Zhukov's favorite hobbies. A fish tank was located in the room, inside was a few of the discus fish. As Zhukov flipped the cover of the last book he had, he walked back over to his desk, where he thought about the last conflict he fought against the Germans.\n\nLess than twenty years after they had been sent trudging back from Stalingrad and Moscow, the reformed Red Army had begun an attack on Moscow, hoping to free the people who had lived under the iron fist. They had made good progress at first. Zhukov had astonishingly come close to liberating the Reichskommissariat. However, the tide soon turned, and they had been pushed back. Since that day when they had been pushed back, Zhukov had still believed that they would finally win."

 zhukovsuperregional.4.d: "Jonathan Avery looked out his window of the dacha he had lived in for the past decade and a half or so. He rubbed his eyes, hoping that he wouldn't fall asleep. The CIA officer had been stuck in Russia after the West Russian War had come to a screeching halt. While he had some contact with Langley sometimes, these moments had been rare. Jonathan always had something to do however, whether it was training Russian soldiers or tending to his small garden outside.\n\nWhen the car pulled up to his house, he was surprised. Why would the government want to meet with him again. Out stepped members of the Union intelligence service. As they knocked on his door, Jonathan opened it. They said they wanted to talk, Jonathan's stomach dropped as they came in. While his Russian wasn't perfect, it was much better than some of the other agents he had been sent with. As the two men explained to Jonathan the current state of affairs in the Union, his eyes grew when he heard that the United States had recognized him. As they continued, they said to him that he would be brought to Arkhangelsk, where he would be loaded onto a plane and flown home to the states. He smiled and tears began to well up in his eyes, he would finally be going home. The two intelligence officers shook his hands and told him to back his bags, as they had come to pick him up. Jonathan rushed around the house, pulling everything he had in Russia into the duffel bag he had brought with him long ago.\n\nAs they had driven to the airport, he looked out the window. He had begun to see many exports of American culture enter the Union. From people carrying little bottles of Coca-Cola to even a few Fords on the road. As he got to the airport, he shook the hands of the intelligence officers one again. Jonathan boarded the plane, not before turning around and taking one good look at Russia before leaving for good."

 zhukovsuperregional.5.d: "Dmitri walked down the street, he had arrived back to Russia only a few months ago. He had been thousands of miles away, fighting as a soldier of fortune on the side of the Baathist forces in the Middle East. Being one of the only Russians who was in the Middle East fighting, he had to learn Arabian fast. He wondered when he first came back how easy it was to get a job, but soon after he had arrived, he had been contacted by the government to work as an instructor for the reformed Red Army to prepare them for the possible conquest of the East and the inevitable war against the Germans.\n\nAs he got down to the camp, he opened the door and entered the classroom. Many of the new enlisted recruits had been sitting in the room at the desks. As Dmitri walked in, the recruits shot up instantly and saluted him. While he had been teaching for a few weeks, he hadn't gotten used to the constant drilling of the recruits and their discipline. In Saudi Arabia, he had been used to soldiers that could be hardly even called soldiers, not the men who had assembled before him. He told them to sit back down, and then wrote on the blackboard behind him. Dmitri wrote three words on the board. Advanced Weapon Technique.\n\nLater on the range, they used some of the weapons that had been sent to them from the United States or even from the black markets that stretched across the world. They ranged from new rifles that had been bought, to scrappy-looking, but reliable machine guns that had been smuggled. Dmitri helped most of them learn how to fire and control the weapons. By the end of the day, each recruit had a basic understanding of advanced weapons. Dmitri smiled and began to walk home after finishing the class."

 zhukovsuperregional.6.d: "Zhukov said at the long table in the Presidium meeting room. As he awaited his two other deputies to arrive, he looked through his notes. The contents of them had been normal procedures. Items like what to talk about during the meeting, ideas they could bring up and how the meetings would go. He looked down to his watch, waiting for the hand to strike eleven. At this time both Yakovlev and Ryzhkov should arrive for the meeting.\n\nAs he twisted the pen in his fingers, both Yakovlev and Ryzhkov entered the room. Both of the men had an aura of power around them to the aides that had also entered the room. Zhukov's secretary gave him a note saying that all expected members had arrived here. He looked around himself, noticing some of the men beginning to talk to each other and discuss the contents of the meeting. He then began to speak.\n\n\"Gentlemen, Comrades, it is an honor to be speaking to all of you in good health. Today marks a great day for us and the Union. I have called you all here to discuss our next chapter in our government. As I'm sure many of you know, the Presidium is reformed.\" He motions to his left and right, with the members sitting on each side lining the table. \"We are meeting to discuss our government and our next course of action. We are on the verge of being very close to fully restoring the glory of our former government. Until then however, we must plan for our glorious restoration and then the Continuation of the Great Patriotic War. Like I said though, we must get to work\". Zhukov looked at Yakovlev and Ryzhkov before nodding."

 zhukovsuperregional.7.t: "Balance of Power"
 zhukovsuperregional.7.d: "Sergey Akhromeyev read the letter that had been sent to him for the third time. As he was reading it he couldn't believe his eyes. If he was reading the letter correctly, as he assured himself. The Red Army was beginning to be pushed out of the politics of the Union. He threw his hands up in the air in anger and confusion. Why on earth would Zhukov remove the military from politics? Was he a madman craving power? He was a general himself, a very successful one. All of these thoughts raced through Akhromeyev's head as he thought of a response to write to Zhukov and the Presidium.\n\nHe sat down at his desk in his office, one that was quite decorated compared to the likes of Zhukov himself. Akhromeyev grabbed some of the paper he had in his desk and began to write. While he may have not been the best man when it came to words or attempting to write convincing arguments, he was a great general he thought to himself. Before he even had written the second paragraph, he balled up the letter and threw it in the trash can next to his desk. Too bold he thought as he began again.\n\nAfter four different starts, he believed he found the letter he would send to the Presidium. However as he was finishing this letter, he realized that he should send a separate one to Zhukov himself, hopefully convincing him to let the military back into politics. The two men had been acquaintances in the years following the fall of the Union, but had grown apart. Maybe it is possible that he can persuade Zhukov by bringing up their old friendship, he thought. So he began to write another letter, again."

 zhukovsuperregional.8.t: "Army at the Head"
 zhukovsuperregional.8.d: "\"Who the hell is that?!\" asked Yakovlev to Ryzhkov. While the two men could be rivals at times when it came to power, they had seemed to be allies today. Yakovlev opened the door to the Presidium meeting room just a smidge to see who was in there. Inside he saw Akhromeyev and some of the other generals in the Union. His eyes widened and he snuck back to Ryzhkov who was standing across the hall, confused.\n\n\"Fucking Akhromeyev is here. Something happened to him and Zhukov. There's a few generals as well.\" He said to Ryzhkov. As he said this, Ryzhkov face palmed and walked to the door, preparing to go inside and have some words with the men. However, he was stopped by Yakovlev who grabbed his arm, pulling him back.\n\n\"Nikolay, there is no need to barge into the room and begin to ask questions. If anything, my friend, we should go in with an open mind. Maybe it is possible for us to learn without angering the generals.\" He said to Ryzhkov, with his hand on his shoulder, hoping to disarm the conflict. However it was to no avail as Ryzhkov brushed Yakovlev's hand off and walked into the room anyways.\n\n\"Ah Comrade Ryzhkov and Comrade Yakovlev, so good to see you two had finally made your way to our meeting, only a few minutes late,\" said Akhromeyev to the two men, as they found their seats.\n\nAs Akhromeyev began to speak, Ryzhkov was deep in thought. He tried to think of an objection but couldn't."

 zhukovsuperregional.9.d: "Ryzhkov looked down at the letter he had been sent and slammed it down onto his desk. Water Transportation? For a man of his talents? He was furious. Ryzhkov could not believe his eyes as he read what was happening before him. \"After considerable advice\" from who, thought Yakovlev. What advice was given to the Presidium on him? Who could be being such a menace that they change committee assignments. Was it the army? Could it have been Zhukov himself. Whatever the answer was, he was furious that it had occurred. Ryzhkov read the letter one more time before balling it up and throwing it into the trash. Someone else's fucking job thought Ryzhkov as he tried to get his mind off of it.\n\nAcross the capital of the Union, Yakovlev had received a similar letter. Instead of Water Transportation it was to the Committee of Coal Transportation. Unlike Ryzhkov however, he was more confused than angered. No conspiracies against him. Did he do something wrong? Did he accidentally anger the wrong person? Whatever it was, it distressed him a bit. Yakovlev had never done anything wrong, all of his work he did was to benefit the Union in any way possible. The letter however, just made him feel disappointed in himself. Whatever could he have possibly done that made the Presidium mad? Whatever it was, he couldn't let his mind wander too much on it. He frowned, feeling upset to himself, he had gotten so far. So close to being an actual politician for something important, and not a rump state located in Russia. Yakovlev went to bed trying to think of something better, hoping that the next day would bring better news."

 zhukovsuperregional.10.t: "Polarizing Posters"
 zhukovsuperregional.10.d: "\"So how do you like this one, Grand Marshal?\" Asked the artist to Zhukov, showing him a mock-up that he had drawn. An order had come down the lines of the government, asking for a request for new posters that are \"patriotic and invoke a sense of willingness\". Alek was one of the artists who had answered this call to arms. In the weeks upcoming to the showing, he had created nearly twenty different posters, all with different themes. They ranged from simple images of a unified Russia imposed with the flag of the Union draped over it, to the much more complex art of a soldier blocking a large German soldier from a family.\n\n\"I quite like the colors on the art, however, I feel that it is too brash if I am being honest with you, boy. Can I see the next one?\" Replied Zhukov. The poster was one with the flag of Reichskommissariat Moscow being melted and then the flag of the Union being formed from the ashes of it. While Alek had liked it when he had been drawing it, he couldn't disagree with the Grand Marshal on this. The colors looked very dark and brooding, compared to some of the other posters he had seen. Alek then pulled out another poster.\n\n\"I quite like this one, do you mind explaining it to me?\" Said Zhukov to this poster, unlike the others, this one invoked a sense of pride. Zhukov's interest definitely increased. The poster was a vivid one, with a man standing on a hill. Behind him was a ship in the water with its guns raised, tanks on land following him, and planes flying above him. The colors had been ones of reds and blues. The text on the bottom read \"Onwards! To the German's doorstep!\" Zhukov then smiled."

 POLITICS_GEORGY_ZHUKOV_70S_DESC: "Very few expected Russia to be reunited, and fewer still believed that it would be reunited under another Union of Soviets. And yet, despite all odds, Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov, the son of a Russian peasant cobbler, General of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and the heir apparent to Alexander Yegorov's clique, has done just that.\n\nZhukov rose through the ranks of the Soviet military, his career derailed by the invasion of Russia by the Reich. Joining the Western Revolutionary Front, a rump communist state, he was instrumental in the Western Russian War in the 50s, and while the war ended in loss for the WRRF, it broke Germany's hegemony. Falling out of favor, he was sent to the military district of Ukhta.\n\nBut with the German Civil War, his opportunities and fortunes alike expanded. Winning the power struggle against his opponent, Tukhachevsky, he quickly took advantage of the stop in terror bombings to reunite West Russia, and quickly extended this rule over the rest of Russia. His reforms have made the system more stable and prosperous, with the economy recovering from the destruction of the warlord period.\n\nRumors abound Zhukov, however. His health has deteriorated, with many of his underlings within the early days of the clique being labelled as possible successors. And then there is the matter of the border, which in recent months has seen massive amounts of build in materiel and soldiers near the Pakt.\n\nZhukov has refused to comment on this rumor."

Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky has brought the Soviet Union together, and reforged it into a great engine to propel the Red Army forward as the most powerful military force in the history of man. The \"Red Napoleon\" now turns his attention to the West, preparing for the final conflict against the Union's ultimate foe. He shall see to it that the Red Army, invincible and legendary, will achieve the victory that they were denied so many years ago.\n\nNo matter what the cost may be."

Which, to him, meant skies filled with jet-powered aircraft. All too often, however, he had to explain his ideas to lesser men.\n\nThe young engineer, newly educated but with a history of loyalty to the nation from a young age, had been working on a design for a long-range jet-powered bomber. Russia naturally needed strategic capability if it was to reclaim its natural role as a great power, and this Sukhoi was content with. He was not content, with the design.\n\nThe stabilizer the young engineer had designed was wholly unacceptable, the configuration of the control surfaces far too inadequate to provide a pilot with anything other than basic capability. A combat aircraft required more than that, much more, and he would communicate that fact. Regardless of how insistent he needed to be.\n\nSukhoi knew, deep down, that the engineer was not acting out of malice, but of simple inexperience. Apart from himself and vanishingly few others, Russians had not designed novel aircraft in many years. And so, after this design was corrected, he resolved to work to instruct this engineer, and others, on proper design.\n\nRussia would again have a grand air fleet.

I just am.\" He took another drag. \"I fold.\" He discarded his cards, keeping their faces to the ground.\n\n\"I'm here to fight for Russia.\" said Peter. \"Obviously. What other reason would you have to join the army?\" He lifted his hand to review his cards and glanced at Andrei. \"I fold. You're not taking my last cigarettes.\"\n\nAndrei smiled and gathered his prize into his hands. He picked out the cleanest one and bit into it. He leaned over to Sashura, who quickly set it ablaze, pouring nicotine and warmth into his friend's lungs."

It was the start of act four, the beginning of the end; Mikhail let his head recline, gaze up at the ceiling, and depart from his place and privilege of position. Katerina Lvovna Izmailova has just bribed the guard; in a moment, Katerina Lvovna Izmailova will see her lover Sergei for the last time. \"Seryozha, Seryozha! Everything is forgotten with you, Seryozha...\" These words mark the end of their travail, mark a flight from the prison train that carries Katerina and Sergei to a Tsarist labor camp - and, in a strange way, carries Mikhail far and away from the horrors of the front.\n\nMikhail Tukhachevsky was listening to Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk - was it music or muddle? Was he right to have saved it from the censors for that damned fool?\n\nHe was Mikhail's friend, once - or was he? Music, that damned noise, discordant, so far from consonance, such passive animosity to tonality. Shostakovich's music was an affront to all that the Red Napoleon held dear; it was blasphemy against the Soviet future the Revolution promised.\n\nWhy did he find himself missing the four-eyed idealist? Why did the record hum out Katerina's sorrows?\n\nFor a moment, Mikhail was no longer the monster under the Fascists' bed - he was a Second Lieutenant, a boy, hostage in a prison at Ingolstadt. He remembered little of that life, save one detail: that divinity, perhaps, to Mikhail, the only divinity, which kept him human in his captivity. He let his head descend, and turn to the only thing of worth in his study: a rosewood violin, stress lines creasing the service, strings nearly snapped, and, to Tukhachevsky, the one thing beautiful in the vast human desert that threatened to devour him."

The new guard and the old guard did not exchange words, and simply passed each other in silence.\n\nThe ten hour shift began simply enough, without much pain or discomfort. It was simple, and it paid well, so Belikov did not complain, either outloud or inside his own mind.\n\nHe was well rested. For the first time in a long time, he hadn't been woken up by the sound of an anti-air gun firing above his apartment building, or the sound of bombs being dropped from some fascist who thought seeing innocent people running was a good time. It was nice to not hear the screams for once.\n\nAt five hours, he ate alone, as he always did, and tried to think about what it was like elsewhere. He didn't see many new people, especially so far out here.\n\nHe was ripped out of his concentration by the sound of a plane pass overheard, and just as he began to recognize the sound as a German Luftwaffe, he felt himself falling through the flooring and onto something hard. And then metal collapsed onto him, and he felt parts of himself mixed in with the dirt and the metal and whatever else existed here.\n\nFor nine hours, he laid under the metal. In the last hour of his life, he began to smell something burning.\n\nHe died screaming."

What was it that you wished to discuss?\" replied the Grand Marshal, motioning towards a chair in front of his desk.\n\n\"I wished to discuss several flaws in how the Front is organized. Purely from an administrative point of view, I just don't believe our current model is sustainable. I understand the Red Army is crucial to our survival, but the people need their voices to be heard. The civilian populace needs more say in how things are run, our economy needs to less militarized, and the military needs checks and balances to keep it from devolving into an oppressive junta.\"\n\n\"Comrade... The reforms you're proposing are... quite extensive. Are you sure this is 'purely administrative?' \"\n\n\"Grand Marshal, I assure you I hold no ill will towards the Revolution. I merely believe that the people need to play a bigger role in it.\"\n\n\"Well, Comrade, I'll certainly consider it. However, I think we should wait until things are more stable around here before we rush into our reforms. Now, Comrade, I have lots of work to do at the moment,\" with that said, Zhukov returned to the reports stacked upon his desk.\n\n\"...Understood, sir.

Samara had once again been brought into compliance with the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and the economic minister felt a strange creeping sense of nostalgia and childhood horror slip into his gut. Samara, the city of his hated youth, the city of crushing poverty that had ground every penny and ounce of joy that the young Ustinov and his mother had.\n\nHe remembered catching rats in the dark, blinding them with a flashlight and slamming their heads against the brick walls of their hovel. Meat was scarce in those days, and bones peeked out from thin shawls of skin. Ustinov knew that he had been lucky to have rats to eat, he and his mother had heard of what other villages had been forced to do to acquire precious protein.\n\nUstinov remembered hand feeding his sick and dying mother crusts of bread and a thin rat soup, comforting the woman who had been his only true friend in his young life.\n\nThe economic minister blinked sudden tears from his eyes and swallowed his pain. Samara would be rebuilt. Russia would be rebuilt. The times of starvation and scarcity would come to an end."

The Grand Marshal had not been seen all day yesterday, and Ustinov grew rather concerned when he did not show up for the usual briefing this morning as well. One of the guards gave Ustinov a quick salute as he came closer. \"Hail, Comrade Marshal Ustinov!\"\n\nWith a slightly less enthusiastic gesture of his hand, Ustinov put the guard at ease. \"Yes, hail. Where is Comrade Tukhachevsky? I haven't seen him for over twenty four hours and I'm starting to get worried!\"\n\n\"Do not fear, Comrade Ustinov, the Grand Marshal is currently in his office. He asked that nobody disturb him until he is finished with his work.\"\n\n\"Is that you, Comrade Ustinov? Let him in!\" A muffled, raspy voice could be heard from behind the door. The guards did as the voice commanded, and opened the door to reveal a disheveled and clearly sleep-deprived Tukhachevsky. His office looked as though a tornado had swept through it, with notes and colored maps strewn haphazardly about.\n\nUstinov cautiously stepped inside, examining the chaotic scene. \"Mikhail Nikolayevich, what's the meaning of all this? You look half dead!\"\n\n\"This, Comrade Ustinov,\" Tukhachevsky began, rolling out one of the maps on his desk, \"is Operation Homecoming: my magnum opus. With this strategy, we will brush the fascist hordes aside beneath an unassailable deluge of steel.\" Ustinov stepped forward and looked more closely at the map. It was a large, precise depiction of Eastern Europe, with all sorts of lines and arrows drawn across it. \"Everything we have done has led up to this, Ustinov: our sacred war.\""

Please, keep this between us, but sometimes I get to thinking.\" He took a long drag from his cigarette, \"Kovner, the Black League, sometimes I think they might have the right of it.\"\n\nYan raised a curious eyebrow, \"that sounds something like treason, Iona. I think the same, in my darkest nights, but it's best if we keep such thoughts in our own heads.\" They sat in silence, digesting the words.

Perhaps, the time of their old contact in the Republic had come to a sudden end.\n\nAs they prepare to turn back, however, a peculiar figure approached them. Pronouncing themselves as someone representing the interest of a \"sympathetic comrade in the revolution\", it offered to honor the deal of the now late Zhdanov, and his bridge with the Revolutionary Front. While in more fortuitous circumstances such suspicious handlings of Komi were matters beyond the decisions of those transporting the goods, the hunger of the people at home spoke louder. The deal was struck, the trucks were driven further down the street, and the deal was finished, even if by different hands."

Born in Samara in 1883, at age 18, he joined the Imperial Russian Army and quickly rose through the ranks. Originally a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party prior to the Revolution, he quickly aligned with the new Soviet regime when they came to power in 1917. He served courageously during the First World War, Russian Revolution in the Southwestern Front, the Great Patriotic War and the West Russian War, getting shot more than five times throughout his long service as he often led his men into battle. Ever humble, Yegorov always downplayed his achievements, and silently suffers with the regret of his past defeats even when he himself was not at fault. Still, Yegorov never gave up even after Moscow fell to the huns. In his exile behind the A-A Line, he amassed the remaining red forces in West Russia underneath the banner of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, leading it to the cusp of victory during the West Russian War before the collaborators and reactionaries within the Front tore this away.\n\nNow nearly 80, his once more powerful grip over the Front's leadership is slipping away, with cliques of officers vying for power underneath him. The harsh climate of Arkhangelsk and his many war wounds have not helped improve his health, and the fractures within the Front continue to grow.\n\nDespite the Front's many defeats, Yegorov's resolve remained strong - at least to the outside observer. It needed to be, for the hopes and dreams of those Russians still loyal to the glorious Revolution lie on his shoulders. Only time will tell whether his successor - whoever they may be, can also hold this burden."

Parades will be held to boost the morale of civilian and soldier alike. Supply caches will be broken open and distributed. Every single resource and method at our disposal will be utilized in preparation for this war - and our inevitable victory."
 WRS_tukha_lessons_of_defeat: "Lessons of Defeat"
 WRS_tukha_lessons_of_defeat_desc: "The West Russian War was the final blow that shattered the already fractious Soviet Union. It was a failure on every single level, from the military to the Presidium itself. Most reflections and analysis of the war turn into excuses and blaming others who are dead or long-since fled.\n\nNo one will accept blame. No one will accept responsibility. Unless we want to repeat these mistakes, we must examine the West Russian War with a clear and critical eye and learn - not ignore.\n\nGrand Marshal Tukhachevsky has commissioned such an analysis on the West Russian War - and the lessons learned will be applied not just to the future war with Germany, but any wars we engage in. History will judge us, as we judge those who came before us - let it see that we learned from our failures."
 WRS_tukha_unshackle_smersh: "Unshackle SMERSH"
 WRS_tukha_unshackle_smersh_desc: "The Front has always possessed a counterintelligence organ in SMERSH - but it has been woefully ignored, unsupplied, and underutilized by previous administrations. Tukhachevsky will not make this same mistake, and will establish SMERSH as the official state security service, assuming the duties of the former NKVD and GRU.\n\nThis organization will need a leader, and Vladimir Kyruchkov has been chosen for the job, as he possesses the necessary credentials, and has proven himself as competent and loyal to Tukhachevsky. Under his leadership, SMERSH will ensure that all threats against the Front will be dealt with - be they from within or without."

 WRS_tukha_the_universal_red_october_desc: "When the vanguard of socialism fell, much of the world mistakenly believed the global revolution was crushed forever. It has been beaten, damaged, and scattered - but it has not been lost. It has not been forgotten. The revolution will begin in Russia once more - and it will be spread to the whole world.\n\nWest Russia is simply the first step.\n\nThe proletariat chaff at the shackles of capitalism, and suffer under the tyranny of fascism. They long for the revolution to come to them - but there has been no force capable of standing against these twin evils. It is this mantle we will claim - and one day, the red banners of socialism will fly from Washington, Tokyo, and Germania itself."

However, stagnation and paralysis have taken hold, following Tukhachevsky's ascension, and it is time this be rectified.\n\nThe STAVKA must be led by men who are dedicated, competent, and loyal to more that just the Grand Marshal, but the Soviet Union itself. Tukhachevsky will hold these qualities in mind as he makes his appointments.\n\nIona Yakir, Dmitry Ustinov, Vladimir Triandafillov, Yan Gamarnik, and Iorenim Uborevich will assume roles in this prestigious body. Yakir and Ustinov will also be promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union as a reward for their loyalty, competence, and dedication to the Union over their distinguished careers."

 WRS_tukha_reintroduce_the_voenspetsy_desc: "During the Russian Civil War, the Red Army faced a lack of specialists and other qualified individuals in their employ - and required a solution. This solution was the creation of the Voenspetsy, a practice which integrated ideologically compatible individuals from the Whites, who were allowed to work under strict supervision of the Cheka or commissars.\n\nWe face a similar problem today, and the Voenspetsy practice offers a solution.\n\nWe will identify and assimilate ideologically compatible specialists from defeated armies into our own. They will not be trusted with critical tasks, of course, and SMERSH will be responsible for ensuring their loyalty - but this practice will ensure that the Red Army retains as much expertise and experience as possible for the wars to come."

They will show us no consideration or mercy - nor can we to them. When they betrayed the Soviet Union, their fates were sealed, and now they must reap the consequences.\n\nAll threats to the state, and traitors to the Union must be utterly crushed. SMERSH will be given sanction to oversee operations and reprisals against the military and political leadership of the traitorous states against us.These threats will be eliminated, one by one.\n\nWhile we will be potentially depriving ourselves of expertise and experience from these defeated armies, termination is safer from a security standpoint - and it will give these traitors judgement long overdue."

 WRS_tukha_echoes_of_the_civil_war_desc: "Students of history will note the parallels between the Russian Civil War and the current situation the Front finds itself in. Poverty, inefficiencies, stagnation, our state has many issues we are only just now beginning to rectify - with the realities that we are surrounded by enemies in all directions. Yet we possess the revolutionary spirit. We possess the fervor, the will, and the desire to succeed.\n\nWe will win or die. There are no alternatives.\n\nWe cannot afford frivolous luxuries, or waste even cheap materials. Each and every resource must be found, quantified, and devoted to the war effort. The people may mourn the loss of such comforts - but those will mean nothing if we lose the war to come."

 WRS_tukha_keeping_the_red_army_afloat_desc: "The Red Army is the shield that guards the people, and without it, they have nothing.\n\nEverything must be done to ensure that the Red Army does not fall. To this end, we will encourage our citizens to donate all that they can to the cause. Every spare pot can be melted into metal for a tank. Every excess piece of clothing can be repurposed for bandages. There is much that can be given - and we expect our citizens to recognize this, and sacrifice as we all must.\n\nAdditionally, we will increase our production quotas to wartime standards, and ensure that our industries are in compliance. While this additional labor may generate resentment among the workers, it is needed if we are to succeed. The Red Army will not fall, even if we must cannibalize our state to do so."
 WRS_tukha_labor_is_bread: "Labor is Bread"
 WRS_tukha_labor_is_bread_desc: "An army that is hungry is an army that will eventually deteriorate. It will become distracted, disorganized, unfocused, and mutinous. This will be followed by a splintering and total collapse of discipline and order. An army that cannot fulfill the basic needs of its soldiers is one that cannot succeed. There can be no resource spared for ensuring our military is in the best shape possible - and this includes keeping them well-fed.\n\nTo this end we will begin an organized confiscation of grain harvested from all farmers under our authority for military usage. We have few farms in the Front, and are already stretching the limits of our resources. While these confiscations will deprive the civilians and farmers of some food, better it be them who must experience temporary hunger than the soldiers who fight, bleed, and die to protect them."

 WRS_tukha_exercise_zapad_64_desc: "The illegitimate states that threaten us have forgotten what it means to face the Red Army. It is prudent that they receive a reminder, one which will herald their inevitable defeat at our hands.\n\nGrand Marshal Tukhachevsky has authorized the organization of Exercise Zapad-64 - the largest military exercise by the Front in years, involving our best divisions who will participate in complex war games. The exercise will serve two purposes - to improve the interoperability of our own forces, and showcase our prowess to our enemies.\n\nThese demonstrations may make our enemies reconsider any military operations against us - and at minimum will serve as a message to West Russia that cannot be ignored."
 WRS_tukha_recentralize_the_ukhta_military_district: "Re-Centralize the Ukhta Military District"
 WRS_tukha_recentralize_the_ukhta_military_district_desc: "The Ukhta Military District is a problematic district, and the blame for this can be rested solely at Zhukov's feet.\n\nCorruption was rampant, Bukharinist adherents thrived, and the disease of capitalism had taken root. Be it incompetence or malice, Zhukov cultivated something that was weak, corrupt, and poisonous. His disastrous rule had but one useful side-effect - it made everyone there complacent.\n\nGrand Marshal Tukhachevsky will return the district to order. The entire rotten apparatus of Uhkta will be cleansed. The corrupt expunged, the capitalists executed, and the local military whipped back into appropriate shape. A war approaches, and each part of the Front must be equally prepared."

 WRS_tukha_the_forged_sword_of_the_working_classes_desc: "To the working class, oppression, exploitation, and terror from the state are commonplace. It is only through solidarity with each other can they defy capitalist tyranny. Yet on their own, they cannot win. Only when the state is aligned in their struggle, can they not merely survive - but thrive.\n\nThis is the mission of the Red Army. Unlike their contemporaries, who are slaves of the capitalist state, the Red Army serves and protects the working class first and foremost. They will stand, defend, and die for them, for theirs is a sacred responsibility.\n\nThey are the sword and shield of the people, liberating and protecting the worker from the wrath of capitalism and fascism. It is only the Red Army who can be entrusted with this responsibility - now and forever."

 WRS_tukha_uproot_opportunistic_profiteering_desc: "There are few among men who are more despicable than the capitalist. They are the parasites of society which drain the life, wealth, and labor of the workers for their own gain. Their roles are inherently abusive. Their greed undermines the state. Their theft deprives the people of their rightful bounty.\n\nThis exploitation will end.\n\nBukharin's experiment is over, and it is time the rightful order be reasserted. All private enterprises will be subordinated to the state, and any remaining wealth these parasites possess appropriated through taxes. We expect that most of these capitalist endeavors will submit to the state - and those who do not?\n\nThey will serve - or be made to serve."

Through the tireless work of the people, the Red Army remains supplied, equipped, and armed.\n\nHowever, the situation has intensified.\n\nOur industry continues to grow, but the costs of our military continue to outpace it. We are reaching a critical phase, and we cannot afford delays and shortages now. Ustinov has been consulted, and has assured the Grant Marshal that it is feasible to raise quotas to meet this demand. While this will increase the burden on our workers, the end is in sight.\n\nThey only need toil a little longer."

 WRS_honor_the_fallen_desc: "For the past twenty years, the Soviet people have known little more than bombings, conflict and famine. We have lost many. Not only those who fought on the front lines, but those who labored away; feeding our country and supplying our troops. Those who never gave up, even in our darkest days, when it seemed the dream of our Union would be snuffed out. Many gave their lives to the dream of workers living free from capitalism and the German yoke.\n\nTo honor these heroes, we will hold a celebration highlighting the contributions that they have made to the survival of the Front. Veterans of these conflicts will be prominently featured - and will hopefully serve to rekindle the spirit of the people, and awaken their desire to once more see the Soviet Union restored."
 WRS_instill_the_spirit_of_patriotism_desc: "In dire times like these, it is easy to give up hope. Morale has faded since the Union's collapse, even more so when the hopes of victory were dashed in the West Russian War. Our people need to be motivated if we are to have a chance at reclaiming the nation. To rekindle this patriotism in the people, we must double down on propaganda efforts and highlight the terrors of those that lie to our south. Additioanlly, with the bombings over, we can also now increase the production of goods, and distribute them safely, something that will surely only increase their spirits further."
 WRS_exercises_on_the_borders_desc: "While it is unfortunate that we will take up arms against fellow Russians, conflict between the various fiefdoms that hold values so different from us is inevitable. Our military must be ready. The Front has many veterans from the West Russian War yet we have many inexperienced recruits pouring in due to our efforts at inspiring our people.\n\nPerforming exercises then will serve as both a way to train the new recruits, familiarize them with our territory, and serve as a warning to the neighboring statelets."
 WRS_march_for_the_motherland_desc: "Previous efforts to encourage troops to enlist have been moderately successful, but it unfortunately has not led to sufficient enlistment for us to be confident in our upcoming trials. We need more manpower, and clearly must expand our recruitment efforts.\n\nParades showing the might of the Red Army, accompanied by comprehensive propaganda campaigns, and an expansion of recruitment drives, should be enough to push our recruitment numbers over the edge. That this will almost certainly increase general support for the war effort is a welcome bonus."
 WRS_ready_the_citizenry_desc: "The military might appear as the only part of conflict, but behind them are our citizens, who are just as important. The Front needs the workers to provide arms and food for our soldiers, and without our citizens, what are we even fighting for?\n\nThey too will face great trials in the wars to come, so we must prepare them for this reality. All are familiar with the constant ringing of air raid sirens and can sprint to a shelter in a moment's notice, yet there is more they can learn to better survive. By providing first aid courses to as many people as possible, the lives of our citizens and even soldiers can be saved, should they find themselves in a war zone. Finally, they also must be taught how to further ration, reuse, and stockpile goods to best weather the ever-changing supply of essentials."
 WRS_operation_beacon_desc: "No one can deny that the Front is the true continuation of the Soviet Union. We fought the Germans back to the gates of Moscow in the West Russian War. We bore the brunt of their bombing campaigns, and were hardened like iron by The Arctic. The people look to us as a vanguard, which defends the proletariat of West Russia.\n\nThe Front must further spread this message. Grand Marshal Zhukov has authorized Operation BEACON for this purpose. Distributing leaflets and materials, hijacking radio broadcasts, spreading the word of our accomplishments, and sending in agents to neighboring statelets will effectively sway their populace. When the front expands, our compatriots will welcome us into their towns, at least more so then they otherwise would. We will serve as a beacon within the darkness of Russia, drawing the disillusioned to our cause, for we are the torch that will set alight the spirit of socialism within the people of Russia once more!"
 WRS_an_invitation_for_all_of_russia_desc: "The rival governments of Russia do not reflect the values and beliefs of the people they rule over. Millions still remember the good times before the Great Patriotic War and how the Soviet Union made such progress in so little time. While our successive defeats have shaken this support, it is still widespread across the nation.\n\nSupporters of communism, and the Front hold some sway in several statelets, while within others, there are large enough numbers of Communists to put pressure on their leaders. We will invite our supporters to pursue reintegration into the Front, either through pressuring their governments or fleeing to us themselves. As little blood between the Soviet People must be spilled as possible - our true enemy is to the west, not between brothers."
 WRS_welcome_them_home_desc: "Operation BEACON is proving fruitful, with a noticeable influx of refugees and defectors pouring into our territory. We now have more hands to help our war and production efforts, yet we also have many more mouths to feed, homes to find, and families to settle - all of which makes our march south to more fertile lands even more crucial.\n\nThe recent influx of immigrants has also been a further boon for our propaganda efforts. Showing that so many are willing to risk their lives to reach our borders has strengthened our legitimacy, proving that most Russians see us as the true successors to the Soviet Union - something which will only compound as time continues to pass."
 WRS_new_approaches_desc: "The years of anarchy have not been kind to the people of Russia. Whilst many are still supporters of the cause, some have become disillusioned and apathetic, sometimes adopting beliefs contradictory to communism. This is a reality that we must deal with. Unlike the Soviets of the past, we cannot simply purge them out of existence. While we won't tolerate these heretical beliefs, to placate their followers, integrating aspects of their ideology, or making them feel heard, is vital for holding The Front together.\n\nThe tsarists and theocrats demand the church play a more prominent role within society. Liberals wish for a more open debate between different ideologies, while nationalists support emphasizing identity. While we won't capitulate to all of their demands, we can at least present an openness as a temporary measure - if one only to make their integration smoother."
 WRS_the_soviets_born_anew_desc: "While the road ahead is still long, the foundations have been laid for a new Soviet Union, stronger than before. We have and will continue to learn from the mistakes of the past. Communism will still be achieved, but the path to get there will be shaped less by ideological orthodoxy, and instead by the circumstances that we must contend with. The Communist Party itself should be a far larger tent, with more interfactional debate being tolerated, and less of an emphasis on democratic centralism. The writings of Marx, Engels and Lenin serve as a framework that we can build off of, not something that we follow to the letter. What communism will look like and how we get there should not be set in stone, but fluid and adaptable."
 WRS_increase_production_quotas_desc: "As the Front expands, we've gained access to more industrial equipment and far more fertile land than that of Arkhangelsk. Therefore, our industrial capacity has expanded, and our quotas need to reflect this capability. This will put additional strain on the workers, but this is necessary for the survival of the Front. Our enemies are larger and more experienced than the disorganized brigades we've fought before. Half-measures are insufficient - and our production must rise to meet the demands of war."
 WRS_expand_military_rations_desc: "Our soldiers, the heroes of the revolution, are at the heart of the Front. They've liberated thousands from the capitalist regimes, and tyrannical statelets that occupy the former Soviet Union - and they will be the ones to rid Russia of German imperialism. For their efforts, for their sacrifices we reward them\n\nIncreasing their rations will only further motivate our soldiers. It's difficult to fight on an empty stomach, after all. While this may draw envy from the civilians, the Red Army is vital for rebuilding a Russia where everyone is fed, and such sacrifices are necessary for this future. And perhaps, the promise of more food will incentivize our recruitment further."
 WRS_reinforce_the_railways_desc: "In the three decades between the establishment of the Soviet Union and our defeat in the Great Patriotic War, thousands of miles of railways were constructed throughout Russia. They were vital from the Union's conception during our revolution, and a critical aspect of the mass industrialization that followed. After years without a central authority to maintain them, and the sustained German bombing, they've fallen into disrepair. It is time this be remedied.\n\nWith refurbishments and reinforcements, this railway network can once again fuel the Soviet industrial machine and more importantly, supply the troops in our ongoing struggle to reunify the nation - and to one day, drive back the Germans, and reclaim all that was taken from us."
 WRS_ready_emergency_stockpiles_desc: "Russia has only known chaos for the past two decades, and this unfortunately will continue for a few years more. We must be ready to adapt and overcome the ever-changing situation on the ground as a result.\n\nBy divesting a small amount of equipment and food into a national stockpile, we will be able to withstand any unpredictable situations that we will surely encounter. Small depots scattered throughout the country will serve as a failsafe in the event our growth is temporarily stunted by famine or military defeat. Neither will defeat us. With the correct planning and strategy, we will survive anything our enemies, nature, or circumstance can throw at us."
 WRS_fortify_the_frontlines_desc: "More conflict is inevitable on our journey to reunify the motherland. Our enemies greedily eye our borders, and wish to rob us of our rightful destiny. We don't know when they will strike, or who will strike first - so we must be prepared for any scenario. Bunkers, trenches and minefields along our borders will assist in repelling any enemy attack - or positing our offensives for success. We were unprepared for the Nazi invasion once - and we will not make the same mistake again."
 WRS_operation_october_desc: "On the road to the reunification of Russia, the illegitimate warlords of the west are the first obstacle. While these warlords reject communism, many people they rule over remember the Soviet Union well, and wish for our return. This is a vulnerability Grand Marshal Zhukov has recognized - Thus he has authorized Operation OCTOBER to capitalize on it.\n\nWe will use the loyal Soviets throughout Russia to weaken our opponents from within. By helping us gain intelligence, stealing their supplies, sabotaging their war efforts, and perhaps even a direct uprising from within, they will ensure our success. A two-pronged attack from inside and outside the pretender statelets will significantly enhance our reconquest. A new October Revolution will spread to every town in Russia - and hasten the return of rightful Soviet rule."
 WRS_in_the_dead_of_night_desc: "From the shadows, our agents will infiltrate the opposing statelets, and locate supporters of the Front within them. There they will funnel their loyalty, discontent, and eagerness into organized action to further weaken our opponents. From behind the front lines, saboteurs will set back any progress the enemy makes and force them to reposition their equipment and manpower. They will also forge contacts to send information back to Arkhangelsk, improving our understanding of the on the ground situation, and provide us with knowledge of our opponents tactics. With this advantage, our enemies will fall quickly when the time comes, allowing us to more properly prepare for our more powerful adversaries."
 WRS_contact_communist_sympathizers_desc: "The Soviet Union has fallen, at least for now, but millions of faithful communists across the fractured union are still sympathetic to its cause. We are certain that at least some of them will be willing enough to continue fighting for a better Russia.\n\nOur agents will locate those willing, and any who can be brought back to the Front to directly help our struggle will be permitted. For others who wish to remain where they are, they will be organized, armed and funded so that they can undermine their illegitimate statelets from within - Weakening the warlords, for the day when the Front will come to liberate the people once more."
 WRS_sabotage_and_steal_desc: "The Front is always in need of new equipment, yet there's only so much we can produce on our own. Our newly recruited sympathizers should be put to this use.\n\nWorking alongside our agents, they'll smuggle weapons, share intelligence, and work to bring anything they can get their hands on back to the Front. What they're unable to smuggle will be destroyed, alongside sabotaging any infrastructure or industry that could make our inevitable reconquest more difficult. If we can't have it, we will make sure no one else will."
 WRS_spread_the_chaos_desc: "Operation OCTOBER nears its crescendo as the seeds have been sown for maximum chaos and disorder. Soon our agents, and communist sympathizers spread across West Russia will spring into action. First, a day of reckoning for those who lead their treasonous states, prominent government officials and military members in particular will come. We will stoke the embers of the October Revolution, instigating strikes, riots, insurrections, and even uprisings that will shake the illegitimate statelets to their core.\n\nThe enemy will be too distracted by their internal strife to fully focus on the greater threat - the military might of the Front amassing on their borders. When we strike, they'll be fighting on two fronts - and make their demise assured."
 WRS_the_union_rises_again_desc: "Our victory over the statelets of West Russia seemed inevitable to anyone with an understanding of the region, yet this does not make our reconquest feel any less glorious. The dream of a reunited Soviet Union draws one step closer. What once was a hardened, battered, and bruised clique of those still loyal to the communist cause now governs the actual beginnings of a state, facing larger opportunities - and greater foes.\n\nHowever, more pretenders lie to the east. If we are ever to reclaim Moscow from the tentacles of the German Reich, our burgeoning Soviet Republic will need their people and resources. Through peace, or through war, the rest of Russia will be for the worker. It must be! For the destiny of the Soviet people lies with us!"

 tukha.89.d: "As he sat just a few paces away from the lectern, Tukhachevsky thought that the old soldier reading the script sounded more wooden than he had expected. That did nothing, however, to take the shine off what was the defining moment of his career, the culmination of everything he had worked so hard for.\n\n\"And there is only one man who can lead us to victory.\" The soldier paused. \"Comrades, please welcome to the stage your new Grand Marshal - Mikhail Tukhachevsky!\"\n\nAs the applause began from all around the hall, Tukhachevsky rose from his chair, walking slowly to the lectern. He had climbed so far to get here, and so he was going to savor every moment of this: this, his ultimate triumph, the victory.\n\nHe took out his notes, beginning to settle into his new role, but there was no celebrating just yet: there were more trials ahead. He began addressing the gathered crowd confidently.\n\n\"Comrades!\" he said. \"I am honored to serve this great nation as its new Grand Marshal.\"\n\n\"Let me be blunt with you: this is only the beginning. We know that the Motherland must be reclaimed.\" he continued. \"We are far away from that, and there is much work to do in the days ahead.\"\n\nTheir attention commanded, he moved to conclude. \"But we are a brave people. A hardworking people. And I have full faith that we will win in the end.\" Tukhachevsky raised a fist, leading the crowd in a shout."

 tukha.90.t: "Excising The Rot"
 tukha.90.d: "From Tukhachevsky's perspective, the STAVKA wasn't just rotting - it was a outright necrotic institution whose dead flesh could be smelled across all of West Russia. It needed to be greatly reformed, if not outright torn down and rebuilt from scratch. What saddened him was that it wasn't always this way - but perhaps it could be again.\n\nShortly after he took power, he had forced the entire senior leadership to resign - formally \"relieving\" them of their duties - while replacing them with capable men who were willing to pledge their lives for the nation; for the revolution. Today was to be the first meeting of the new, reformed, STAVKA. As they were all gathered, the Marshal spoke in a formal, strong, tone.\n\n\"Yakir, Gamarnik, Ustinov, Triandafillov, Uborevich - congratulations on your appointment to this august body,\" he began. \"It is truly an honor to serve your country, and I sincerely hope that all of you recognise the opportunity that you have been given.\"\n\n\"Much is expected of you, of course. Seniority and experience is of no use if it isn't matched by ability, loyalty, and a devotion not just to any one man, but to the nation. You are leaders, shining examples of what it means to be a fighter of the Union. You must not forget that.\"\n\nNow came time to put his decisions to the test; to see if these men would perform in their roles as he expected them to. \"Here is your first mission. The hour to act is near, and so I am ordering you to mobilize our men for war. We must be prepared to take back our country.\""
 tukha.90.a: "\"I am confident that we are up to the job. Good luck.\""
 tukha.91.t: "Waking The Watchmen"
 tukha.91.d: "The young man in the large office seemed out of place, and for good reason. It wasn't just that it was his first day on the job. Really, not many would've expected someone so seemingly inexperienced to be the designated leader of the Main Directorate of Counter-Intelligence - or SMERSH.\n\nMany of the older apparatchiks had glared at him in the hallway, whispering about what strings he must've pulled to get there, what bribes he must've given. Others muttered platitudes about the foolishness of youth, pretending to drop them innocently as the young man walked by.\n\nBut neither the stares nor the murmurs bothered Vladimir Kyruchkov a jot. This was a man who lived as confidently as he did because he knew that, above everything else, he had the support of Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky himself. Yes, Kyruchkov had an impeccable record, but he was also faithful to the Marshal when few others had been. This was his just reward for all that he had done in the past.\n\nKyruchkov saw the mountain of folders stacked on his desk, and it was then that the scale of the job truly set in. This little comfortable department - where people mostly sat at their desks waiting for the work to come to them - was to take on the responsibilities of three departments at once. For most it would be daunting, but Vladimir realized why he was placed here.\n\nAfter all, it was only the foolish youth who thought anything like this could be done at all.\n\nKyruchkov took one folder, opened it, and began reading. It would take time, but he was confident that SMERSH would become what it could be - a real security service, a true bulwark against the enemies of the Front."
 tukha.91.a: "He would be up reading in the office until much later that night."
 tukha.92.t: "The Neverending War"
 tukha.92.d: "The night air seemed cold and fresh, and against it the cigarette smoke filling the lungs burned. The dark sky sparkled with a diamond scattering of stars, perfectly visible today. The world around him slept calmly, and that calmness was transmitted to Dmitriy. He knew that the war would soon begin. Just a few hours ago, the summons that came to him took him by surprise - and oddly enough, the news of his call from the reserves to the active army did not affect him much. To some extent, he even rejoiced. Olga, of course, would cry and beg him to stay when she finds out. But his eldest son will understand.\n\nThe first time Dmitriy was in the war, it was at the age of sixteen. That war had frightened and crushed him - no matter how furiously he fought for every inch of land of the Soviet Union, the gray monster of the Reich threw him back. Later the fear passed, and was replaced by rage - in the flames of which his second war took place. Together with the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he attacked the enemy, almost snatching victory with his teeth and only a little short of it. And now... Now, the war no longer frightened him - he was used to it, and was well versed in its weaving. Neither did he feel the blazing rage that blinded him and caused him to make mistakes. No, this time he felt only a firm calm confidence.\n\nAfter all, where Olga saw only his march towards death, Dmitriy saw a chance: a chance to return his family, friends, neighbors, everyone around him that bright future that was taken away by Nazis with the destruction of the Soviet Union. What is another war, when the prize is this future? For its sake, Dmitriy was ready to go through a thousand more wars. No, he will not die: the fights hardened him, made him stronger, and Dmitriy now understood more clearly than ever in his life that he would fight again and again, until finally, the victory would be achieved.\n\nThe spark of an extinguished cigarette flashed in the night, leaving the man under the glow of the stars. The thought flashed through his mind that perhaps the war never ended for him, starting when he was a boy of sixteen and continuing all these years - only subsiding for a while."
 tukha.92.a: "He would be up reading in the office until much later that night."
 tukha.93.t: "If At First You Don't Succeed"
 tukha.93.d: "Tukhachevsky found himself in a particularly good mood today, and his advisers noticed it as well. They were all seated in a comfortable room a safe distance away from today's events. From the small wry smile on the Grand Marshals' face, it was clear that the exercises were going better than expected.\n\nPrevious iterations of these exercises hadn't gone as well as initially hoped. Time and time again, they only revealed just how unprepared the army was; just how much the military somehow consistently fell short of Tukhachevsky's high standards. The final straw was when the military somehow lost at a wargame against hypothetical Samaran opponents - the military staff received an earful from Tukhachevsky that day.\n\nIf they couldn't handle the exercises, the Marshal reasoned, they would completely collapse against actual opposition, and so they redoubled their efforts.\n\nThere was no worrying about that today. The army was significantly more organized, the different branches working together smoothly and in unison. Motorized, infantry, artillery - it didn't matter, because they were all one body. This was much better, increasingly closer to where Tukhachevsky thought it should be.\n\nWhen the exercises were over, the generals approached the Marshal. They were wary at first, but from the broad smile they realized he was happy, and as he greeted them he had only one thing to say:"
 tukha.93.a: "\"Comrades: we're almost ready.\""
 tukha.94.t: "16 Nazis a Day"
 tukha.94.d: "2 rounds per minute. 120 rounds per hour. 1680 rounds per work shift. It would have been 1440 if Alexey had worked the official twelve-hour shift, instead of lingering at the machine for all fourteen hours. One round per thirty seconds. He must find a way to make them faster.\n\nAlexey was never fascinated by the ideas of the communists, but during these weeks he realized that they were right: labor ennobles. Labor brings happiness. The main thing is that you should know exactly what you are working for. Every day, one of the last to leave the workshop, Alexey was exhausted to the limit - and yet he felt real pleasure in this exhaustion. He didn't care about salary and bonuses. Breaks were only important for him as a way to relieve physical stress. When all his movements behind the machines became honed to the limit, Alexey found ways to make ammo more efficiently. Ways to teach his comrades what techniques to use in order to make their work more fruitful. He even began to explore opportunities to improve the entire production process, by sending modernization projects to the plant authorities. And all that simply because he knew exactly what he was doing and why.\n\nEach bullet produced by him would end up in magazines of the soldiers of the Red Army. With these bullets, they would stop the chaos in their land, once again uniting all Soviet people under the red banner. And with these bullets they would crush the armies of the Nazis. Even if only 1% of the bullets he forges hit their targets, it meant that Alexey was killing at least 16 Nazis a day. Every day he created death, and it didn't matter if he himself lived up to that moment or not - for each of those bastards, who terrorized his country and people, the death was already forged. And maybe today, he forged the bullet that sooner or later will penetrate the skull of the Führer himself.\n\nYes, Alexey clearly understood what he was working for. With each stroke of the machine, he heard a shot. Behind each almost completed bullet, he saw the face of one of the Nazis."
 tukha.94.a: "And without hesitation, he pulled the trigger."
 tukha.95.t: "He Had It Coming"
 tukha.95.d: "From the commander's perspective, he had it coming. They'd warned the grocer that they were coming well in advance, and the ultimatum expired forty-eight hours ago. Whether it was negligence or defiance, it didn't matter to Commander Mischa: disobedience was unacceptable.\n\nIt was closing time, and the short stout grocer stood alone at the end of the day. With a small team of soldiers behind him and a rifle in his hand, Commander Mischa approached him.\n\n\"Hello, Dmitri. You are required by order of Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky to relinquish control of this establishment to the Red Army.\" He decided to try and lessen the blow. \"Please don't make this difficult for us, and consider it an honor that your goods will be used in the service of this great nation.\"\n\nThe grocer's sharp black eyes darted from left to right. In seconds all his work - all the blood, sweat, and tears - would be taken away from him forever. It was probably no exaggeration to say that taking away the shop would be taking away his life, so the grocer did what was really the only logical thing.\n\nTo try to seize the commander's rifle and fight back.\n\nThe grocer was far stronger than expected: Commander Mischa certainly wasn't prepared for it. In the chaos of the scuffle the grocer managed to get one of his hands, then another, and suddenly the Commander felt his hands were empty.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot. Mischa remained standing; the grocer didn't. He fell to the ground, bloody hands losing their grip on the rifle. Mischa turned to his soldiers afterwards, shaking his head. \"Clean this up. Then take everything here, put it in the truck, and take it back. Damn shame about what happened.\""

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.1.desc: "Many of Zhukov's loyal staff thought that the return to Arkhangelsk would be at least a smidge more triumphant. After all, their leader had just taken control of the Front after what was a protracted (and rather messy) struggle. Many of them hadn't had a chance to rest in months, so they'd thought that they would take a break, kick back and just relax.\n\nInstead, here they were, huddled closely together in a dimly lit room. On the table was a well-annotated map of the West Russian region and its various statelets. Zhukov himself was already there before the rest of the staff arrived, and he wasted no time in getting straight to the point.\n\n\"Securing the Front took significantly longer than anticipated,\" he shook his head. \"But never mind that: it is in the past. You know why you are here today. I will require all of you to be at your best, because the task ahead of us will be more difficult than just dealing with Tukhachevsky.\"\n\nThe Grand Marshal rested a finger on the map, circling the entire West Russian region.\n\n\"Reclaiming West Russia - that is our first step to taking back our nation. We must prepare immediately. There is little time to waste, and much left to do. So much left to do...\"\n\nThe Marshal released a sigh.\n\n\"This is my first order. As Grand Marshal, I am authorizing the mobilization of all military-age men for our West Russian operation. There will be more in the future, but this will do. Dismissed! There is work to be done.\""

He wore thick-rimmed sunglasses, and gripped the lectern as tightly as he could. He seemed like he'd be swallowed up by the sheer size by the massive tide of the crowd that filled the large square for the annual Veterans of the West Russian War Memorial Service.\n\n\"Comrades. My friends. I am not much of a speechmaker, so I will keep this brief. I am nearly eighty years old, and so people ask me if I had any regrets about serving the nation. Many of my friends died in front of me - many in my arms. I could only sit and watch from my hospital bed as our nation's land was ripped away from us.\"\n\n\"And yet I would change nothing! At the end of the day, win or lose, we can say that we fought until we couldn't fight any more. The tsarists and traitors can claim no such honor.\"\n\nThe crowd sat up now, listening to the man more closely. Yes, it was shaken, but there was a clear, bright, pride there that no one could take away from it. Like the nation itself, it was broken, but it wasn't defeated.\n\n\"Russia lies shattered in a million pieces. I am too old now, and many others my age are already gone. It is up to you - the youth, the future of this beautiful nation - to reclaim Russia; reclaim this Union.\"\n\nComrade Petrov turned to Zhukov, who sat behind him on the stage. \"And I can think of no better man than Grand Marshal Zhukov for the task.

To be fair to her, the instructor (an old man with patchy gray hair) spoke softly and mumbled all his words, so she couldn't pick out much of what he was saying. It also didn't help that this was the ninth straight hour of the mandatory civilian emergency training today, and they weren't even halfway done with this particular lesson yet.\n\nAs the instructor explained the fifteen-step process of administering a bandage, her eyes found themselves involuntarily glancing at the rest of the class. She could tell from the way the others moved that they were tired, too - primarily from the noticeable bags under their eyes, their lethargic movements, and the general exhaustion present on their faces.\n\nThe old man was now droning on about something unimportant, so Anna's mind drifted to other pressing matters. She hadn't really had time to think or take stock of everything that happened, and it was then that she realized just how much life had changed in these few short weeks.\n\nBefore she'd never have thought about hoarding, and now she'd gone hungry more than a few nights these past few weeks - just to have as many rations in the basement as she could. She thought about how she'd brought her children to the bomb shelter and prepared them as if an attack was imminent.\n\nAs the instructor lectured on, she just wished that his speech would end: that really, all this turmoil would end sooner rather than later so that a semblance of normality could return.

Undoubtedly, it can be difficult to see hope in the present situation.\n\nYet be assured, my comrades, that hope most certainly endures. Most of you still remember the beautiful days of our proud nation, before it was crudely dismembered by the Fascists and the German tyrant. You remember the times when we still were one people, united - a powerful, strong, and stable Union, before the democrats, tsarists, and collaborators betrayed us, driving their sharp knives straight through our back.\n\nLet me tell you, my friends, that the Union endures. Indeed, it is reborn, risen from the ashes! The Fascists and traitors thought they had destroyed us, but we, the West Russian Revolutionary Front, survived. Their attempts to crush us have failed.\n\nAs such, we appeal to you - indeed, to all Russians, near or far - for your support in retaking the Motherland. We are stronger together, and in the Union there is hope. For it is only when all of us are once again under the Union banner that we can avenge the heinous crimes committed against the Russian people.\n\nWe know that a long struggle lies ahead, but allow me to make you just one promise.

The children and grandparents alike hung onto every word, hearing the stories of the brave soldiers and generals of the Motherland. Maybe some stories here and there were exaggerated (and they all knew that) - but did it matter?\n\nBetween the bombings and the bandits, they needed some hope; some pride to cling to in their poverty.\n\nSo when they heard that the Soviet Union - or at least a remnant of it - had somehow survived, the family was in unanimous agreement. It didn't matter that their neighbors could be lying about the West Russian Revolutionary Front, or that news wasn't always reliable where they lived. It was the USSR: there was no argument to be had! They resolved to leave immediately - no matter the risks.\n\nIt was better than their lives now.\n\nDinner on the night they left was different. Already grandpa was going on about life in the old Union - the freedom, the strength, the pride of it all. The family indulged in dreams - not dreams of wealth, bounty or power - but simple ones, like a safe place to rest their heads. Even father began to wonder what it'd be like there.

That wasn't his real name, of course - he'd given a fake one to a WRRF agent he was supposed to meet fifteen minutes ago.\n\nThere was no knowing whether or not Agent Andrei was telling the truth, or even if he existed. In fact, many of his fellow comrades had warned him that it was a trap. But this was an opportunity unlike anything else. No longer would they just be sitting at their tables, discussing theory or sulking about the USSR's collapse. They'd actually be making a difference to Russia - making a different Russia, a better one.\n\nA large old truck rolled across the unmarked border, making a loud hissing sigh as it stopped. It certainly wasn't what he had expected. A masked man in a military uniform dropped from the truck, unsettling gravel as he walked towards Kliment. His suspicions were raised, but were abated when he saw the hammer and sickle on the masked man's shoulder.\n\n\"Comrade! Good to see you.\"\n\nThe agent motioned for the young man to come over. With a heave, the back of the truck opened - revealing something that was more than worth the young man's hours-long journey here. It was a crate of weapons. Not exactly a large crate, but more than useful enough for their purposes.\n\n\"This is for you and your friends,\" the man smiled knowingly. \"The revolution is coming, Kliment.

The young mayor was clearly a talented orator, his ideas already a problem. Give him and his fledgling movement time and space and their little mustard seed would grow into a gigantic tree. Pyotr had lived long enough not to underestimate seemingly small threats, and he could see one right about one kilometer away from him.\n\nHe felt his hand press around the cold metal of the trigger. The politician was still talking, and Pyotr almost felt sad that this fire would have to be snuffed out. Before his sympathy could become problematic, he pulled the trigger.\n\nInstantly, screaming and yelling. There was no more joy or laughter in the crowd - only the disordered wailing of those who had just lost their greatest hope. Racing down the stairs, he began reciting the reasons that he'd been given by his superiors over in his head: that a leaderless organization was like a headless chicken, and that the chaos from the event would help the Front in their mission.\n\nSeeing the crowd in full tumult validated his decision.

These reports were brimming with such effusive, almost self-congratulatory language that he'd almost wondered whether the military men needed more discipline.\n\nMany had wondered whether the Front was on its last legs. But if anyone had doubted their military prowess, there was no questioning it now. Yes, the last stragglers were still to be mopped up, but they had done it: they had unified the region once again.\n\nZhukov intended to review these reports more closely later, since the celebrations were about to begin. As he cleared the sheafs of paper from his table, however, he realized what had been left underneath: a map of the old Soviet Union. The Marshal peered closer, looking at it. It was an old, faded, yellowing map, the paper almost falling apart as he reached but even then, he couldn't help but feel nostalgic for the old Union.\n\nIn all the busyness surrounding this recent operation, it was deceptively easy to forget how much there was left to be done; how much they still needed to do before the Union was whole again.
