To build a path forward, the charismatic Trinidadian has called for a dialogue with every remaining Federational Prime Minister in his very own capital, the Port of Spain.\n\nAfter a few introductions and welcoming speeches, Williams looked prepared to read out his own speech. \"While Jamaica's exit from the Federation was unfortunate, we are not required to follow in their footsteps and dissolve the rest of the Federation. We are already a small country, but one I am proud of, and one I assure you can be led to prosperity. The Federational system has worked well for us in the past, but not well enough, so it seems.\"\n\nWilliams took a quick breather, curtly glancing at the ambassador seated across from him. \"So what I suggest is this; to rebuild the Federation as something new.\" He paused again. \"These West Indies were created as a strange hybrid of post World War Two nation building and foreign intervention, and definitely were not created to work for the West Indies. I suggest a total overhaul from a federational system to a unitary state, with the capital centered right here, in the Port of Spain.\"\n\nThe solution was a divisive one, at least in Robert's mind. Discussion had captured the room, mostly between the various prime ministers representing the various nations of the Caribbean. Most of them spoke of an infringement on their nation's rights, a fact of which Williams took notice of. \"As a last note, and I do not intend for this to serve as blackmail, but if my proposal is rejected, I cannot be sure if I will be able to maintain Trinidad as part of the Federation. Mr. Miner, perhaps you would like to weigh in on the issue?\"\n\nIf his comment would've added more discussion into the room, Robert would never know.

Their absence is already beginning to hit us financially, and if we allow the situation to continue, it is very possible living conditions in our own states could lower.\"\n\nAdams paused, and looked to Miner for his next statement. \"So, Mr. Ambassador, this is more of a proposal regarding you as anybody else in this room.

Maybe I can another way.\"\n\nBunny gave a somber nod, and Peter closed his eyes briefly. \"Not gonna be the same without you... but I understand,\" Peter said. Neither of them seemed surprised, even if saddened. Bob knew he would remember the early days fondly, but life was full of surprises, and sometimes, it was time to just move on. With handshakes and hugs, he received one last farewell from Bunny."

 wif_crisis.307.d:0 "Emerging from the multicultural traditions of Jamaica, musician Bob Marley has begun to take the world by storm with his new musical genre called \"Reggae,\" which Marley claims is based on a Spanish word for \"the king's music,\" though etymologists and musicians question this.

 WIN_unnatural_union: "An Unnatural Union"
 WIN_unnatural_union_desc: "Before 1945, there was no such thing as the West Indies Federation. What there was was a hodge-podge of colonial holdings, divided between once great European powers. Those great powers today are shadows of their former selves, and we now find our disparate islands tied together in a polity never meant to exist, despite cultural, linguistic, and economic differences.\n\nThe West Indies Federation was conceived as little more than a customs union with a weak parliament. Two decades later, the government struggles to manage even that, as individual islands use legal grey areas and ambiguity to manage their own affairs, often coming into conflict with one another. Until something is done about the weakness of the Federation, these problems show no signs of going away."
 WIN_dreams_of_unity: "Dreams of Unity"
 WIN_dreams_of_unity_desc: "Before 1945, there was no such thing as the West Indies Federation. What there was was a hodge-podge of colonial holdings, divided between once great European powers. Those great powers today are shadows of their former selves, and we now find our disparate islands tied together in a polity never meant to exist - but things have begun to look up in the Caribbean, despite our internal divisions.\n\nThe so-called Manley Constitution, recently ratified, clearly and firmly determines the difference in responsibilities between island and federation. In addition, the constitution will enshrine protections for local cultures, quelling the fears of assimilation that have caused so much mistrust. With this new clarity, it seems like the West Indies Federation is finally coming into its own."
 WIN_more_perfect_union: "A More Perfect Union"
 WIN_more_perfect_union_desc: "Many words have been used to describe the West Indies Federation in years past. Divided, dysfunctional, unworkable, doomed - all with valid reasons as to why they were such common descriptors. In recent days, though, a new verb has become more and more common - successful.\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean have stared down their most politically divided hours in decades, fanned by foreign powers using the Federation as a mere pawn in a greater game, and have emerged stronger from them. The Manley Constitution has taken effect across the islands, finally setting clear limits on what individual members can and cannot do, ending the endless bickering while also protecting the diverse cultures of each island. There is little talk of independence referendums, or unilateral exits - the Federation is stronger than it has ever been, and is ready to face the vast world of the Cold War as a single, united front."
 WIN_trinidad_dominance: "Trinidadian Dominance"
 WIN_trinidad_dominance_desc: "The West Indies Federation has lived through its greatest catastrophe, but it emerges radically different from the equally-balanced, if weak, Federation of before. Today, much of the Federation's power, political and economic, runs solely through the last remaining powerhouse of Trinidad, directed by its influential leader Eric Williams.\n\nJamaica's independence was initially thought to be a death blow to the powerless entity, now deprived of its strongest member, but Williams saw opportunity where others saw destruction. Swooping into an emergency session of Parliament, his proposal of a more unitary model centered around Trinidad was soon accepted, and the Federation underwent a radical change. Perhaps it was a vote borne of desperation, or perhaps it was to keep the Federation's last major island on board. Whatever the reason, Port of Spain now sees politicians from all over flock to it, and Trinidad finds itself at the head of a nation that has survived the worst-case scenario, ready to challenge an uncertain future."
 WIN_fading_union: "The Union Fades"
 WIN_fading_union_desc: "The West Indies Federation is dying, and it's unclear that anything can bring it back from the brink.\n\nJamaica was the first to leave, the economic powerhouse determining that independence was preferable to carrying the rest of the Caribbean islands on its back. Then, Trinidad's efforts to reform the Federation around itself fell through, and it too pulled out. Now, all that remains are the smallest ten territories, rudderless and bickering with one another over what to do next, with nationalists in each declaring that the Federation would be better off dead than dragging its final members down with it.\n\nAdrift at sea, there remains faint, unlikely hope that the Federation will escape dissolution. If it does, it has been irrevocably weakened, dependent on American money and politically pathetic even within its own borders. There will be no great Caribbean nation moving forwards together anytime soon, but perhaps something can be salvaged from this disaster."
 WIN_regional_nationalism: "Regional Nationalism"
 WIN_regional_nationalism_desc: "At first, when the shackles of European colonialism were broken and the Caribbean Islands finally breathed freely, those who lived on these tropical lands rejoiced in celebration of their newfound freedom. Proudly, they supported the newborn Federation, hailing it as the best tool to keep any foreign power, European or otherwise, from dominating their affairs again.\n\nIt's been some years since the Federation's founding, however, and disillusionment with the once-illustrious idea has grown to higher levels than ever. Main grievances from regional nationalists tend to center around their island's financial commitments to its neighbors, as well as the overbearing shadow of the United States looming over every decision the Federation makes. Under these conditions, the nationalists say, the Federation is no better than the colonial empires it was forged from - and, with their numbers only swelling with each passing dysfunctional day, the premise of secession no longer seems as ridiculous as it once did."
 WIN_minority_struggle: "Minority Rights Struggle"
 WIN_minority_struggle_desc: "The West Indies Federation is a union of many peoples; Afro-West Indians, East Indians, white European settlers, Chinese and Arab immigrants, and native Caribs, with a smorgasbord of languages and religions across the islands. As the years have gone on, tensions between these different groups have bubbled ominously under the surface, punctured occasionally by the Civil Rights struggles in America and the fighting in Africa and Asia. It seems, however, that these tensions have risen into a slow, rapidly accelerating boil.\n\nSkirmishes break out regularly between Jamaican police and Rastafaris, choking Kingston streets in tear gas and smoke. Black Trinidadians march for representation, facing off against government forces, with talk of a major strike looming. European settlers withdraw deeper into their communities, fearfully arming themselves in case the worst comes to pass. Until an acceptable solution is reached, the issue of minority rights will continue to haunt our nation."
 WIN_uncle_sams_aid: "Propped up by Uncle Sam"
 WIN_uncle_sams_aid_desc: "The West Indies Federation, by all accounts, shouldn't have survived. Its leading islands pulled out amid growing discontent, leaving the remaining members floundering in the Atlantic. With no clear leader, no direction, and no money, that should have been the end of the West Indies experiment, and the Caribbean would have gone its separate ways.\n\nHowever, the world of the Cold War works in mysterious ways. In a final, desperate attempt to save what remained, a cry for help was thrown to the same Americans that were to blamed for the Federation's existence. The Yankees responded swiftly, sweeping in with pockets flush of cash and dollar signs in their eyes. In a flash, it was like they'd always been there - bases reinforced and leases renewed, mineral rights hurriedly signed over, and the government promised whatever financial resources it needed. The nationalists - indeed, many citizens - cry out in protest, seeing no difference between the Americans and their colonial masters from before, but the Federation has little choice.\n\nThe unnatural union will survive on the American lifeline, or they will fall to pieces."
 JAM_political_violence: "Political Violence"
 JAM_political_violence_desc: "There are two parties in Jamaica that truly matter. One one side is the social-democratic People's National Party; on the other is the conservative Jamaica Labour Party. These two factions, longtime rivals, have engaged in many political battles before, but another facet of Jamaican politics is left off official records - not back-room deals, but back-alley shootings, which have only become more common in the politically tense times we live in.\n\nEach day, youth gangs take to the streets clad in the colors of their favored party, ready to agitate their rivals, packing lead pipes, knives, and pistols to use. Jamaican side streets are the scenes of brawls, flurries of violence that break apart with the crack of guns and the shouts of police. The murder rate has skyrocketed, and the violence shows no sign of abating, despite the efforts of both parties to disavow their violent supporters. It seems only calmer times will fix this bloody rupture - or, at least, return it to its normal rate."
 JAM_miracle: "Miracle on the Hope River"
 JAM_miracle_desc: "While the world has spiraled further and further in chaos and conflict, these interesting times seem to have spared Jamaica from its worst effects. Indeed, a major reason of our secession from the Federation goes back to the sudden success of our economy - an economy that is now for Jamaica's benefit, and Jamaica alone.\n\nNever before have the people enjoyed such wealth as they do now, as trade rolls in from the United States and the other Caribbean nations and tourists flock to our golden beaches and clear blue skies. The wealth of our island, both in appearance and in resources, spurs our economic growth to greater and greater heights. As the money rolls in, we can raise a glass to prosperity, and relax secure in the knowledge that Jamaica has never been more free or wealthy than it is today."
 JAM_rastafarian_repression: "Rastafarian Repression"
 JAM_rastafarian_repression_desc: "Jamaican culture is inexorably tied to the Rastafarians. Born in the impoverished Black communities of the early 20th century, this unique religion has been the cause of interest for decades, with their worship of Emperor Haile Selassie as the messiah, smoking of \"ganja\", and distinctive dialect. These worshippers used to be little more than a curious subculture, keeping to themselves and meeting peacefully to spread their beliefs - but the Rastafari have grown far beyond their humble roots.\n\nThe relationship between the religion and the government has always been strained, with the believers seeing non-believers as instruments of the decadent Babylon and non-believers seeing believers as delusional, but recent events have only amplified that tense relationship. Many believed that the exiled Selassie, being the Messiah, would never die, and his death has splintered parts of the Rastafari into vengeful, aggressive sects with differing explanations on what happened - from postulating that he was only an incarnation of Jah to claiming that Selassie faked his death and now orchestrates massive anti-Italian resistance. These offshoots regularly clash with the overworked police, who increasingly crack down on all Rastafarians, regardless of their personal actions. This spiral only worsens with every incident, and neither side has any trust or love lost for the other.\n\nIf a solution is not found, tensions could boil over in a deadly way."
 JAM_jamaica_first: "No Federation, No Masters"
 JAM_jamaica_first_desc: "First, it was the Spanish. They arrived hundreds of years ago in their massive warships, bringing deadly disease, cannons, and slaves. Taino and escaped slaves held out in the hills, escaping and resisting their clutches - the first native Jamaican identity emerging from their fight.\n\nThen it was the British, who replaced the Spanish in name but no less in cruelty. Plantations sprung up, along with thousands upon thousands of settlers and slaves, expanding the island massively in population. Still, the Jamaican identity held out in the overlooked nooks and crannies, growing in the places the British did not go.\n\nTime passed. The British loosened their grip, ended slavery on the island, passed more reforms - and then, like a storm, they were swept away in the chaos of the Second World War, and the Americans swooped in to replace them. Jamaica was roped into an ungainly, dysfunctional Federation, designed to take the wealth from Jamaicans and bundle it away. Once again, Jamaica rejected this imperialist dream, and broke free of its repression in spectacular fashion.\n\nNow, Jamaica is free. There are no more empires left to beat back. After centuries of struggle, the Rock will chart its own course and plan its own destiny.\n\nIs there anything sweeter than the taste of freedom?"
 TRI_undersea_riches: "Undersea Riches"
 TRI_undersea_riches_desc: "Though our hasty exit from the West Indies Federation was a cause for alarm to many citizens, Trinidad is in a uniquely good position to ride out the storm of instability such a rapid change has caused. Despite the sudden shortfall in trade both in and out of the country, our economy remains stable thanks to one crucial resource - oil, the lifeblood of the modern world, which lies in great quantities below Trinidadian waters.\n\nOil is our safety net, the force that keeps our economy in good condition despite the hardest conditions one can throw at it. As long as the oil flows, the money will flow with it, and Trinidad will remain prosperous."
 TRI_disunited_front: "A Disunited Front"
 TRI_disunited_front_desc: "Eric Williams is out, to the shock of millions around the Caribbean, his once-illustrious legacy tossed into the mud by the will of a people furious with his inaction. In his place rises a large coalition of anti-Williams leftists and conservatives alike, united by their burning will to see Williams out and change come to Trinidad.\n\nThe problem, of course, is deciding what this change actually will be.\n\nThe unions, whose strike ground the economy to a halt, demand further protections and benefits for them and their workers. The leaders of the Army, whose mutiny struck the final blow and toppled the Williams regime, demand that power be put into apolitical hands - their hands - as loudly as their soldiers cry for change. The Black Power movement, whose protests started this chain of events, demand that their cries for social change are accepted and implemented.\n\nIn the middle of this whirlpool, it falls to the interim Daaga government to chart an impossible course through the chaos. The future path of Trinidad hinges on their success or failure."
 TRI_pnm_dominance: "PNM Dominance"
 TRI_pnm_dominance_desc: "Trinidad is a democracy, undeniably, but it's hard to tell if one looks at the recent electoral results. The PNM dominates the political scene in every facet and position, disarming its opposition with an almost surgical precision. Led by the immensely popular Eric Williams, President and so-called \"Father of the Nation\", the PNM has enjoyed consistent popularity since the formation of the WIF, and has no challengers to truly oppose it.\n\nOf course, nothing lasts forever, and the nationalist, left-wing slant of the PNM has its fair share of opponents, as does Eric Williams himself. However, until these opponents are able to organize themselves - or until they're able to coax a majority of the people to their side - Eric Williams and the PNM look set to dominate the near future of Trinidad."
