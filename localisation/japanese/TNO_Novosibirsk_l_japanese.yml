 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_POKRYSHKIN_DESC: "第二次世界大戦の伝説的なエースパイロットであり、ソビエト連邦の英雄であったアレクサンドル・イヴァーノヴィチ・ポクルィシュキンは、終戦後、故郷のノヴォシビルスクに戻ることになる。比較的平和な生活を望んでいた彼は、運命が彼をどこに導くのかをほとんど知らなかった。\n\nポクルィシュキンは、中央シベリア共和国の統治に満足していたし、最終的には政府に昇り詰めた。共和国の下でノヴォシビルスク市を管理することは比較的簡単なことだった。シベリア戦争が起こるまでは。やがて彼は、東のヤゴーダの強大な最高ソビエトに対抗するために、街全体を戦争状態にしなければならなくなった。配給制が導入され、徴兵制が激化し、ノヴォシビルスクの若者たちはシベリアの戦場で命を落とすことになった。ある時点で、ポクルィシュキンは限界に達した。バルナウル市長のヴァシーリー・シュクシンとの裏取引を経て、計画は動き出した。\n\n二人とその部下がノヴォシビルスクを迅速に掌握し、新政府を組織した。ロシアの混乱の中で、いかなる影響力からも解放され、真の主権者となる政府を。今やバルナウルとの不穏な同盟関係の中で統治しているポクルィシュキンは、国家の安定性を確保する必要がある。多くの人口、工業、機能的農業を誇るノヴォシビルスクだが、内外の問題を抱えており、その解決はポクルィシュキンの手に委ねられている。"

 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_DESC: "Born in 1929 in Altai Krai, Vasily Makarovich Shukshin was an aspiring author prior to his dabbling in politics and his election as mayor of Barnaul. Shukshin has trekked a long road so far, one which seems endless: a prior ally of Pokryshkin when the Federation had just seceded from the Central Siberian Republic, Vasily quickly came to head with his former ally and his corporate associates, their creeping corruption clashing with Shukshin's ideals of democracy and federalism, ideals keeping his head afloat as he arranged backroom deals and negotiations necessary for his candidacy as President of the Federation to stand a chance.\n\nNow newly elected and having wrestled control away of the country from the Siloviks, Vasily isn't in a position to sit back and relax: though the Siloviks aren't in control anymore, the President has to deal with the still very present corporations and the damages their corruption has caused and is still causing to the Republic.\n\nIf he wants to see this budding democracy bloom in the desert that is Russia, he will have to face troubles caused undoubtedly by corporations during his tenure as President."

 NOV_encourage_infighting_among_opposition: "野党の内紛を助長"
 NOV_encourage_infighting_among_opposition_desc: "ポクルィシュキンに反対する野党の統一性が非常に小さいという事実は、ほぼ独占的に我々の利益となる。シュクシンの運動に関わる無数の派閥のいくつかに組織内での不満を持たせる事が出来れば、野党は我々に対して効果的に運動を行うことができなくなる。混乱すればするほど良く、野党の団結を完全に打ち砕くことができるかもしれない。"
 NOV_hold_military_parade: "軍事パレードを行う"
 NOV_hold_military_parade_desc: "弱った政治運動を立て直す最良の方法は、国民の間にナショナリズムの感情をかき立てることである。軍隊の壮大な行進は、ポクルィシュキンが国を強くしたこと、そして彼が無数の敵から国民を守ることができる唯一の人物であることを有権者に思い出させるだろう。政治色の強い行進をして軍に政治の手綱を握らせないと有権者を納得させられれば、野党を抑えられるかもしれない。"
 NOV_utilize_the_sb: "保安当局を利用"
 NOV_utilize_the_sb_desc: "競争性の強い選挙を実施する事は、野党に対して立派に振る舞うという政府の決意を国民に示している。しかし密室内でこの決意を喜んで捨てることができる。シュクシンの運動に対して治安当局を使用することは正しくないかもしれないが、野党の運動を妨げるための信じられないほど効果的な方法かもしれない。シュクシンのスキャンダルを掘り起こし（あるいは捏造し）、それを報道機関に公開することは、有権者をシュクシンに反発させる強力な方法となるだろう。"
 NOV_promote_national_unity: "国民の結束を宣伝"
 NOV_promote_national_unity_desc: "選挙に勝つためにはメッセージを送る必要がある。国民を結束させるメッセージだ。プロパガンダは、我々の統治、団結、そして国家に望まれる全ての資質の肯定的な側面を強調して作られなければならない。ポスターは全ての建物の全ての壁に貼られ、ラジオ放送は全てのラジオ局で全ての周波数で行われるだろう。派閥主義とイデオロギーが国民を分断してはならないので、国民は祖国のためにその慈悲深い政府の下で団結しなければならない。"

 NOV_meet_with_democratic_activists_desc: "シュクシンの選挙運動を成功させるならば、野党が団結する必要がある。ポクルィシュキンはすでに盟友間の思想の違いを利用している可能性が高いので、我々は迅速に行動しなければならない。シュクシンは民主主義への支持者との会議を数多く開催し、結束と共闘を求める。我々が本当に祖国を民主主義国家にしたいのならば、最後のチャンスを滅してはならない。"
 NOV_denounce_corruption: "汚職を糾弾"
 NOV_denounce_corruption_desc: "最終的な今回の選挙の目標は、国を長い間公正さから遠ざけてきた体制を覆すことである。国家は今まで抑圧、貪欲、暴力、汚職を助長していた。我々は、民主主義、自由、そしてこの国を代表するために形成した真の価値の名の下に、人々が腐敗を目撃し、それに立ち向かうために悪を曝け出す必要がある。シロヴィキの本性、つまり腐敗した抑圧者を非難しよう。"
 NOV_appeal_to_the_common_people: "民衆へのアピール"
 NOV_appeal_to_the_common_people_desc: "我々の運動は民衆のためのものであり、浮世離れの腐敗したシロヴィキのためでは無い。一般的なロシア人に、我々は改革、自由、そして自主決定といった与えなければならない物を与える。そして我々は、民衆の生活をより良くするためにできる限りの政策を約束するだろう。しかし、さらに重要な事は、これをシロヴィキが過去数年間に一般的なロシア人に与えた物、つまり停滞、抑圧、腐敗と対比する事だ。"
 NOV_talk_to_sympathetic_officers: "共感する士官との対話"
 NOV_talk_to_sympathetic_officers_desc: "我々が今住んでいるこの国はかつては単なる軍閥国家だったが、政治家だけでなく、兵士や獅子心を持った指揮官らによって建設された。従って士官達は深く尊敬されており、多くは非政治的だが政治に深く興味を持っている者は数多くいる。彼らの中にも国家をシロヴィキの束縛から解放するために我々の運動に共感する者がいるはずである。我々は彼らにアプローチをかけ、彼らが我々につくことを確かめ、彼らの十分な力を利用することを確認する必要がある。"

 NOV_the_security_question: "治安問題"
 NOV_the_security_question_desc: "政府と政治的扇動者との間の緊張が反抗的な社会主義者によって組織されたと疑われるテロ攻撃に繋がったため、法執行は確実に困難になってきている。\n\nこれらの卑劣な活動は国内を大きく不安定にするため、継続させる事は許されない。テロリストが我々の未来にもたらす脅威と戦うため、治安を改善する必要があるだろう。\n\n国は、法と秩序を維持するためにこれらの改革を行う必要がある。"

 NOV_expand_the_security_agencies_desc: "最近の主要都市におけるナロードニキによるテロ活動の増加により、ポクルィシュキン大統領は、Sluzhba Bezopasnosti（SB）の権限を拡大する大統領令に署名した。SBは、ノヴォシビルスクとバルナウルの主要な連邦治安機関として設立以来社会主義者やアナキストの扇動から連邦の安全を保ってきた。\n\nこれらの新しい権限により、SBは地方政府や連邦政府の介入無しに社会主義テロリストに対して法に触れず行動できるはずだ。ナロードニキが混乱を引き起こさないようになるべく早く仕事を終わらせなければならず、SBはそれに対する正当で唯一のものである。"

 NOV_meet_with_shukshin_desc: "連邦大統領のアレクサンドル・ポクルィシュキンにはバルナウル市長との会談の予定がある。バルナウルの人々の生活と連邦全体の将来の強さの鍵となる問題について話し合う必要があるからだ。\n\nバルナウルは農業が盛んであり、連邦中の過密都市では食料が切実に必要とされている。両者の間で合意がなされなければならない。さもなければ、彼らの展望は暗いものになるだろう。\n\n我々は、ポクルィシュキンが双方の市民の改善のために市長との有益な合意を見出す事を期待しなければならない。"

 NOV_a_bountiful_relationship_desc: "バルナウルとノヴォシビルスクの将来の関係について、ポクルィシュキン大統領とヴァシーリー・シュクシン市長との間で結論が出されようとしている。シュクシンはポクルィシュキンの権威下で暮らす事の利益を知り、そのような重要な助けに対価を支払う必要性も認識するだろう。\n\nシュクシンは我々の要求に耳を傾ける必要があるのだ。そしてバルナウルの治安のために彼は自らの農地を提供するだろう。バルナウルの肥沃な農地は、市長の下に住む人々だけでなく、連邦の全人口を改善するために使用される事になる。\n\n彼は我々の利益に協力しなければならない事を知るだろう。"
 NOV_tighten_control: "確固たる支配"
 NOV_tighten_control_desc: "連邦内で安定性を高める必要がある。いかなる形の反対派に対しても、暴力的な抵抗に備えて危険な賭けはできない。暴力の発生を許すことはできず、我々は民衆が住む領土内において平和を守る義務がある。そして民衆も確かにこれを理解している。政府はより強力な権威に代わる危険な可能性を認識しているので、国家に対する統制を強化する必要がある。\n\nこのためには政府は国家の支配を強化する事を認められなければならない。民衆は連邦にとって何が良く、何が良くないかを知っており、そして誰もがより安全である事を確かめるだろう。"
 NOV_the_soldiers_soviet: "シロヴィキ国家"
 NOV_the_soldiers_soviet_desc: "中央シベリア地域の近隣諸国とは対照的に、ノヴォシビルスクとアルタイの連邦はシロヴィキ、つまり政治が退役又は現役の軍人の指導下にある国家である。その結果、伝統的な政党政治への参加を望んでいる多くの民間官僚は、公職に立候補することを禁じられており、シロヴィキの非軍事部門が要求する命令順守はしばしば過剰かもしれない。\n\nだがこれらは全て意図的な物である。ロシアは、ソビエト連邦、中央シベリア共和国、そしてロシア人の政治思想を支配しようとする巨大で残忍なイデオロギーの攻撃を乗り越えてきた。道行く人々はよく「くそったれのシロヴィキ」と言うが、彼らはイデオロギー的思想の危険から自らを守る要塞に気づいていないのである。"
 NOV_the_champions_of_industry: "産業の覇者"
 NOV_the_champions_of_industry_desc: "ノヴォシビルスク・アルタイ連邦を、ケメロヴォの神秘主義的な王、カンスクの黒衛軍、トムスクの共和国などと区別する1つの特徴は、市民の日常生活を支配する企業の存在である。最も支配的な3つは、フェニクス、シビル、チタンであり、それぞれが経済の様々な部門を専門としている。それら全ての中で最も積極的に親シロヴィキ的であるフェニクスは、軍事装備のメーカーだ。バルナウルのシュクシン市長と曖昧に連携しているシビルは、我々の農機具と金融専門家の主要な出処である。最後の一つは、ノヴォシビルスク社会の主要な先駆者でありテクノクラートでもあるタイタンである。\n\n時が来れば、ポクルィシュキン大統領は彼への忠誠心をどこから掴むかを決定しなければならないだろう。もしかすると、将来的には彼は代わりに人民を選ぶかもしれない。太陽の沈む街では、全てが決定可能だ。"
 NOV_the_rising_phoenix: "昇りゆくフェニクス"
 NOV_the_rising_phoenix_desc: "ポクルィシュキン大統領とフェニクスコーポレーションの間には長い歴史がある。国家は、隣国に対する防衛のための軍事装備の供給を後者に依存しており、前者はフェニクスの労働慣行を保護するための政治的影響力を彼らに提供している（もしかすると欠如しているかもしれないが）。フェニクスは中央シベリア共和国の崩壊後に後のシロヴィキによって設立され、連邦全体、特に大統領府と緊密な関係を築いてきた。彼らは確かに信頼できるパートナーであり、外部の重大な脅威から連邦を守るための献身的な姿勢を堅持している。\n\n誰が彼らを認めないと言うのか？シビルは農業生産と経済成長の増加をもたらすかもしれないが、彼らはノヴォシビルスクの富を全ての略奪者から守ることはできないだろう。過激主義に対する政治的領域における防衛のため、国家は日常生活においてもそれと戦うための兵器を必要としている。共和国が呼びかけた時、フェニクスはそれに答えなければならない。"
 NOV_the_siberian_bear: "シベリアの熊"
 NOV_the_siberian_bear_desc: "シビルコーポレーションは、設立に関して少し奇妙な歴史を持っている。国民の間のイメージでは、ノヴォシビルスクのシロヴィキが支配する政治体制の中で成功を収めた珍しい民間政治家の1人であるバルナウル市長のヴァシーリー・シュクシンに関連している。中央シベリア共和国の崩壊後に誕生した、土地を持つブルジョアジーによって設立された彼らは、農機具や農産物の生産、そしてノヴォシビルスクの多くの人々が労働者階級の貧困からの脱出を助けてきた金融機関を運営を行っている。\n\n彼らの問題は政治と経済の両方にある。フェニクスとは創設以来連邦との取引関係があり、シビルとの契約に署名する事はリスクを伴う。しかし、ロシアは永遠の戦争状態にはならず、軍事装備は貧困の蔓延に立ち向かうのには役立たない。大統領が連邦内の過激派の思想を鎮めたいのであれば、最善の対抗策は経済的繁栄かもしれない。"
 NOV_glory_to_the_pioneers: "先駆者への栄光"
 NOV_glory_to_the_pioneers_desc: "進歩はチタンコーポレーションを表す唯一の言葉である。ありふれた問題に技術的解決策を提供する事を専門とし、トムスクのモダニスト達と直接競い、中央シベリア科学の最前線となった。彼らの出自が同じである事を考えれば、彼らがそれほどまでに成功しているのも不思議ではないだろう。しかし、イデオロギー的なモダニストとは異なり、チタンコーポレーションの科学者、テクノクラート、投資家は、普遍的な科学への貢献についてあまり気にしていないが、彼らは自由市場内にいる科学組織であるため、モダニスト達と競争しなければならない。悲しい事に、この無関心は彼らの労働慣行にまで及び、一般的な社員には長時間の過酷な労働が要求されている。\n\n連邦は、タイタンに味方する事を選択した場合、人民の怒りを招くだろう。しかし、我々全員が進歩の代償を払う特権はないのだ。"
 NOV_overtures_to_the_people: "人民序曲"
 NOV_overtures_to_the_people_desc: "連邦の人民は落ち着きが無い。彼らは軍事政権と企業の力を心配と不安の眼で見ている。人民を宥めるため、我々は僅かに支配を緩めるべきである。これは、我々が彼らに自由な統治を提供するという事では無いが、それに軽く触れる事は恐らくより賢い方法である。\n\n第一に、報道機関への制限を緩和する必要がある。より自由な報道を許可する事は、人民に我々の統治の利点を見る手段を与えるだろう。もちろんだが、コンテンツの適切な規制は引き続き適用される。結局の所、連邦への誹謗中傷を許可する事は愚かである。\n\n第二に、労働組合に少し大きな自治権を与える必要がある。労働者に、国が後援する組合に彼らが不満を公表する事を許可すれば、我々は彼らをより良く包み込めるようになる。当たり前だが、これらの組合はあまり大きな力は持たないため最終的には政府に応えるようになるだろう。\n\n最後に、中産階級に対する抑圧の全面的な緩和が無ければならない。それでも制限する必要はあるが、制限を緩和する事によって彼らからより良い支持が得られるため、労働者階級をより適切に管理できるようになるだろう。"
 NOV_always_an_even_trade: "恒常的で均衡な取引"
 NOV_always_an_even_trade_desc: "連邦は、他の多くの政体と同様に、多くの人々の利益に基づいて構成された集合体である。階級、企業、労働組合、そして政府は、彼らの力が集結し妥協する事を可能にする体制内において覇権を争っている。そのために連邦の政治体制は常にゼロサムゲームになってしまっている。どこかで動いた得点を元に戻すことはできない。厳しい制度であるが、政治は最初から無慈悲で残酷なものだった。\n\nそのため、大統領の裁定は多くの点で重要であるが、連邦の将来がどうなるかを予測することはできない。大統領がしなければならないのは、もし彼らが何かをしたとしても彼の行いの結果と共に生きる事だ。ノヴォシビルスクとアルタイは未来を見つめ、市民の心には慎重な楽観主義が高まっている。いつの日か、ブハーリンがシベリアの中心として建設した物は、新ロシアにおける政治体制の心臓となるだろう。"
 NOV_veterans_of_the_siberian_war: "シベリア戦争の熟練兵"
 NOV_veterans_of_the_siberian_war_desc: "ノヴォシビルスクが地域の敵に対して持つ最大のアドバンテージの1つは、比較的大規模で経験豊富な陸軍である。兵士達はシベリア戦争の最前線で歯を食いしばり、その後、縮小したトムスクの共和国からの離脱が始まった。我々の過去の戦闘を研究し、成功と失敗を調べることにより、我々は自らの軍の効力を向上させる事ができる。\n\n隣国の軍隊に規律が欠けており、装備が不十分なままであるため、我が軍の経験値は将来の紛争で大きな優勢をもたらす可能性があるだろう。"
 NOV_our_own_shock_troops: "我ら自身の突撃部隊"
 NOV_our_own_shock_troops_desc: "我々の将軍は、敵の軍を穿ち抜け、迅速かつ効果的に攻撃する部隊の能力を向上させるよう設計された特別な訓練に投資することにより、軍の規模を拡大する計画を考案した。これらの兵士は敵の最前線を突破するのに精通し、将来の戦争が我々の軍と市民に与える被害の量を制限するだろう。\n\nさらに、これらのエリート部隊の配備は確実に中央シベリア地域の残りの部分で軍事力を高め続け、我々に対する侵略を計画する十分愚かな軍閥や国家を食い止めるだろう。"
 NOV_the_skies_are_ours: "空は我らの物"
 NOV_the_skies_are_ours_desc: "空軍は中央シベリア、または確かにロシアの他の地域のどの軍においても珍しい資産だが、ノヴォシビルスクは幸運にも中央シベリア共和国空軍の大部分と、現在私たちの政府を構成している多くの空軍将校を継承する事ができた。新政権を樹立した将校の中には、「シベリアの鷹」そのものであるポクルィシュキン大統領も含まれている。\n\n既存のインフラと空軍基地の改善、及び空軍向けの新技術の開発は、これらの提案を推進することを計画する大臣の間で支持されるアイデアを証明した。中央シベリアの空は我々が支配し続けるだろう。"
 NOV_mechanized_infantry: "機械化歩兵"
 NOV_mechanized_infantry_desc: "有能でまともな規模の産業を維持しているロシアの数少ない国の1つとして、我々はそれを有効活用し、陸軍の機械化を拡大する必要がある。他の国は比較的非装甲のままであるため、連邦の軍は大きな技術的優位性を獲得するはずだ。\n\n機動性の向上は、我が軍が作った突破口を利用するのにも役立ち、それは軍を誰も止められない力にするだろう。"
 NOV_the_fruits_of_the_siberian_plan: "シベリア計画の果実"
 NOV_the_fruits_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "ノヴォシビルスクは、ブハーリンのシベリア計画から最も恩恵を受けた場所の1つだった。その時以来、我々の産業はその生産量を大幅に増加させた。連邦経済は未だ発展しており、新たな工場が開業し続け、建設技術の進歩と国全体のインフラの拡充が行われている。\n\nこれら全ての要因により産業効率は大幅に向上し、軍用装備をより大量に生産できるようになり、国家の統一に更に一歩近づいた。"
 NOV_the_virgin_lands_campaign: "処女地キャンペーン"
 NOV_the_virgin_lands_campaign_desc: "我々の農業生産に課せられた大量の負荷を軽減するのを助けるため、政府から新しい計画が考案された。簡単に言えば、人口が増大しているにもかかわらず、穀物生産は増えていないため、この問題はノヴォシビルスクにおいて急速に永続的で最大の危機になりつつあるという事である。\n\n幸いな事に、政府が考案した計画によって、まだ耕作されていない土地に難民を再定住させることで食糧不足と不均衡な人口の両方に対処できる。最終的に、これは農業生産と難民の生活の両方を改善し始めるだろう。"
 NOV_crack_down_on_the_strikes: "ストライキの取り締まり"
 NOV_crack_down_on_the_strikes_desc: "労働者は直接行動に訴え始めた。工場は全ての都市で休眠状態にあり、もぬけの殻になっている。そのため生産のペースは減速した。労働者は「不公平」な状態のために高慢になっているとしか思えないが、譲歩することはできない。譲歩すれば彼らはすぐに大金を要求するだろう。我らが政府は、これらのストライキを鎮圧し、労働者階級を仕事に戻すことを決定した。\n\n取り締まりは労働者との緊張をエスカレートさせるが、数人の不満を持った工場労働者が仕事に戻される事は、絶え間ない行き詰まりや経済的非効率よりも遥かに好ましい結果である。"
 NOV_ramp_up_arms_production: "兵器の増産"
 NOV_ramp_up_arms_production_desc: "脅迫や武力によって、中央シベリア地域を完全に支配し、残りの土地を連邦に組み込むのに十分な大きさにまで拡大し続けるには、軍はより多くの武器を必要とするだろう。全ての兵器の生産割当の増加は、軍拡を支援するために政府によって命令されることになっている。\n\n政府の最近の行動の多くは労働者を動揺させており、これが状況を改善する可能性は低い。そして緊張が続くならば、重大な結果が将来の連邦に直面するだろう。"
 NOV_the_beating_heart_of_siberia: "シベリアの鼓動"
 NOV_the_beating_heart_of_siberia_desc: "ノヴォシビルスクは繁栄し、通りは人で溢れ、工場は労働者でいっぱいになり、目立つ犯罪は事実上起こっていない。街はとても豊かなので、残存する数人の物乞いでさえ食料を与えられ、ちゃんと服を着ているように見える。そのような光景は、東の無政府国家との西の破壊的国家とは全く対照的である。\n\n我々の決断はこれまで予想していたよりもうまくいったようであり、彼らの成功に疑いがあったわけではない。農業、産業、更には我々の安定性の発展により、ノヴォシビルスクはいくらかの自由の代償にも関わらず、シベリア全体で最も魅力的な都市になった。"
 NOV_our_destiny_made_manifest: "天命が生んだ野望"
 NOV_our_destiny_made_manifest_desc: "ノヴォシビルスクは、過去数か月間、麻薬、犯罪、社会主義扇動者などの内部問題と戦ってきたが、これらの問題は解決され、我々の立場は強化された。そして国内を見る代わりに、今の国境から外を眺める時が来た。将軍達は、兵士が向かう事になる戦いに備え、戦争計画を作成し始めるようすでに命じられており、連邦軍の指揮下での戦闘によって中央シベリアの征服はほぼ保障されている。\n\n鷹の翼はもはや縛られておらず、連邦が飛ぶ時が来たのだ。"
 NOV_spring_rasputitsa: "春の泥濘期"
 NOV_spring_rasputitsa_desc: "冬の雪は春に融け、中央シベリアの多くの森や野原で緑が蘇るにつれ、軍隊も蘇る。冬の間は利用不可と見なされた地域も春には完全にアクセス可能となった。かつては人や自動車の流れとは関係のなかった道路は、兵士や車両の動きによって渋滞している。\n\n緊張が高まり、軍隊が動員されるにともなって戦争が間近に迫っている事は明らかとなる。もし我々が今後の戦いで勝利を収めようとするならば、過去の栄光に甘んじる事などできない。"
 NOV_encourage_forward_thinking: "攻撃的思考を奨励"
 NOV_encourage_forward_thinking_desc: "連邦が今後の戦争において勝利を収めるには、国民が最終的な勝利への信頼と願望を持っている事を確かめるだけでなく、彼らが国家を前進させるための労働を保証する必要がある。\n\nそのために我々は、彼らがそのためだけに働くのであれば、将来の可能性、ロシアの可能性について適切に教育するよう努めるだろう。予想される市民参加と労働倫理の拡大は、経済的及びその他の目的で我々の目標を支持せざるを得ないために、追求する必要がある。"
 NOV_a_rural_urban_base: "農村-都市間基盤"
 NOV_a_rural_urban_base_desc: "現在も将来も、我々が直面する課題に対して安定し、強く、団結し続けるためには国民が真のコミュニティを感じられるようにする必要がある。現在連邦内では、農村と工業化された都市中心部との間で経験と見解により認められた分裂があり、これを是正する必要がある。\n\n双方のコミュニティに共有された経験に訴える事に特に焦点を当てた教育運動が委託される。そうする事により、我々は互いのメンバーと話をし、互いの経験を彼らに示し、そして将来の苦難のために国の下で彼ら全員を団結させる事を確実にするだろう。"

 NOV_the_patriots_federation_desc: "国家を支持する必要性を国民に納得させるための我々の努力は続いている。ロシアと連邦の両方の並外れた性質を国民に伝える事によって、将来の統一のために彼らの中に新たに見出された愛国心を奨励する事が提案された。\n\n更に、我々の独立した楽観的な精神、名誉ある奉仕をする者への投票権の提供など、国における特定の例外的な特性に焦点を当てる事により、我々はこの愛国心を最も価値のある形に変化させる事ができる。"
 NOV_hybridize_the_state_apparatus: "国家機構の統合"
 NOV_hybridize_the_state_apparatus_desc: "国家機関の創設について決断を下さなければならないため、軍と民間の組織を統合し、機能、影響力、幕僚、指導部などを新しい混成形態に統合するように行動する事が提案されている。これは明らかに優れた選択肢である。\n\n両方の部門はそれぞれ我々の国家安全保障の状況に密接に関連しており、直接影響を及ぼすだろう。また別々に存在する事によって敵が悪用する多くの脆弱性が存在するため、一つに統合する事でこれらの機会の数を減らし、国家をより安全にするだろう。"

 NOV_look_to_our_roots_desc: "国家機関の創設について決断を下さなければならないため、連邦主義の原則を強化することにより、基本的な慣行に沿って我々の制度の強化に焦点を当てる事が提案されている。これは明らかに最適な選択である。\n\n連邦は、統制された民主主義と連邦主義の慣行による強力なルーツに沿って設立された。国家の全体的なアイデンティティを脅かすために、何らかの理由でこれらの妥協を許すことはできない。一部の懸念にも関わらず、我々の状態は安全であり続けるだろう、それが真実であり続ける事によって。"

 NOV_sunrise_democracy_sunset_dictatorship_desc: "夜明けが連邦の大地に来る時、国家機関は民主主義の入り口でその光を歓迎する。そこでは一日の初めから行政長官と官僚が国民に奉仕する。地方の票を数え、経済政策を調整し、商品の流通を指示する事は全て国民がよく世話される事を保証するという名目で行われる。正午、公務員が昼食に行く時、大統領とシロヴィキは支持を求め国を巡行する。しかし、彼以前のツァーリ、皇帝、書記長、首相のように、彼の権力は決して問題ではなかった。陽が落ちて大地が暗くなると、治安部隊は街の通りをうろつき、正義の独裁に反対する国民を根絶しようとする。\n\nこのように、連邦の暗黙の標語は、日の出の民主主義、正午の君主制、そして日の入りの独裁制である。シベリアの大地は静かになり、共産主義者や理想主義者からではないにせよ、欺瞞のささやきは聞こえなくなった。ロシアの鼓動する心臓だけが沈黙の中でその音を保っている。"
 NOV_order_and_stability: "秩序と安定"
 NOV_order_and_stability_desc: "敵政府下にあるロシアの諸地域を取り戻し、領土を拡大する事は良いが、解放された地域内の秩序を維持し、我々の管理下でそれらを確保するために努力しない場合、その後の混乱と不安は我々の支配が続く間、生産において非常に悪い害を及ぼす可能性がある。\n\n駐屯軍の拡大と警察の駐留の強化は、我々がロシアの他の政府から奪う地域で行使する権力において驚異的であり、イデオロギーに関係なく、誰も我々の計画に反対する勇気が無い事を保証する。最近獲得した物であれ、国の忠実な部分であれ、支配下にある土地全体に秩序と安定が早く取り戻されるほど、我々の支配を実現するために良好な安定した統治をより早く行使することができる。"
 NOV_temporary_military_governors: "一時的な軍政"
 NOV_temporary_military_governors_desc: "残念ながら、文民政府を通じて機会が与えられた場合、新たに解放された地域がすぐに過激主義に陥らないことは信頼できない。そのため、連邦に真に統合される前に秩序を維持し、過激派の理想を根絶するために、全ての新たな領土を一時的な軍政の下に置くという新しい法律を可決する。\n\n軍政長官は、特定の行動に対するノヴォシビルスク政府からの直接の命令を除き、疑われる反逆的な活動に対処する絶対的権限を与えられる。これは絶対に必要な期間だけ続くが、そのような地域の人々の間で受け入れられる可能性は低いので、可能であれば彼らをさらに動揺させないように軍政長官に警告しなければならない。"
 NOV_the_industrial_preservation_act: "産業保全法"
 NOV_the_industrial_preservation_act_desc: "工場は兵士の武装を保ち続けるが、非武装の兵士はあまり戦えないため、産業は戦争を行う上で重要な部分である。しかし、現在の発展速度では産業基盤は我々の拡大に追いつく事ができず、供給ラインが希薄になる事は軍がより多くの戦死者を出し、又は敗北さえ意味するかもしれない。\n\nそのため、現在の工場の維持管理を継続し、新たな工場の建設速度を向上させるために産業保全法が提案されている。この法律により我々はさらなる工業化を達成し、したがって現在のロシア統一のペースを維持することができる。ロシアの統一が早ければ早いほど良いという事は間違いないだろう。"

 NOV_maintain_the_trans_siberian_railway_desc: "シベリア横断鉄道は、この地域の動脈として機能し、最も重要な都市や町との間の重要な接続路であり、政府の継続的な運営に繋がる。それを荒廃させる事は我々の計画にとって致命的となる可能性があるため、単なるミスでは済まされない。また、兵士の輸送が容易であるため、あまりにも荒廃してしまうと兵站の支援が失われてしまう。\n\n更に、地方及び全国両方の経済の多くは、鉄道の継続的な成功に依存しているのだ。我々はすぐに修理を必要としているそれらの部分に手を付け、最高の状態に戻す事、そしてそれが同様の状況に陥らないよう将来的によく維持することに着手しなければならない。"

 NOV_stamping_out_the_embers_desc: "全てのシベリア人の心には、反逆と理想主義の炎が存在している。ブハーリンは、ソビエト連邦指導者としての全ての失敗のためにシベリアのプロメテウスとなった。共産主義国家の灰から生まれたのは、イデオロギー論争と規律に精通した思想家、理想と暴力の扇動者、火と革新の使者である。この燃えるような情熱の集大成である中央シベリア共和国は、目的地への道に風が吹くとすぐに粉々になってしまった。\n\nシベリアの中心部にある我らの聖域から、我々の連邦は中央シベリア共和国の残党を打ち負かし、行進した。そこで我々はこう言うのだ。理想主義の残忍さやイデオロギーの無意味な浪費、人道的な情熱の際限なき怒りなど必要ない、と。そして我々の靴底が残り火の最後の筋に落ちる時、我々の周りで、我々の中で燃えた火にこう言う。過去と未来の日々は過ぎ去った。現在しかない、と。"
 NOV_a_sovereign_heartland: "至上なる心臓部"
 NOV_a_sovereign_heartland_desc: "喧騒に満ち溢れた市場の跡を静寂が包み込む。かつての中央シベリア共和国では、異郷の商人たちが思想という品々を持ち寄り、日々取引を行っていた。だが屋台は砂利道と化した街道に放り出され、品物は薪にくべられた。あとは火に焼かれるのを待つばかりだ。ナロードニキ、共産主義者、アナキスト、思想家、リューリク朝。全ては人間の革新と改善の意図を装った偽りの司祭である。彼らが提供する物は何もかも主権によって人を教化する事はできなかった。騒音と喧騒は無意味な戯れに他ならないのだ。\n\n連邦は沈黙を受け入れた。かつて理想が崇拝されていた場所で、我々はこれらの模造の神像を引きずり出し、追い出した。イデオロギーに高貴な物は何もなく、より高い理想を信じるという行為は人を模範にする物ではない。イデオロギーの残忍さは終わりを告げ、主権者は最高位に独りで君臨する。"

 NOV_the_victorious_federation_desc: "ついに中央シベリアは我々の権威の下に統一された。地域のライバルは打ち負かされ、彼らの支持者達はバラバラに隠れるか亡命していった。しかし我々の連邦の継続的な成功のために多くの作業が残されている。\n\nまず、新たな領土をより緊密に統合し、境界線を確保する事によって戦利品を整理するという問題がある。次に我々は、切実に必要とされている法、秩序、安定性を回復する事を目指し、支配を安定させて国民を満足させる方法を検討しなければならない。"

 NOV_bread_and_games_desc: "何よりも平時の国民は、自らの食べるパンと娯楽用のゲームの2つだけを望んでいる。これらが提供され簡単に手に入る限り、国民の不幸や不安の原因はほとんど無くなる。そのため過激派組織が成長し力を得る余地はほぼ無くなるのだ。\n\nこれを達成するためにはいくらかの犠牲を払わなければならないが、それでもそれらは国の現在そして将来の安定に値する以上の物である。"

 NOV_appoint_new_governors_desc: "新たに征服された領土に軍政長官を任命する慣行は我々にとって非常に役立つ物であったが、我々が置かれていた状況の脆弱性のためにそれは常に一時的な措置である事が意図されていた。\n\n我々がより安全な立場にあるので、ついにそれらを取り除くという約束を果たし、新しい領土の連邦への統合と安定性の回復を支援するために新しい知事を任命し、国民の不安を軽減する時が来た。"

 NOV_enshrine_the_silovik_state_desc: "我々は何よりも国家の安定と強さの原則に基づいて構築され、その能力を証明した軍の将校により管理される国家の思想を推し進めなければならない。\n\n連邦の下でロシア全土を統一させるには有能な人員が必要であり、安定と安全を二次的な懸念として考えていた中央シベリア共和国などの過去の失敗例は、この構造体の、平和のための必要性をさらに証明しただけである。"

 NOV_reward_our_allies_desc: "約束は約束である。我々は危機の間に企業という友人にかなりの数の約束をしてきた。我々が差し迫った危険にさらされていない今、彼らはこれらの約束が守られる事を期待しており、我々の政府は常に少なくともその期待に応えてきた。\n\n我々は彼らに連邦との新しくより寛大な契約を与え、彼らが我々の管理下にある新しい領土の資源に進出し、利用できるようにする。これは我々の目的に対する彼らの過去の投資を有益な物にし、我々との継続的な協力が彼らの最善の利益になる事を彼らに納得させるだろう。"

 NOV_a_nod_to_democracy: "民主主義への会釈"
 NOV_a_nod_to_democracy_desc: "我々全員を惨めに失敗させた体制にもう一度頼るのは賢明では無いように思われるかもしれないが、主に我々の政府を受け入れる事を躊躇する国民をなだめるのに役立つという事で、彼らに民主主義のより大きな定規を与えるために行われるべき議論がある。\n\nこれは、国内の小さな譲歩と改革の形をとるだけでなく、民間人と民主的権力の支持者により多くの指導的地位を開くだろう。もちろん我々は人々が我々に対して真の権力を持つ事を許可するまでは行かないが、彼らに対する我々の支配を縮小させるように見せる事により、彼らは我々の目的を果たす事にもっと熱心になるかもしれない。"
 NOV_a_controlled_political_spectrum: "制御された政治的スペクトル"
 NOV_a_controlled_political_spectrum_desc: "彼らが再び権力を握る可能性はほとんど無いが、左右の極端な活動の野心を過小評価しないことが常に賢明である。\n\n彼らを弱体化させ、それによって我々の政府を強化するために、彼らを互いに戦わせ、彼らの危険で暴力的な性質を国民に確信させながら、ささいなイデオロギー闘争で彼らの気を逸らし、それによって我々が公然と行動する必要なしに彼らをゆっくりと我々と関係無しに縮小させられる。そうすることで我々は連邦内のすべての政治性を支配し、扇動者を抑制する。"
 NOV_consider_barnauls_position: "バルナウルの地位への熟考"
 NOV_consider_barnauls_position_desc: "ノヴォシビルスクは連邦の行政の中心地かもしれないが、隣接するバルナウル市も国の要である。その市長、ヴァシーリー・シュクシンは、権力の中枢で2番目に強力な政治家に素早く成長し、国家がどのように運営されるべきかについての彼の特有の見解もより顕著になった。\n\n残念ながらシュクシンの台頭は、彼の主なライバルであるポクルィシュキン大統領との予測の容易い緊張を引き起こした。それが制御不能になる前にこの喧嘩を止めるため、恐らくはシュクシンに手を差し伸べて彼が何らかの方法で妥協する気があるかどうかを確認するのが賢明だろう。"
 NOV_the_vestiges_of_revolt: "反乱の傷跡"
 NOV_the_vestiges_of_revolt_desc: "The scars of the Workers' Revolt still remain, and if nothing is done soon they will continue to fester unabated. We must remind the working class of Siberia that no matter what their grievances may be with our administration, rebellion will not be tolerated.\n\nIn addition to repairing the damage still left over from the fighting, we will restore order to the industrial sectors of the region and let any potential dissenters know that we are still in charge. Several methods have been proposed, and it will ultimately be up to our wise and noble President to decide which would be the best course of action."
 NOV_the_sovereign_security_act: "主権安全保障法"
 NOV_the_sovereign_security_act_desc: "国民の安全が危機に瀕している時の予防策はそれほど徹底的では無い！テロリストや革命家になる可能性のある者は隅々まで潜んでおり、彼らに対処するための現在の手法はもはや十分では無いのだ。そのためより強力な鉄拳制裁が必要である。\n\n主権安全保障法は、暗い時代の救世主となるだろう。対反乱部隊は効率を高めて任務を遂行するための資金と物資を増やし、隠遁する敵に悪用された特定の政治的自由を取り締まる。これは国民にとって不人気となる行為だろうが、我々の都市が再び安全になった場合に彼らがそのような措置の必要性を理解することを願っている。"
 NOV_sensible_concessions: "賢明なる譲歩"
 NOV_sensible_concessions_desc: "労働者の不安を防ぐためには厳しい手腕が必要だと言う人もいるが、彼らはそのような方法が労働者の怒りを更に煽るだけであることに気づいていない。我々が今「必要としている」最後の事は、前の災害の残り火にガソリンを注ぐような物だ。つまり、恐らく別のアプローチが必要である。\n\n私たちは、著名な労働組合長と労働運動家に連絡を取り双方にとって最善となる、ある種の取り決めを練り上げる。成功すれば一石二鳥だ。労働者は我々に反抗する理由が無くなり、我々の産業はついに過去の栄光を手に入れることができる。今やる事は合意をする事だけだ。"
 NOV_maintaining_the_equilibrium: "平衡を維持"
 NOV_maintaining_the_equilibrium_desc: "数ヶ月ぶりに我々の都市にようやく反乱前の秩序が戻ってきたが、まだやるべき事はある。統一戦争の亡霊は今でも新たな領土に出没しており、連邦が大胆で新しい未来に前進したいのならば、彼らを窮地に立たせる必要がある。\n\n警察の存在感が高められると、新たに目をつけられた者は愚かな行動をとる事ができなくなるが、強力な軍事的示威行動は戦いの半分にすぎない。これらの問題ある領土の統合を完了するための最良の方法を議論するため、シベリア全土の州知事及び市長との会議が開催される。運が良ければ、安定性という名目によってあまり多くの譲歩をする必要が無くなるだろう。"
 NOV_active_measures: "積極的な対策"
 NOV_active_measures_desc: "歴史の流れに自分の勝手で影響を与える方法は数多くある。これらの方法のいくつかは小規模に見えるかもしれないが、物事の壮大な計画に大きな変化をもたらす。つまり、船の進路を少しだけ変えるだけで目的地が全く変わってしまう、という事だ。なお、この場合の目的地は強力で安定したロシアである。\n\n我々の治安部隊は、目的に合うように一連の出来事を操作する事に対し異論を言わない。いくつかの不正なメディアキャンペーン、1つか2つ程の偽造文書……我々の調査員がしなければならないのは、見えざる糸を引く事である。結局の所、無知な市民は満足しているのだ……"

 NOV_the_siberian_economy_desc: "中央シベリアの統合によってシベリア内の莫大な富と可能性が開かれた。シベリアには、太平洋からモスクワにかけてその力を拡大する強力なロシア国家の基盤となる可能性があるのだ。\n\nシベリアの可能性を適切に実現するため、すでに印象的な産業基盤を活用し、この地域の富を活用する必要がある。覇権企業の助けを借りることで、我々の経済成長は本当に恐ろしいものになるだろう。"
 NOV_establish_educational_standards: "教育水準の確立"
 NOV_establish_educational_standards_desc: "我々の国民がこれといった教育を受けずに人生を送っているのに、世界規模の経済を育成することを望めるだろうか？教育制度が混乱していることは、そもそもそのような制度が無いことを仄めかしている。実際には、適切な教育機関に似た物は20年以上前にソビエト連邦の他の地域と共に深淵に葬られた。\n\n最終的には適切な教育体制の基礎を築こう。連邦の学生が現代世界の方式で教育されていることを確かめるため、学校の新たなカリキュラムとガイドラインを開発するべきだ。"

 NOV_lessons_of_the_unification_wars_desc: "戦争とは厳しいものであり、犯した全ての失敗は敵に優位性を与えることになる。シベリア統一戦争を通して、我々は軍の効力、能力、長所、そして最も重要なことにその短所についても多くを学んだ。\n\n過去数回の戦争は、我が軍のいくつかの明白な弱点を明らかにした。我々は兵士が得意とする事と非常に不得意な事を教えられた。これらは苦労して得た教訓であり、軍事ドクトリンの改善と近代化に取り組んでいる時には忘れてはならないことである。我が軍がこれらの教訓を学び直すことが無いようにしよう。"

 NOV_our_eastern_bastion_desc: "マガダンの港湾都市は、かつてはそれほど重要ではなく、ロシア東部の地図にも描かれていなかった。無政府状態の数十年の間にロシア最大の未占領の港として重要となったが、それを支配した様々な軍閥による何年にも渡る改善のにも関わらず、我々の主要港としての機能はほとんど果たされていない。\n\nロシア再建のために世界各国と膨大な量の貿易とビジネスを行う必要があるが、ロシアの貿易能力は港の能力に制限されてきたため、企業、政府の両者はマガダンにもっと投資し、世界への新たな玄関口への変革を遂行するよう促してきた。それに応えればマガダンは課せられた責務に相応しいものとなり、世界市場への完全で自由な通行権をついに得られるだろう。"

 NOV_demokratizatsiya: "Demokratizatsiya（民主化）"
 NOV_demokratizatsiya_desc: "シュクシンの勝利は自由ロシアの大義のための勝利であるが、それは民主主義への道の第一歩に過ぎない。ポクルィシュキンと彼の付き人は、権力を構築し、ロシアを再び一党独裁に変貌させるための最悪な行動に何年も費やしてきた。彼らの努力を取り消すには時間がかかるため、我々は国家が大きな変化に備えるための小さな改革から始めなければならない。\n\n近いうちに政府は「Demokratizatsiya（民主化）」と呼ばれる新たな政策を開始するだろう。地方から始まり、ロシア国民は指導者と議員を選出できるようになるはずだ。十分で恒久的な選挙態勢が整えば、ついに定期的に選挙を開催させることができるようになる。そしてその他には、任期制限の施行と、政府の様々な部門の間の権力分立を実施するための準備が含まれる。"
 NOV_curb_the_corporations: "企業の抑制"
 NOV_curb_the_corporations_desc: "先日、企業活動にいくつかの名ばかりな制限を設ける新たな法律が制定された。制限はせいぜい些細なことであり、ほとんどの場合、株式取引に対する政府の監視を最小限にすることと関係があるが、提案された法律は1つの理由で依然として国民や企業から大きな注目を集めている。以前、このような法律は否決されていたが、今では案が通るようになったのだ。\n\nシュクシン大統領はこの法律を完全に支持し、支持者に対しても同様の対応を勧めた。理論上は、実際には名ばかりの努力であるが、それはシュクシンが企業と癒着していないことを国中に知らせるものである。彼らの影響力をすぐに消すことはできないかもしれないが、ロシア企業がロシア人を外貨を使って搾取する時代はもう終わることを世界に教えられるだろう。"
 NOV_dreams_of_federation: "連邦の夢"
 NOV_dreams_of_federation_desc: "When it was originally conceived, the Russian Federation was supposed to be Russia's best chance at democracy. The idealism of the Central Siberian Republic was always doomed to failure, but the Federation could provide a practical, reasonable alternative that would reunite the Russian lands and peoples and secure a future defined by freedom and stability. What it morphed into under Pokryshkin's rule was a bastardized, authoritarian imitation of the original goal, but the damage can still be undone.\n\nSlowly, surely, the people of Russia are starting to wake up. They are realizing that this new President's promises are not false, and his words are not empty. The Russian Federation really can be a nation of practical democracy rather than corrupt authoritarianism. After decades of bitter winters, spring is coming to the Motherland."
 NOV_business_as_usual: "通常業務"
 NOV_business_as_usual_desc: "In a result that surprised no one, the people of Russia have voted to continue Pokryshkin's reign as President of the Federation, picking his record of success and commitments to stability over Shukshin's radical promises of liberalization and weakened government. Acquisitions from the opposition of vote tampering and suppression have been widely dismissed by the media and the people, and the stage is set for the Siberian Falcon's rule to continue.\n\nThe President knows that this is no time for a weakened government and a divided people. Russia is still divided, and there are enemies within and without our borders who will work nonstop to tear down what we have built. The President will not let them. He has brought us this far, and the Russian people know that only he can lead them through what is to come. To change course now would only be to steer into a storm."

It was a beautiful time of unfettered idealism and shaky hope in a murky future, and in between debates and briefings, Ob's glimmering waters were always waiting for him. He would find a perch on the rocks, gazing out at the gently rippling waters and listening to the distant cries of birds over the murmur of the river. Idle thoughts would drift lazily through his head or on some days, he would scribble away at some unborn writing project, or simply lay upon the shore in a half asleep stupor dreaming of things to come.\n\nNow, however, things were changing. The waters were getting filthier by the day as more businesses moved into town, raising factories and more along the Ob's bank. Although the Federation, and Shukshin's own values, lay based upon freedom, he could not help but feel perhaps it was leniency that had allowed these industrialists to lay claim to his home. In several meetings, Shukshin had brought up his misgivings with the direction of the town's development only to find many of his trusted aides in the pocket of the very same hounds preying upon Barnaul's newfound prosperity. Thus, he went out to the river once again to think. Shukshin felt conflicted with the idea of pushing the pocketed officials out, as each had gotten there through their own merit. Part of him felt it was vanity, the idea of holding something as trivial as the beauty of the nostalgic river over his own values. In the fields just beyond the river, however, he saw men breaking their backs for a day's wage dropped like crumbs by richer men. Was this corruption, in and of itself, a greater tyranny?\n\nStill, he would have to tackle this problem some other way. But how, when it felt only he could see Russia's pain?"

Langemak had chosen today in hopes of slighting the Mayor, but alas.\n\nHowever, the contract the government shall sign with the Sibir Corporation would bring them closer together. Langemak smirked. Pokryshkin knew how these corporations worked. The bottom line was far more crucial to the livelihood of these companies than infrequent visits from an eccentric actor-politician. He took a seat and waited, checking his watch in-between reading magazines sponsored by the Sibir. Most of them were agriculture-related, and most of them depicted golden fields of wheat, their grains undulating under the gentle wind.

Now though, he could properly enjoy an unbiased paper run by right-thinking Russians telling it like it is.\n\nSitting at the fireplace with a cup of tea and a newspaper felt quite nostalgic for him. On the front page was a picture of striking workers surrounded by corporate security forces. The headline read, \"Sibir Workers' Strike! Blood on the Streets.\" Intrigued, he read through the report. Apparently, workers at a Sibir plant went on strike for higher wages and ended up rioting and killing several Sibir guards.

Though his youthful face was now marred by shrapnel scars, the smile on his lips could not be denied. His comrades stopped and saluted as he passed, a fact which took him by surprise even now after months among their ranks.\n\nHe walked into the deepest layers of the bunker, towards the command center. As he walked, he could not help but reminisce. His first mission with the Narodniks had been a resounding success. The plant had been destroyed and the weapon schematics had been vital to the continued success of the movement. From there, Siniy had participated in countless operations against Federation forces and the corporations they served. Magnates and politicians had fallen by his hands, entire Federation supply convoys had been hijacked and diverted, and in one particularly memorable mission he had destroyed an entire Titan manufacturing plant with little more than a pipe bomb and a well placed bottle of American soda.\n\nFinally, he entered the command center. Every surface was covered in maps, mission briefings, and reports. At the center of this controlled chaos was the leader of the movement, Comrade Chernyy. Chernyy was an old, grizzled veteran of the Great Patriotic War.\n\n\"Welcome back, Comrade Siniy. I hope you are well rested. It has come time to go forward with our decapitation strike. The bastard Pokryshkin will be attending the demonstration of some new kind of fighter plane. It will be your duty to kill the bastard.\" Siniy was in shock. The magnitude of this mission eclipsed any he had embarked in before. Pokryshkin's death would be the culmination of years of planning, and it all came down to him.\n\nHe was ready."
 NOV.25.a: "Pride goeth before a fall."
 NOV.26.t: "Margelov's Men"
 NOV.26.desc: "Looking on in disgust, General Vasily Margelov reviewed the airborne troops before him. While they were certainly finer men than most the Federation had to offer, that currently did not mean much. They were relatively out of shape, possessed outdated equipment, and most of all were simply outrageous to any general with good sense, which Margelov liked to consider himself to be. If he didn't know better he'd swear that some of these men were more rat-eaten than their parachutes, though that also wasn't saying much.\n\nThey needed modernization badly, especially in these times, with the Federation surrounded by enemies and potential enemies. There was no question about that. The only question was, how should he go about modernizing them? Their training was in the most obvious need of reform, so certainly he should start there. Even if he were to acquire the finest of materiel, they'd be no good in the hands of men unworthy of holding them. One of the airborne troops was startled awake by his passing, nearly falling over, and Margelov glared at the man in contempt.\n\nThis was certainly going to be a long and arduous journey."
 NOV.26.a: "At least it isn't too late."
 NOV.27.t: "Memories of the War"
 NOV.27.desc: "\"Gentlemen, it is an honor to have Mr. Suvorov, a veteran of the legendary Siberian War, here with us today. Please welcome him!\" The applause as the respected veteran rose from his seat was much louder than when the seemingly irrelevant commander had stood up to introduce him. After greeting his old friends, he sat down again to speak to the young recruits about his experience. Question after question, he answered them all directly and with honesty.\n\n\"Mr. Suvorov, how did you come to be an instructor in the Federation's Army?\" one of the soldiers asked.\n\nThe veteran was quick to reply. \"You see, back when I was in the army, things were not so bright in these lands. The old republic was fighting a seemingly endless war against Yagoda's hawks, but it was failing and I felt like I had to do something about it. That was when I met President Pokryshkin, who was one of the few to look at the situation not through an overly idealistic lens.\" He was interrupted by someone asking if he had really met the President, but he shrugged it off as nothing too important. \"He was planning to bring peace to Novosibirsk and Altay, and I decided to join him in the endeavour. As you know, he succeeded, and here we are.\"\n\n\"Mr. Suvorov, is it true you fought off a communist tank on your own?\"\n\n\"That is a real story, yes...\" he replied chuckling. \"We had been in the forests up north when we were attacked by a tank unit. I was away from my platoon, but I was quick enough to grab an old anti-tank weapon and fire it. Unfortunately, others were not so lucky - one of my friends died trying to distract an invading unit.\" There was silence for a moment. \"But the mission was still successful. It was sacrifices like these that got us where we are now, and it is sacrifices like these that will be necessary to restore order to the nation, once and for all. Any other questions?\""
 NOV.27.a: "Old soldiers never die..."
 NOV.28.t: "Up in the Sky"
 NOV.28.desc: "As his old plane, a gift from the Free Aviators, weaved through the skies, Alexander Pokryshkin could not help but reminisce about the war. He remembered the sounds of explosions, the shrieking of rending metal and the screams of wounded men; he remembered the words of Horst-Wessel-Lied as the Germans blared it from every radio tower in Moscow, and last of all, he remembered the flight east, and the tens of hundreds of thousands of good people who had perished to the Jackboot's inexorable march.\n\nNot all was lost, he told himself as he watched the ground underfoot, the ant-sized soldiers that drilled on top of it. He had this. Pokryshkin didn't want to be a leader to a flight squadron, much less a state, and yet those under his care had not only survived, they had thrived. Things weren't perfect, of course, the terrorists plaguing his lands were proof of that, but nevertheless, life was tolerable.\n\nHe pushed the stick forward, a smile filling his weathered face as he dived down. He never really had time to fly these days, nor the opportunity. Always an AA gun from Tomsk or Kemerovo, always a Kazakh raiding party that had strayed too far, always a foe that needed combating - but today was not one of those days. Today he was free.\n\nAs he wheeled around to face home, Pokryshkin couldn't help but marvel at the city his forces controlled. The smoke of the factories of Novosibirsk was almost comforting, and the distant booming and lights of artillery that had once been terrifying felt in some strange way familial.\n\nHe hadn't wanted to be a leader, but he knew that if he did not fight for his people, then someone far worse than he would. As long as he still drew breath, the Siberian Falcon would defend the people of Novosibirsk, and perhaps one day, all of Russia."

 NOV.29.t: "Fertile Lands, New Beginnings"
 NOV.29.desc: "Konstantin had been rootless for many years. Originally from Tambov, he and his family had fled eastwards during the German invasions and subsequent state collapse and, like so many others, had found themselves with almost nothing, having to leave all land and possessions behind.\n\nArriving alongside thousands of others in the refugee communities outside Novosibirsk, he had scraped by as a laborer when able, while his wife worked in a laundry and his sons ran errands for merchants and artisans. But, no matter what they did, they could not get ahead. There were simply too many people, and not enough well-paying jobs.\n\nThe years of bitter disappointment were such that when his wife told him to sign up for the government's supposed new program, he almost had not done so, thinking it pointless. But now, standing along the road beside her and looking at the vast tracts of overgrown wildlands in front of them, he silently gave thanks once again. Because the land was now theirs.\n\nThe program intended to address the refugee 'problem' by settling them on vast tracts of untilled land, removing them from the overpopulated communities while, hopefully, acting to increase agricultural output. Konstantin didn't know how successful the former would be, but he knew very well that, at least in his case, the latter very much would be. He would make sure of it.\n\nThere was a lot of very hard work to do. The house had to be essentially rebuilt. The fields needed to be cleared and planted. Harvests needed to be planned. Konstantin had never been a farmer, but the future promised for his family could not be ignored.\n\nThey had a home again. Land to call their own. And he would ensure that the state was repaid for its generosity."
 NOV.29.a: "The state provides."
 NOV.30.t: "Managerial Response"
 NOV.30.desc: "Thousands of workers were on strike outside of a steel mill in the industrial sector of Novosibirsk. All across the city, similar strikes were being carried out in outrage at the appalling conditions present in the factories. Corporate security guards made a loose and patchy ring around the striking workers, waiting for orders from their superiors on just what to do.\n\nVasily Minkovsky stood in front of the crowd and gave a fiery speech about the injustices of the corporations. He harkened back to the times under Bukharin, where the workers were given generous rights and conditions in the factories were as safe as they could be made. Behind him was hung a tattered flag of the Soviet Union. The workers of Novosibirsk had decided they would not stand for their continued abuse.\n\nAs he came to a lull in his oratory there was a change in the air. The corporate goons had retreated to the offices across the street, and it soon became obvious why. Two corporate IFVs rolled down the street towards the crowd, a man with a megaphone calling for the strikers to return to work. When his demands were unanswered the IFVs unleashed canisters of teargas into the crowd. Cries went up as those nearest the gas panicked and fled, eyes and lungs burning. Corporate goons advanced on the crowd, beating those they caught with batons.\n\nThen a shot rang out.\n\nPanicking workers trampled each other to get out of the line of fire while corporate security fired wantonly into the crowd. Vasily tried to regain some semblance of calm, but it was in vain as he was hit in the gut by a burst of fire from a panicking guard. He fell, reaching for the flag of the Union. As he bled out watching his friends be gunned down by trigger happy guards, he wept."

 NOV.31.desc: "It was a stormy night in Novosibirsk as Anton took his seat. The other Narodniks were talking to each other, but he wanted to lay low. Barely any background checks, did the Narodniks suspect him, or were they just that incompetent? As an undercover agent of the SB, Anton hoped he wasn't being fed false information. Immediately after sitting down, a man wearing an old army uniform entered into the room, differing in age compared to the mostly young students who made up the Narodnik cell. \"Good evening, comrades,\" said the older man. \"I am pleased to welcome our newest recruit, Anton Levitsky, to the revolution. As you know, our fight against the tyrannical Alexander Pokryshkin is only just beginning. The Narodniks as a whole have seen much success, yet our cell has done little to assist the rest of our comradery. If the revolution is to succeed, we must aim for larger targets.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Said Anton, turning on his audio recorder. \"The army has stepped up their game, and we have become a massive priority for the Novosibirsk government.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you know of the many rail lines that cross the Ob River,\" said the commander. \"Taking down an entire bridge will have Novosibirsk cut in half for months!.\n\nAnton grimaced while the other Narodniks cheered. \"If I may ask, commander, but where are we going to get enough explosives to destroy the bridge, and who's going to do it? Looking around, we don't seem very qualified,\" Anton said.\n\n\"The commander smiled. \"We have an excellent amount coming in from our supplier, and Anton, you applied saying you were a demolitions expert in the Red Army, did you not? I think you'll be perfect for the job. Supervised, of course.\""
 NOV.31.a: "\"Looks like I'm blowing up a bridge for the Narodniks, then.\""
 NOV.32.t: "Sabotaging the Saboteurs"
 NOV.32.desc: "Anton stood on the riverside near the bridge as he toyed with the fuse. He was the Narodnik's new detonation man, and while the commander was supposed to supervise him, that didn't stop Anton from sneaking into the bomb's storage room last night to defuse the bombs. The Narodniks would soon be sorely disappointed. \"Well Anton, looks like everything is ready,\" said Pavel, his cell commander, still wearing that old uniform.\n\nTaking out a lighter, Anton took a breath and lit the fuse. \"We should probably run farther back, there's a clearing a ways away that should lead to a good escape.\" And the group of officers waiting to arrest them, Anton thought to himself. He couldn't risk these terrorists getting another chance, even though it was so soon since he joined.\n\n\"Are you kidding, and missing this beautiful explosion? We can head to that ridge instead,\" replied Pavel, and the others agreed.\n\n\"Wait-\" but it was too late, the others were already following their commander. Anton cursed under his breath and ran after them.\n\nReaching the ridge, Pavel frowned. \"Anton, why hasn't the bridge exploded yet? Did the fuse break?\"\n\nAnother Narodnik pointed to the bridge. \"Commander, the SB! We've got to get out of here!\" Looking at the bridge, it appeared the officers had realized the Narodniks were not falling for Anton's trap, instead heading over to cut the fuse.\n\n\"Shit! We've got to go before they see us.\" Anton froze, if he shouted the other SB agents might be able to end it all right there, but some of the Narodniks were armed. Anton looked back to see some of the Narodniks running, and the rifle in the man's arms next to him."

Pavel stopped in front of Anton, looking him in the eye. Anton, how do you think the SB knew we were targeting that bridge?\"\n\n\"I don't know sir, perhaps-\"\n\nThe commander interrupted, \"Anton, the SB came out of a clearing, the same clearing you wanted us to escape into. Is that just a coincidence?\"\n\nAnton gulped, pressing down the button to signal the ambush. It was time. He just hoped the Narodniks didn't shoot him on sight.\n\nA crash came from upstairs, the beginning of the raid. SB agents flooded into the room, down the stairs. Before Pavel knew what was happening, Anton had already grabbed the pistol out of Pavel's belt, holding it to his head. \"Pavel Orlov, you are under arrest for treason against the Federation.\"\n\nThe commander laughed, \"Looks like my suspicions were correct, then. You answered more... directly than I would have thought. Comrades, the time has come, let's show we don't go down without a fight!\"\n\nThe other Narodniks looked at him, then to Anton, then to the SB agents.

 NOV.34.desc: "CLASSIFIED\n\nMultiple suspects are currently under investigation for disturbing the peace, inciting violence, and for multiple charges of conspiracy. Threat posed by these terrorists is unknown at this time. However, suspects appear to be involved with the Narodniks, and appear to have capacity to successfully perform industrial sabotage across numerous locations.\n\nSuspects discovered putting up posters inciting anti-government propaganda, and several suspects discovered distributing weapons to various workers amongst the population. After interrogation, several of these workers informed our agents that the suspects wished for the workers to \"overthrow the bourgeoisie\" and \"bring about the workers' revolution.\" Several workers were given components capable of constructing an explosive device roughly equivalent to C4. No suspects were captured, and escaped to unknown locations.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is clear that terrorists amongst our population are targeting working class demographics, and these terrorists appear to be aligned with Bolshevik organizations. Further investigation is required, but it is recommended that the suspects described on the following page be located and arrested immediately. Industrial sabotage could prove fatal while our government is so reliant on a handful of industrial centers."

 NOV.35.desc: "CLASSIFIED\n\nREFERENCE: Documents 7A-7F, which detail in-depth profiling of top suspects and photos of the crime scene.\n\nAt 1100 hours, a worker employed in a Feniks arms manufacturing plant detonated an IED while on break. The worker in question, named Ivan Yahontov, was seriously injured in the blast, but was located and detained by civilian authorities. Yahontov had been associating with suspected Narodniks for several weeks prior to the bombing, and appears to have collaborated with two other individuals: Sergei Preobrazhensky (died in the explosion), and Alexei Turgenev (Reported sick day of the incident, was not found at his residence when investigated). The manager of the manufacturing plant was not harmed, and is quite incensed by what he sees as the government's failure to contain the Narodnik threat.\n\nCurrent estimates place damages at a cost equivalent to 2,000,000USD. There are 17 reported deaths and over 30 wounded, of which 17 are in critical condition. Currently, 5 employees of the plant are not accounted for, with the site too damaged and obstructed to allow further searches until a later point in time.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Narodnik threat was greater than previous predictions. Multiple requests for greater resources and for more extensive training have been filed at this time. Feniks has also requested compensation for damages sustained by the blast."

Document 2C displays a map of known terrorist hideouts cleared by government authorities, along with locations under immediate investigation.\n\n48 hours ago, several Narodnik agitators were identified and tracked down by our agents in the field. Alongside information extracted from I. Yahontov, a series of raids were conducted. Over 17 arrests have been made against the Narodniks and their allies. Among these arrests are also severely agitated workers distributed weapons by the Narodniks. While not all of the currently arrested terrorists have been interrogated, it was clear that the Narodniks were targeting working class demographics with propaganda, and had already succeeded in converting workers to their cause. Currently, known Narodnik-sympathizers are still being brought in and investigated. Arrests and interrogations are predicted to continue for the next several weeks, until the safety of our industry can be guaranteed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is believed that the Narodniks' capacity to perform industrial sabotage and weaken our government have been substantially impacted by the series of arrests and raids conducted by our forces. The Narodniks will likely not target factories for some time, until they believe government surveillance of factory workers has diminished. It has been requested that this investigation be made a low-priority operation, due to the decreased threat to our industry."

 NOV.37.desc: "The clink, roar and ruin of the mine bit deeply into the brain of Foreman Kostin, who breathed to the deep, heavy rhythm of the coal thumper. It didn't bother him so much as it was a part of him, like a familiar ache or phantom pain. His workers, no, his comrades in labor, toiled away beneath the earth at the behest of the capitalist Siloviks, ruining their bodies in the pursuit of coal.\n\nKostin was not a man known for pessimism, and in his heart burned a great and powerful certainty. The slavery of wage labor and the rotten pustule of capital would eventually come to an end. With the crushing success of the Narodniks and the humiliation of the Novosibirsk government, Kostin's hope had been blown from a flame into a roaring inferno.\n\nLater that day, still beneath the earth, in a forgotten shaft, Kostin and his comrades gathered around pictures of Lenin and Bukharin. Oaths were sworn, toasts drunk, and a promise made."

Kostin had not wanted to believe it, but after the third retelling it had begun to sink in that the news was not mere rumor or Silovik propaganda.\n\nThe Narodniks have been defeated, their leadership gunned down or rounded up in a recent raid, the coda of a long and brutal struggle between the state and the socialists. Kostin angrily hacked away at the stone with his pick, wishing desperately that the reverse had been true. Capitalist oppression continued, and the dawn seemed very far away indeed. As he used his soot-blackened hands to load chunks of stone into the nearby cart, another thought occurred.\n\nWas the dawn so far away? Indeed, the Narodniks had failed in their mission, but so too had the state expended a great deal of time and resources putting them down. The Siloviks were raw, vulnerable. Suddenly, Kostin grinned, white teeth flashing brightly in the darkness. The iron was hot, the workers furious. Perhaps a second revolt would be what was needed to bring the whole structure crashing down."

Terrible security hazard for the President of the Federation to be in public, for something as mundane as a meeting. Yet Seva also knew that in Novosibirsk, a little display of trust often went a long way. The soldier looked toward the reinforced limousine behind him. His boss was no doubt thinking about the meeting ahead. Or thinking about the other meetings of the day. Or not thinking at all, daydreaming about whatever it was that the Siberian Falcon occupied his mind with. Seva knew he couldn't keep up with his boss. That was why the boss was, well, the boss.\n\nAnother dark limousine. A lone man came out around the car, hands empty. Seva stepped forward, his hands away from his own weapon. \"Mr. Chernyshevsky?\" he asked.\n\nThe man shook his head. Opened the door to reveal his own boss, a short stocky type. Seva recognized the man, a former military intelligence analyst. Behind Seva, the door opened. President Pokryshkin emerged from his vehicle. Any tension from the meeting evaporated as the bodyguard stepped aside and the two powerful men shook hands and exchanged formalities. Seva soon found himself holding a crate of documents. Chernyshevsky's bodyguard held a manilla folder. What was in it? Pokryshkin often gave money or financial insider news in such courtesy calls. Chernyshevsky was an up and coming silovik, a man with a growing network of his own. It was good business to pay respect to men of his caliber.\n\nThe conversation over, Chernyshevsky disappeared into his car and drove away at high speed. Seva took note of the riflemen on the roof relaxing their stance. It paid to be prepared for anything, when one worked in the business of presidential security. The bodyguard sat in the back of Pokryshkin's car, finally allowing himself a moment of rest. His boss looked in a particularly jovial mood. Leafing through the intelligence report, the President smiled contentedly. \"It seems that old man Pasternak is on the move again.\"\n\n\"War, boss?\" Seva asked. Pokryshkin shook his head. Smiled.\n\n\"No, not war. But perhaps the end of peace. Russia is waking up.\""

The Narodniks had chosen well: this would be one hell of a tough nut to crack. \"I'll be frank with you,\" said Glinka, his voice flat and grim, \"more than a few of us are going to die breaking into this fortress. From our experience in the Altay, we know that the terrorists have access to S-Mines, so expect the way in to be heavily mined. The door is reinforced steel and it'll take some serious firepower to break it open. Luckily, the Army will be providing what excess explosives they can.\" The crowd was silent, their eyes on Glinka or scouring the battle map on the projector screen.

He shook his head, attempting to clear his senses. Everything stood still for a moment, a perfect crystal eternity that was shattered by the slap on his back plate. Luka suddenly surged forwards, Kalashnikov held at the ready. The concrete tunnels were tight and difficult to fight in, but the breaching blast the SB men had discharged had stunned the Narodniks for the crucial moment needed to take them by surprise.\n\nLuka's gun chattered in the distinctive Kalashnikov language, spitting death at shaken communists. Bullets flew back at Luka and his team, and a round grazed his shoulder, already wounded once by the Narodniks in Altay. Luka ignored the pain, and he and the SB assault team began to clear the bunker, room by room, tunnel by tunnel. It was hard, grueling work, and by the time they had reached the final stretch of corridor, ten of the assault force were dead.\n\nFinally, Luka and the assault troopers stood before the command center door. It was, predictably, reinforced steel, and the demolitions team had already begun to set up a charge. Luka took the opportunity to catch his breath. Around him, the other SB men did the same, sucking in the stale, dusty air of the bunker. After a moment, the rest was over, and the charges detonated. This time, Luka ignored his frazzled senses and rushed inside, shouting for the occupants to surrender.\n\n\"Fuck! Fuck!\" shouted a man covered in pasty white dust, blood trickling from his nose. \"We're done! We give up! Just... just stop killing us.

A large amount of damage has been caused, definitely hampering our industrial capabilities.\n\nWhat is most worrying is that the Narodnik has targetted both civilian and military infrastructure and industries. They seem to have no fear of causing harm to civilians, displaying their brutality. Everything will take time to rebuild, sparking worry in our already struggling economy.

How the assassin even managed to get to Evseev is another mystery.\n\There is no doubt that this is a major tragedy, as every general we have is one of the best in Central Siberia. Evseev's tactics were most useful in the battlefield as a veteran of the Great Patriotic War and the Siberian War.

Many of the Narodniks have been put behind bars, and it seems the rest have gone into hiding or fled Novosibirsk. We won't have to worry about any more major damage in the future, and our government has begun to congratulate the efforts of those involved on the ground in bringing the terrorists down.\n\nWith the Narodnik threat gone, we will no longer have to worry about our factories being sabotaged or rail lines being destroyed.

 NOV.47.desc: "The Silovik State has a unique resource when compared to the other Warlords of Russia. While others may have to rely on ideological similarities, violence, or tense negotiation to work with other warlords, the Silovik State can dig their claws into a nation without them even realizing it. They can tip their rivals for unification in the direction of their own interests. This resource allows the State to snake its way into the government of their rival, slowly aligning the opponent's interest with their own through a gradual takeover of several or all sectors of government and even daily life.\n\nThis resource, of course, is the vast and powerful businesses at the Silovik State's disposal, in addition to the political, economic, and military pressure they can put on their neighbors. See, corporations have a funny way of getting what they want from a country, its people and its government if they're more powerful than their targets- er, clients are stubborn. Economic pressure and integration is a mighty thing, and the first step to that oh so gradual takeover that the Silovik State relies on to move forward."

It was some new feeling, some feeling that combined hate, disappointment, fear and regret, all into one single emotion that went beyond a simple noun. Perhaps depression was the better word, from all the changes that surrounded Pushkin's world.\n\nThe first was seeing his second home, the Humanist headquarters, tapped off by soldiers, denying him and his comrades entrance into the building. \"Your organization,\" said the officer in charge, \"has been outlawed. Disperse, before you are dealt with.\" They did, and the sudden horror dawned on him there of how bad things were going to get.\n\nThe second was much less concrete, but just as real. The morale of the people of Tomsk had been destroyed, sucked up and spat out. Friends, who weeks prior had waved and shared wonderful memories together, barely looked at each other, let alone spoke. The park, once so filled with wandering, smiling faces, had been replaced by soldiers armed to the teeth.\n\nIt was as if all hope, all idealism, had been bleed from them, just as their men had been bleed on the battlefield.\n\nPushkin sighed. Perhaps the grand experiment was never realistic. Perhaps it was better to get your head out of the clouds, and focus on the real world. Maybe these new men, with their hard faces and cold hearts, had the right idea after all."

He sighed, rubbing at his tired eyes.\n\nWhen the Federation troops came pouring in, few could believe it, and, before anyone could even react, the Republic's flag, waving above Tomsk, came tumbling down. It seemed, to Kamov's horrified eyes, that the whole experiment had failed.\n\nAnd the experiment's subjects, the people of Central Siberia, had undergone a change that Kamov, as a scientist, found shocking. Almost over night, the people and their optimism, once so filled with hope and joy, had shriveled up into a rotting husk. And that new atmosphere, the atmosphere of some corporate overlord, had expanded to the research division that Kamov worked in.\n\nAlthough the designs remained the same, the people changed. No longer was radical experimentation allowed. Now, it was all about 'efficiency' and 'results'. No longer would the halls of science be filled with creativity, intrigue, learning, and breakthroughs. Now it was going to be about how to make something easier to manufacture, easier to transport, and easier to make in bulk.\n\nKamov's helicopter was just one victim. He had no motivation to make the best possible, no reason to push the boundaries. Now, he felt like just one more researcher in a sea of thousands, all vying for some nebulous benefit.\n\nAnd it ate Kamov up inside."

For the past twenty minutes, he had been arguing with the mayor of Barnaul over the fate of the so-called Zemsky Sobor, and once again the two men found themselves at an impasse.\n\nMayor Shukshin rubbed his temples, his eyes weary and distant. \"If we keep ripping up local administrations and replacing them, it's only going to mean more work for us. Time we could've spent on more important matters will instead be wasted on sorting out bureaucracy.\" He sighed. \"I'm not suggesting we keep the Sobor, rather, update it to fit our needs.\"\n\nPokryshkin turned to Shukshin. Perhaps his colleague had a point. After all, what's the purpose of demolishing a perfectly functional administration just to replace it with something that serves the same purpose?

At first Sokolov had expected the new job to be easy. How hard could dealing with a couple of backwards peasants really be?\n\nVery, very difficult. Already, he had to deal with the reality that he had no legitimacy. These people did not choose him, an outsider. Sokolov, no matter his personal beliefs, was a member of the Federation government, a distant, unknowable collection of bureaucrats and politicians who knew nothing about them. This Sokolov resented, if only because he had been briefed a significant amount by Zavoloko, who, in his wisdom, thought it would be important for Sokolov to understand the needs of the people. Apparently, Sokolov thought with bitterness, some didn't think that was enough.\n\nHe sighed. Perhaps he was being too negative. He had, over the course of the last couple weeks, been successful in removing most of the incompotent administrators under Zavoloko, who, by and large, were preachers, and not bureaucrats. At the very least it would show that Sokolov was trying to make an effort. Besides, the cash would begin to flow Oyrotia soon, to show how valuable a unified, centralized Russia could be.\n\nPerhaps, Sokolov thought, for the first time in days, these people can learn to trust again."

It wasn't the physique or mannerism of the man that disturbed him, but it was the simple reality of the situation. Coming face to face with the man who overthrew his government, and on the other side of a jail cell, conjured up images that Pesterev would rather not have.\n\nAnd so they sat there, waiting for the other to make a move, up until Pokryshkin spoke up.\n\n\"Mr. Pesterev,\" said Pokryshkin, \"I understand that you and Andreev are on less than stellar terms.\"\n\n\"Considering that I'm in a jail cell, yes, me and him are not exactly the best of friends at the moment.\"\n\nPokryshkin laughed. \"That is understandable. You know, I hate to see such potential wasted, rotting in a cell.

Nor do I think I could learn it in the time necessary to make a difference. That is why I am offering you an opportunity to work for me, for your freedom, and for a better future for Russia. You don't have to decide now, b-\"\n\n\"I'll do it.\"\n\nPokryshkin stopped, a little shocked at being interrupted.

Almost all are holdout generals, militias and other organizations that refused to submit to the will of the Federation, and instead placed their rebellion at the barrel of a gun.\n\nWhat began as outright treasonous acts, openly committed by militiamen, gradually transformed into terrorism against the state and its property. Army compounds were bombed, killing dozens and injuring more. Police headquarters, set up in high population areas, were routinely attacked and looted for firearms, and, as quickly as they were attacked, the HQs were empty of all Red perpetrators.\n\nBut the former Free Territory could only hold out for so long. Soon, as weeks turned to months, some of the diehards began to question whether their acts were in any way helpful to their cause. Soon, as the troops began pouring in, and the compounds and safe houses were raided, the members of the underground Black Army began to dissipate. Some chose to leave the Free Territory, others the whole of Central Siberia. A couple even decided to leave Russia, hoping for a better chance at the revolution abroad.\n\nSome, however, decided to stay, and while they continue their revolutionary activities, the All-Siberian Army has been ever present to combat them. While the remnants may never fully go away, the Siberian Army stands tall and ready to crack whatever resistance remains."

To many others, the outcome was expected, and the shock came from how long it took.\n\nDespite the Federation's best efforts, the imprints of Anarchism could not be fully removed. It had been too embedded into society for that to happen, especially among the working class, who, unsurprisingly, made up most of the Workers' Councils. Kansk was the biggest of them, and threatened outright rebellion against the Federation if such an action was ever taken.\n\nThat, of course, was only rhetoric. Everyone knew that, one way or another, the Workers' Councils would be destroyed. Many even within the Councils debated what course of action to take, but, despite the radicalism of some members, the majority accepted defeat. The Proclamation was expected, and they tried, with the best of their abilities, to make the transition as best as possible.\n\nBut the next day, it was reported in the papers of Kansk that three different megacorporations had begun to carve up the formerly worker run factories, shops, and other facilities controlled by the Councils. Within the course of several weeks, the unions, once so powerful, started to accept their old places in the hierarchy of capitalism.

Before the Winter War and Barbarossa, before the fall of Moscow and the long march across the Urals.\n\nWhat a fucking joke!\n\nThe Army had been betrayed, self-sabotaged at every turn by politicians and secret police who had no idea what they were doing. Officers arrested for disobeying suicidal orders, NKVD flunkies second-guessing every move, men wasted in futile counter-attacks and reckless offensives. All headed by a man who seemed more interested in moving cities in Siberia then leading a nation at war.\n\nNow here he was, a remnant of another remnant of the Red Army. Rumors were going around that the Federation's armed forces were offering to take in anyone willing. Ultimately the decision of becoming a civilian in a foreign land or enlisting in an army not in service of a failed ideology was an easy choice to make."

Administering these new conquests have already become the subject of furious debate within the government, however.\n\nPresident Pokryshkin, unsurprisingly, advocates for a simple process of annexation into the Federation as a regular territory. This would further encourage the centralization of our authority, but some argue that the federally-administered territories are stretched thin enough as it is, and adding new lands on top of that would only compound our problems.\n\nThe influential mayor of Barnaul, Vasily Shukshin, has put forward a different proposal altogether. He believes it would be necessary to form a new republic within the Federation's borders: the Federal Republic of Tuva. Not only would this make integration a more painless affair, but would also go great lengths towards discouraging separatism.\n\nThe final say, of course, lies with the President..."

Sometimes, however, even his passions would prove frustrating, as Shukshin had spent the past hour and a half debating how to actually start this particular piece.\n\nLaying his pen aside, Shukshin sighed as he reached for his drink. Before his hands could even touch the glass, the phone rang and shattered the melancholy silence of his office. So much for that drink, he thought. \"Shukshin here. I hope you've got good news for me.\"\n\n\"It's Kerchenko. Your proposal about the Tuvan Republic? It went through.\"\n\nShukshin's eyes went wide. This was not the outcome he was expecting. \"Really? I'm surprised Pokryshkin let it happen. This is good news!\"\n\n\"Indeed. You should probably come down here and make an announcement before he takes all the credit.\"\n\n\"Very well, I'll see you soon, Kerchenko.\" Shukshin signed off as he placed the phone back.

The peoples of the Altay had come to appreciate what little autonomy they had been granted under the Soviet Union, and hoped that the democratic Novosibirsk government would continue this old policy.\n\nInstead, this minority group finds itself on the rocky road to full integration within the resurgent Russian behemoth.

Turning his attention away from the exercise and back towards his fellow squadmates, the private turned back into the conversation.\n\n\"-all these exercises?

Yet, as he watched soldiers march through Novosibirsk's streets, all he could feel was apprehension.\n\nPokryshkin meant well, that much was obvious, but he could see the divide between the two of them was growing with every passing day.

They say it's because I look like Tsar Nicholas, but it's not true, I swear!\n\nToday, I am here to discuss certain criticisms of the current rule of our country. Now now, I believe in free speech, but I believe that certain intellectuals are slandering our government, and by God I am going to come to its defense!\n\nThe first biggest slanderous lie is that our government is cynical. That is just a boldfaced lie. Our government is not cynical, it is pragmatic. You see, these famous philosophers, they make these funny little words up like 'cynical' and 'corporatization' in order to slander the Federation, but, let's be real here, when has a philosopher ever done something for you? Say what you want about the Federation, but it has brought numerous people out of poverty, brought economic development, and brought order. Sure, maybe they've been a little too heavy handed, but, hey, I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of my freedom for the sake of a better future.\n\nThe second, and the one I find the most offensive, is that our Federation is destined for failure, that we're too weak to get anything done. That is not only wrong, it is offensive, to the leaders and generals of this country, who have sacrificed countless man hours just to keep you and I safe from the hoards that lay behind our borders. We have a strong economy, strong leaders, and strong soldiers, who are going to be made even stronger by the first two.\n\nAnd the Federation will be made even stronger as the years go by, as economic development increases continually. According to some analysts, we may even become stronger than Germany when taking into account reunification and economic development.\n\nNow, to my fellow patriots, I leave you with a good little song that some of you may remember.

Of course, that seemed so much more quaint than the poverty of some after the collapse, but it was still painful.\n\nHe had crawled to the top of the air force, crawled from that slum and from those criminals and hoodlums to become one of the most famous airmen in Russia. And yet, it did nothing. The Germans came marching still, like the Huns of the West, crushing and butchering everything in their paths. He could still remember flying above a town, burnt to the ground, smoke filling the sky. All he could imagine then were the screams, and the flaying bodies.\n\nAnd now, he was the leader of a nation, a nation whose principles seemed so in line with his own. Liberation, freedom, decentralization. Far from the centralized nightmare that was the Soviet Union. And yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get it to work. The pieces wouldn't fit. He couldn't fit the square peg into the round hole.\n\nAnd so he compromised. A stronger office here, a stronger government there, until he realized that the ball of centralization kept going further and further. And now those principles, those principles he sacrificed so much for, had been ripped up.\n\nAnd, the worst part about it, was that he felt nothing. Pokryshkin felt like he should feel something, some sadness at the death of utopianism he had. But he didn't. The compromises, in his eyes, worked. Without them, he wouldn't be where he was. Without them, his people wouldn't be anywhere near as good as they are now.\n\nPerhaps, Pokryshkin thought, the principles of the Federation would be revived. Perhaps the government would give their constituent parts more say in their affairs, more trust in the people. But he doubted that. And so, he looked out the window, just as he did as a young man."

Barnaul was not nearly as important as the great city itself, of course, but it was important enough, and he was important enough within it, to be able to take some form of action.\n\nAnd that action had worked. He had been able, if only for a short while, to delay several measures focused on further increasing that degree of centralization. He knew he should have felt joy, or at least satisfaction, at such success. And yet, he did not, for he knew that though he had slowed the process, he had not, and would not be able to, halt it for very long.\n\nHis influence and popularity would allow him to do so for a while longer, but as he regarded the reports, all he could think about was how much time he had won.\n\nAnd how he knew it would not be much."

He had tired, of course, and it wasn't like he enjoyed working until the AM, but it was something that the man felt as if he had to do.\n\nShukshin's place in the administration of the Federation had placed him front and center in what passed for political machinations of the polity, resulting in his less-than-cynical ideas being the natural foil for his political counterpart, Pokryshkin. But as the documents bled together, the words and letters became increasingly incomprehensible in Shukshin's brain, out of the fog that permeated his mind came the deep worries that only ever emerged on the latest of nights.\n\nHis mind went to the origins of the Federation, and how it was originally based on freedom and liberty, but how the necessity of the Federation's system had resulted in an erosion of the Federation's basic principles, revealing corruption, apathy, and cynicism - unfortunately embodied by many of his political peers. He felt conflicted about his role in the state, and how it would, or wouldn't play out. He had once been a genuine democrat, convinced of the Federation's noble methods. But as the situation degraded, Shukshin could do nothing but wonder if his support of Pokryshkin and the Federation in general had been worth it. After no small deliberation, Shukshin spoke to himself, quietly, as if he wanted no one to hear despite the utter absence of company in his lonely office.\n\n\"I remember the struggle against tyranny.

 NOV_regional.3.desc: "Pokryshkin and Langemak, as well as numerous faceless accountants, corporate leaders, and other bean-counters, had gathered together around a great table of polished wood long ago liberated from the Soviet high command. \"Gentlemen,\" began Langemak, reading from a set of hastily scrawled notes that he clutched in his hands, \"we stand at a rare and opportune moment in history. Central Siberia now rightly belongs to us, and with Siberia comes her vast resources. Until now, we have lacked the infrastructure and heavy machinery to exploit them, but this has changed.\" Langemak paused for a moment, allowing himself a breath and for the information to sink into the brains of those assembled.\n\n\"With our hold over Central Siberia secured, we can now begin to collect what Mother Russia has seen fit to bless us with. Myself and President Pokryshkin have discussed at length a plan to see us all enriched, both the state and the corporations.\" swallowing, Langemak added, \"Mr. President, I yield the floor to you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, minister of economics,\" began Pokryshkin, \"Siberia is laden with petrol, natural gas, gold, diamonds, iron and coal. Billions, if not trillions, of rubles worth of resources lie beneath the earth. I do not wish to mince words, so here is my proposal: We, the government, will subsidize all mining and extraction operations in exchange for a percentage of the materials to be negotiated on an individual basis. Together, we will transform the Federation from just another warlord state into an economic juggernaut and profit in the process. All I ask from you is your help.\"\n\nIt was not long before voices were raised in a rousing affirmative."

 NOV_regional.4.desc: "Fyodor hastened to strap on his boots as the call was sounded. He was still exhausted from the drills of the previous day. His bones ached, his mind still fogged with sleep. The sergeant clanged a bell so loud it hurt Fyodor's ears. \"Move it, worms! You worthless sacks of shit aren't worthy of being in my beloved army! To the field! Now!\" Fyodor's old sergeant in Tomsk wasn't nearly as boisterous, preferring rousing speeches about the defense of democracy against the hordes of the wasteland. This army was different. This army knew it was the big dog in Siberia, and woe betide any who claimed otherwise. Offensive war versus defensive war, supposed Fyodor.\n\nThe men ran, performed live-fire drills, and sparred, all the while enduring the relentless abuse of the sergeant. Despite his former service in the army of Tomsk, Fyodor could have sworn the boot camp he was put through in that former nation was far less strenuous. In this new army, his body was hardened just as his mind was broken and reshaped into a soldier of the Federation.\n\nAs he lay exhausted in his cot that night, brain barely able to form coherent thoughts from the constant fatigue, he briefly pondered the irony that had led him here. Once a defender of democracy, Fyodor was now in service to... well, a slightly different form of democracy. He supposed he could live with that."

Prisoners of war that held officer rank within their now defunct militaries are requesting that we release them from prison and grant them commissions. Ordinarily, I wouldn't hesitate to refuse such a request, but I have seen it fit to pass their desires up to your office. The return of prisoners of war becomes a difficult proposition when the country they were captured form no longer exists. Additionally, these officers, including some of senior rank, could provide invaluable military expertise to our own armed forces.\n\nI have my own personal concerns with this request, as the pardoning of those responsible for waging war against our nation sets a dangerous standard. What we don't need is Narodniks claiming legal precedent for their own pardons. Naturally, the choice is yours, and I will be awaiting your reply.\n\nSigned,\n\nDmitry Glinka, Minister of Defense."

As you know-\"\n\n\"Yes yes, the backbones of our weapons and agricultural industries. I'm fully aware of what these corporations do around here.\"\n\n\"Al-Alright... Well then. The two corporations both desire different trading partners. Feniks supports diplomacy with the OFN and America. The United States has cutting edge technology and has no reason to fear that their supplies might be used against them They don't believe the Japanese would be nearly as willing to negotiate arms deals. Meanwhile, Sibir wants to trade primarily with the Sphere. They believe the Sphere can provide unique opportunities that America can simply never provide. This wouldn't be such a problem for our economy, if the two corporations weren't trying so hard to sway us to their side. They're bribing every politician they can get their hands on, and there are even some allegations that the two corporations are trying to sabotage each other. If this matter isn't resolved-\"\n\n\"Their stocks could fall, and bring our economy down with them,\" Pokryshkin could do nothing more than sigh.

Operating conditions within his factory, in terms of both safety and workload, had improved, and he found himself, at the end of the day, still possessing considerable energy. With the chance to relax. This was most unusual.\n\nIt also led to Grigory asking many questions. Why was this the case? Was the Federation's government truly committed to the reform that he had heard promised, and originally dismissed as yet another empty pledge? Were they temporary measures, intended only to placate the thousands upon thousands of workers who had risen in the Great Revolt? And, if so, how long would they last?\n\nFor a long while Grigory debated these questions within himself, until he realized, at long last, that the answer did not matter. Or that, if it did, it certainly didn't matter to him. No matter what it truly was, his workday had, quite simply, gotten both easier and safer.\n\nAnd that was good enough for him."

They had great hopes for the meeting, for no matter the political agenda they hoped to pursue, economic ties with an emerging power could not but be beneficial. Relations between Pokryshkin's state and America had been growing steadily for some time, and they would be cemented here today.\n\nThey had been told by their many advisors - from State, Treasury, and the Department of Defense - that the lands controlled from Novosibirsk offered almost limitless opportunity. For business. For travel. And, if they continued to grow in power and influence within the increasingly consolidated patchwork that was modern Russia, as a counterweight to the German and Japanese spheres of interest.\n\nThus, as Pokryshkin approached, surrounded by his entourage, the President strode forward, clapped his hand in theirs, and flashed a winning smile for the countless cameras that were closely watching.

With the victory of one over the others, a decision has been reached regarding external overtures. And one of those overtures is towards ourselves.\n\nIt has been proposed that our governments collaborate on a series of ventures, primarily related to military industries. Exchanges of materiel, the construction of munitions plants both in America and Siberia, and various other joint efforts have been proposed.\n\nWhile, of course, no concrete agreements have been reached at this time, several of our officials have encouraged further talks.

Those same industries have been quick to communicate the benefits for the state as well, beyond simple economic growth.\n\nSuch benefits could extend, but not be limited to, increased employment, expansion of national productive capacity, infusions of hard currency, additional foreign investment and construction, and much more besides.

The advantages of the new administration over the former, in terms of goods delivery, became an objective fact.\n\nThis then progressed to clear statements of the superiority of the Federation itself. Of course life was better now. Of course employment options were superior, in number and in opportunity. Of course the lands were safer and more secure for the average citizen. How could any aspect of existence not be more optimal?\n\nMost people claimed to their friends and neighbors that they ignored the obvious propaganda and, to some extent, they did.

Of course, no one would ever read it, and tragically, the journalist in question would have to be dealt with.\n\nLudmila had been undercover with the paper for months now, being as unassuming and by the books as possible. She had interacted with her co-workers just enough to avoid suspicion, just enough for them to open up to her. This was how the article detailing the Pokryshkin-backed corporate corruption and not so legal union-busting methods had come across her desk. Artyom was a good man, young and idealistic, ready to crusade against injustice with his typewriter and pen.\n\nPerhaps the greatest shame was dealing with the young crusader. Once the article had been destroyed, and Artyom had made a tragic point of telling Ludmila to be careful with it, as he had no copies, Ludmila would destroy him.

These same men and women who, only a short time ago, sang the old songs and praised Makhno and Kropotkin, now silently awaited entry into the capitalist machine.\n\nRoza felt tears well up in her eyes, remembering the way things used to be. She missed her red and black cap, her companions and the joy they shared together in building a future for all Russians. It wasn't supposed to be like this.\n\nWas the past so easily forgotten? Could she wake up day after day and pretend she wasn't an outspoken anarchist? That's when she locked eyes with him. Vavilov, once an organizer for the collective factories, stood in line, shame and a deadness permeating his gaze. The two anarchists had once been exceptional friends and companions in labor, but now here they were, staring at once another on the Kansk street.

It was a lie, the peace nothing but a symptom of what was to come. The air was calm, but it was charged, rippling with static. A storm loomed, and both Pokryshkin and Shushkin knew it even if the people did not. They secreted themselves away in their fortresses with their servants, plotting the downfall of the other. This new struggle would not be over land and resources, not some battle for dead Russia. Armies would not clash in the streets.

From anti-government screeds to suppressed poetry, all find themselves at home in the samizdat.\n\nYevgeny Kharitonov was just one such face of samizdat, laboring away at his typewriter, his fingers striking the keys with mechanical precision. It was the start of something new, something not quite ready yet, but shining with brilliant potential. \"The Enchanted Island\", he called it, a play he knew would not ever see mainstream publication. After all, no conservative regime would allow a homosexual to publish, regardless of the content.\n\nSo, here in the samizdat, Kharitonov wrote, hoping that the underground theater scene would find it pleasing. Perhaps in another decade, Kharitonov could walk as he was and publish what he pleased, but not today. He slid the platen back into place as it rang and continued to type."

They had formed into fine soldiers for whom producing criticism was difficult, but more importantly, a strong sense of camaraderie had formed among them, and where once they seemed close to apathetic about their roles within the military of the Federation, now they helped each other fulfill their respective eagerness with a sort of eagerness that Margelov hadn't seen in a long, long time. Given time, they stood a real chance of becoming the best soldiers Margelov had ever had the pleasure of working with.\n\nFor now, however, there was still work to be done, and so he returned to instruct them, trying to wipe the proud smile off his face and only partially succeeding.

Everything must have a purpose, a use to society, and pointless ceremonies like that did not.\n\nIt was ironic, Kabiskoy thought, that someone like him now governed what was once the last bastion of the old Central Siberian Republic, a realist in a city of idealists. Not that they would remain idealistic for long if he had any say in it, which he most certainly did. The clashing ideologies, the salons, the precious 'liberty' of the old Republic had been its greatest weaknesses, with the collapse being the inevitable result. The Federation had been founded on not repeating that mistake, and with his election as mayor, Kabiskoy would do everything in his power to make sure that it never would.

Deciding to make the best of it, Voznesensky had joined forces with Shukshin, and stood as the candidate of liberty in the latest Tomsk mayoral elections, ultimately proving triumphant through his ideals. Now, he would govern one of the most important cities of the Federation and aid Shukshin's cause further, in order to return to this great city a semblance of the freedom it had once enjoyed.\n\nEven as he waved to the crowd as he walked up the steps of the stage from which he would be inaugurated and then give his victory speech, he knew that this would be no easy task to accomplish.

They included provincial officials, workers' representatives, disaffected bureaucrats, activists of all types and, in several cases, old proponents of the fallen neo-Rurikids.\n\nThis gave them great numbers, yes, but as became increasingly evident, also made any form of unified action near impossible. Those protestors on the rightward edges of the spectrum argued and clashed with those on the left. Both despised the 'weakness' of those in the center. And those in the center reciprocated, refusing to pander to 'extremists' of any fashion.\n\nThe police had naturally been called out, and it had been the original intention of the government to disperse the protest. Violently if need be. But as the hours continued it became clear that such would not be needed. Arguments among the protestors turned into fistfights, and before long the protest collapsed entirely, dispersing soon after.

They promised peace and security for all, and that, should a good citizen have nothing to hide, they had nothing to fear.\n\nThe family watched this with great interest. The parents remembered well the chaos that had engulfed Central Siberia years hence, the visceral fear that 'others,' political, cultural, or otherwise, would engulf them, overrun them, and take from them the life they had worked so hard for. And, so, they were content. The Act promised security, and security was desired.\n\nThey knew they had nothing to fear. They were good citizens and they, of course, had nothing to hide."

Goodbye.\"\n\nAlexander Pokryshkin's anger betrayed his normally-cynical exterior, but the ex-aviator did not lash out - he rarely ever did. One of his many confidants sat across from Pokryshkin's desk, his hands tented. \"I can assume that Ivan was the bearer of bad news?\" The only response - a simple grimace - was enough to bring the confidant up to speed.\n\n\"I thought we had the numbers. I thought we had the names,\" Pokryshkin muttered as he stared out his window onto the bustling streets of Novosibirsk. His mind calculated his options busily. A distant memory from long ago - a piece of off-hand advice from a friend - floated into his consciousness. \"Never make a decision angry.\" Words Pokryshkin tried hard to live by. \"Barnaul's won this round of the game,\" Pokryshkin stated matter-of-factly, any trace of anger long gone. \"But their victory's still a fantasy. He might be getting more popular in the opposition circles, but that means nothing. There will be another battle, another war. And that time, we'll make sure that there's no winning for the bastard of Barnaul.\"\n\nHis confidant, with little to say, nodded succinctly. It was true - Shukshin's name was whispered from the peripheries of the Duma, it seemed more and more every day - but Pokryshkin was in control."

A slight smile betrayed the good news to his company - a good friend and political associate sat opposite him. Not a member of the Federation's Duma, per se, but a corporate liaison between Feniks and the government. A very good person to keep close, for both Pokryshkin and Feniks.\n\n\"I take it Ivan brings us good news?\" he asked, nearly rhetorically. Pokryshkin nodded.\n\n\"The motion passed. Not without a surprising amount of opposition, however. I'll have to have Ivan look into that. Apparently the name 'Vasily Shukshin' has become basically synonymous with some sort of misplaced democratic idealism.\"\n\nPokryshkin and his associate both chuckled. The former flying ace wore the small smile that Ivan helped paint for the rest of the day.

Harvest season was almost upon him and he could just about taste it in the wind as he watched his children running, care free, through acres of wheat, playing some game that only existed in their precious little minds. Konstantin let a smile creep across his face, remembering when he and his family were nothing but another group of battered refugees. But things are different now. Better. His children now smiled and laughed and will not have to worry about where their next meal would come from. That last fact was very apparent as Konstantin felt the tell tale scent of a cooking breakfast waft past his nose.\n\nThey'd come so far, and they'd done it all themselves. The blisters and cuts in their hands after clearing acres of brambles, the racket of hammers striking nails and saws biting through wood when they rebuilt the house where breakfast now sizzled in a pan, the soreness in his arms after working for hours sowing the fields... It was all worth it. For once, he felt like he belonged somewhere. This was where he was meant to be, not by grace of God but his own will. Konstantin had a home for his family, beautiful fields with their own bounty to harvest soon, and most of all he was able to watch his children play without a care in the world for the first time in ages."

Luka wished he believed his own words, but he couldn't. After the surrender, he found himself alone with Mikhail, Artyom, and three other scientists looking to him for guidance. He was prepared to work within a command structure and lead a small team on a single project, not make decisions for people that would shape the rest of their lives without any guidance. It wasn't what he wanted, it wasn't fair, and yet, here he was.\n\nThe worst part was the simplicity of the choice offered to them. They would work for Titan, or they would not work at all. The sheer injustice of it drove Luka to tears sometimes, but there was simply nothing else. Titan bought out everything. There was no other way. Something died in him every time he told himself that, but perhaps it was for the best. It made it easier to look at his team members in the eye when he spoke to them.\n\nLuka looked to the rest of his team while Mikhail stared out the window in contemplation. They sat quietly, the usual lively discourse dead and gone. No more theories, no more arguments, no more idealism. Instead, their eyes revealed the same image as in Luka's heart: a lonely flame in the dark, finally sputtering out.\n\n\"But... Without the Republic, what are we even working for anymore?\" Mikhail asked, desperation once again in his voice.\n\n\"The same thing we've always been working towards,\" Luka said, his lip twisting into a lifeless smile as he repeated the motto of his soon-to-be employer:"

It was a general overview on the situation in far eastern Siberia, and reading through it had dashed all traces of optimism he had felt about the region. It wasn't all bad, to be fair. Controlling the port town of Magadan finally gave them access to the sea, and with a little investment Irkutsk could become a major economic and industrial hub. But aside from a few scattered bright spots like those the report was nothing but bad news. The Far East had always been difficult to administer, even for a united Russian nation. Now he had to attempt the same task with far less resources than the Empire or the Union had been able to field. And on top of everything else, there was the main topic of the report: Partisans.\n\nBased on early reports alone Pokryshkin's security experts were telling him there were no less than eight organized radical terrorist organizations operating in the Far East, and possibly as many as a dozen. They came in all stripes. Fascists, communists, monarchists, anarchists, zealots, Cossacks, separatists, and more besides. The only reason they hadn't already collapsed the entire east into partisan warfare was because they spent as much time fighting each other as the central government. The report warned that might not be the case forever. The longer they are allowed to exist, the more likely it is that like-minded groups will form a common front against the newly formed Russian Federation. This cannot be allowed to happen.\n\nPokryshkin picked up the phone and started dialing the number. If consolidating Central Siberia had taught him anything, it was that there was only one way to deal with radicals. They were so wrapped up in their own meaningless theories and ideologies they barely even lived in the real world, and that made them too dangerous to tolerate. They would be dragged out of their holes and brought into the light where the people of Russia could see them for what they were: not brave partisans, but desperate terrorists with no place in the new Russia."

Their mission was a simple one, to root out elements of Yagoda's NKVD that had survived the strife in the Far East.\n\nAs they approached their target, he motioned for his men to split into two teams. His team would breach the front of the enemy structure, an abandoned apartment complex. The second team, under the command of Lieutenant Ugolev, would be tasked with breaching the rear entry and preventing the enemy from making a retreat. Ivan approached the doorway into the building unmolested and had his men stack up on the doors. His men entered the building and were met with an eerie silence. The men went about securing the first floor and found nothing, there was no sign this floor had been inhabited in years.\n\nIvan left three men behind in the lobby to act as a rearguard and pressed forward towards the stairwell. This would be the most dangerous part of the operation, traversing the stairwell into the second and third floors. He crept up the stairs slowly, keeping watch for any sort of traps. It was as he ascended the last step that he heard the gunfire from the base of the stairs. They had used the elevator shaft to get behind them.\n\nIvan began to shout out orders but was cut off as he had to dive for cover as soldiers on the second floor opened fire. He was only able to take rare potshots at his assailants. He was able to drop one before being hit in the shoulder. His rifle clattered from his grasp and fell down the stairwell. He cursed and drew his sidearm, only to be perforated by fire from a man on the stairs above him.\n\nIvan's body tumbled onto his men below.

Some may have sympathized with his cause - Sibir, and their backers - but Feniks, Titan, and the rest of them were venal, corrupt, heartless, ruled by a hundred would-be dictators. To hell with them. The supremacy of the corporations, the rise of the Siloviki, the bastardization of the Federation's ideals, those had been the final straws, the acts which made good people stand up and retake their destiny.\n\nAnd so he spoke. \"Fellow citizens, I have not come to begin a revolution. I have come to fulfill the ideals of which we have not forgotten!\"\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly.\n\nHe smiled, basking in the love of his fellow citizens. It would be a long, hard road, but President Shukshin knew he could make things right again."

 NOV_superregional.11.desc: "For what seemed like the hundredth time that day, Vasily Shukshin looked over the legislation crowding the President's- no, his desk. It was still hard to believe that the Presidency, for so long the preview of Pokryshkin and his ilk, was now in the hands of a peasant from Atlay, but he was here, and it was his.\n\nPicking up one of the many pages on his desk Shukshin looked over it once more, slowly flipping through its contents. Workers' protections, new regulations encompassing lobbying, and other vectors of corporate influence, stringent antitrust laws. It wouldn't be enough to defang the corporations, not by a long shot. Their influence reached far too deep for a mere piece of legislation to reverse the impact of a decade of unfettered exploitation, but it was a start.\n\nThe corporate giants, and Pokryhkin's clique, would fight them every step of the way. Their lackeys in the Duma, and the Siloviki who had long been paid off with corporate gold. Shukshin, however, had the will of the people - and the power of the Presidency - on his side."

 NOV_superregional.12.desc: "It was early in the morning when the two men met in one of the many rooms of the Presidential palace, flames flickering in the fireplace, snowmelt falling from the frost-covered roof. The new and former President of the Siberian Federation glancing at each other uneasily. They had been friends once, comrades in arms during the final days of the Republic. Those days were gone, a friendship strained and broken amidst the rise of the Federation.\n\n\"Where did it all go wrong Vasily? Where did we lose our way.\" Shukshin glanced up at Pokryshkin's voice, the Falcon of Siberia staring down into his drink. There was no malice in eyes, no resentment, just a colorless pallor, and a resigned expression.\n\nShukshin stared at his own drink, for he had no response. No answer to the question that he himself had pondered on many a sleepless night. He could still faintly remember the optimism in the Federation's early days, the final break from the decaying Republic amidst the chaos of the Siberian War and Anarchist Revolt. A time where the Federation seemed to have a place for everybody, regardless of ideology or wealth. Before the corruption and cynicism set in, before the rise of the Siloviki and the Corporations.\n\nHe could point to many a time where he or Pokryshkin should've stepped in, should've moved to reign in the excesses of the system. But, the Federation itself was a reaction, a result of the failed idealism of the poets and artists in Tomsk. Perhaps the cynicism which arose in idealism's place was simple yet another inevitable, another result of the Republic's failure.\n\nShukshin looked back up at his compatriot, the Falcon was waiting for an answer, and so he spoke the honest truth."

 NOV_superregional.13.desc: "President Pokryshkin sat behind his desk with a sense of satisfaction. Shukshin and his colleagues had failed. He had been confirmed as the President of the Federation against all of his detractors. The President smiled as he sipped on an aged brandy from his private stock.\n\nThe election had been the death knell of the Federalist cause. Shukshin had been ousted from his position, with his good friend Mikhail Devyatayev taking up the position once occupied by the bleeding heart mayor. With another drink he thought of his next moves. He would have to ensure that the Federalists were completely shut out of power. They would need to be replaced by men loyal to the cause of the Federation, strong men who would provide stability for the state. A return to business as usual was essential, as now that he had been confirmed he would need to consolidate the power of the executive.\n\nLooking out over the city, Alexander took another sip and leaned back in his chair. The election had ensured that the legitimacy of the silovik system had been cemented in the public consciousness. Indeed, the failure of the federalists was the best thing that could have happened for his regime.\n\nAlexander raised his glass to the window and gave a small toast to himself and the Federation."

Already seated were representatives of the big three corporations in the Federation. As he took his seat, he helped himself to the offered drink and practically ignored the other men at the table. When he was ready, he motioned for the men to begin the meeting. \"Thank you for joining us, Mr. President. We understand how busy your schedule is and appreciate this meeting,\" a well groomed man from Sibir began. After the usual pleasantries were observed, business began in earnest.\n\n\"Gentlemen, the Federation's recent acquisition of the Russian Far East has opened up to us a whole new area for profit. What the region lacks in population it more than makes up for in the sheer bounty of natural resources,\" Pokryshkin began.\n\n\"Indeed, the region has a vast potential for the expansion of our operations, and the profits therein. The question, I suppose, must be on the distribution of this vast material wealth. All of our companies have interest in the lands of the Far East, after all.\" The Sibir man glared at the representative from Titan as he spoke. In order to head off any argument, the President spoke.\n\n\"Gentlemen, as with all of our acquisitions, you shall have a say in the distribution of the land. So long as your financial departments can afford. I believe we shall first speak of the lands around the city of Irkutsk, as they are ripe for exploitation.\"\n\nThe meeting progressed as smoothly as previous meetings had, and by the end of it the President had made many profitable deals with the men, enough to ensure the economy of the Federation continued to flourish, at least."

Skyscrapers towered over the city, filled with the new ruling class of Russia: the Oligarchs, the overseers of his new Russia. This truly was the paradise for the Siloviks.\n\nHowever, as Alexander continued to stare from his office down below, he also saw those who benefited the least from his system. Ragged workers walked to and fro towards the factories on the outskirts of the city. Those unemployed could be seen laying about in the streets, begging for money only to be cleared out by the police and forced to go somewhere else other than the upper districts. Memories of Shukshin's cries for a fair and just Russia filled Alexander's mind, which only made him chuckle. That man was a shell, a broken man forced back to the bottle he hated so much, for Shukshin and his posse had failed to realize one, singular truth about Russia.\n\nRussia was a harsh nation, and it needed to a strongman to bring it to progress and modernity.\n\nAnd Russia needed to be strong and stable for what was to come. The Germans still had their steely grip on Moscow and Russians suffered under them. They deserved to be a part of Russia, for they are true born Russians, not colonial subjects of a regime of a foreign nation. He would receive what belonged to the Federation back no matter what, no matter the cost.\n\nThe machine of Russia had been broken time and time again, but he had fixed the machine. Now, he orchestrated a symphony of machines, working together for his grand designs for his nation. He couldn't help but smile as he sat down once again in his chair, and toasted the victory to come."

They were cleaner now, thanks to new regulations, and he could see several families picnicking along the river's banks.\n\nShukshin allowed himself a small drink as he took in the sight, remembering his excursion to the waterfront nearly a decade ago. Unchecked corporate excess and institutional corruption, a government-run by and for local strongmen. He had changed all that; no longer did corporate greed dictate policy and law, no longer were the working class squeezed for every penny. There was still much to be done, of course, fairer regulations, the issue of Pokryshkin's clique, increased federalization, and the ever-pressing matter of the hated Germans.\n\nYet, as he saw workers joking around in the fields just beyond the river and families enjoying a vacation for the first time in years, Shukshin felt something stir inside of him. The idealism which was once so infectious in the early days of the Central Siberian Republic. He was doing this for them, for the people, for Russia, all of Russia, not just those born into power, those blessed by circumstance. He remembered those days, the headiness and optimism, and how everything fell apart under the strain of the Siberian War, and the fighting against the anarchists, the food riots, the shootings.\n\nHe poured himself another drink as the morning sun rose high in the sky. The CSR may have fallen under the strain of war, but the Federation-his Federation-was different, stronger, and more robust, yet no less concerned for the welfare of its citizens.\n\nIt was different than the CSR. It had to be."

Already he had drained seven glasses just like it and there was little indication that he would sober up anytime soon. His sobriety had been a personal point of pride for him once, when the drink had nearly consumed him. Now though, with his pride tarnished and hopes crushed before him, he relished the old feeling of drunkenness.\n\nHe had been so close. The elections were his chance to bring some semblance of justice and freedom to a system so abused by the Siloviks. And in the end it had all been for nothing. The deals and promises made to rally support, the hopes and dreams inspired in the people of the Federation were turned to ash with the solidification of Pokryshkin's victory.\n\nThe bastard had been quick to remove him from his position, to neuter any hope that he might use his power for the benefit of the people. Instead, one of the President's lackeys held his position to be a yes man for the Silovik regime. It sickened him, the whole rotten situation made him want to puke. The idea that everything he had done throughout his career, for the good of his people, would be wiped away by that smug bastard in Novosibirsk. Vasily clenched his eyes shut as tears threatened to break free.\n\nHis resistance was futile in the end as Vasily Shukshin, last hope for the freedom of the people of the Federation sobbed drunkenly in his kitchen.

Additional issues with the bomb deployment mechanism made accurate targeting highly difficult.\n\nDespite the multitude of problems that have rendered the M-50 an unusable design, our engineers have managed to salvage some of the more innovative ideas incorporated into the prototype. The tests proved that the concept of high-altitude strategic bombing is both possible and achievable with an improved design, and with better engines it should be possible to produce a strategic bomber that is capable of achieving high speeds without issue.

In the end, after months of stress and work by dozens of engineers and designers, the project had spent almost twice its original budget before a prototype was completed and ready to fly. It would all be worth it as long as the test was successful.\n\nAs the bomber climbed into the sky the men collected in the control tower watched nervously. The pilot read off readings at predetermined intervals, rattling off his air speed, temperature inside the cabin, fuel burn rate, and more. Everything seemed to be going well. One engineer breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThe left wing started to visibly wobble. The pilot reported the plane was beginning to turn and shake outside of his control. The captain in the control tower grabbed the microphone and began to rattle off instructions when they all watched the wing tear off completely. The pilot ejected; a black speck held aloft by a white piece of canvas.

To offset this disadvantage, it is heavily armored, leading some of the test pilots to dub it \"the flying tank\". As opposed to the rapid strike tactics of most attack helicopters, the Mi-24's pilots have been encouraged to adopt a new strategy of aggressive, prolonged engagements with ground forces, relying on their heavy weaponry to mow down enemy soldiers and vehicles alike while their armor soaks up any incoming fire."

 NOV_elections.0.desc: "As the elections for the Federation ramp up, it's become clear that despite Alexander Pokryshkin's prior political ascendancy, that he's been challenged to that very ascendancy by none other than Vasily Shukshin, the mayor of Barnaul.\n\nBoth men occupy highly prestigious and very important positions within the Federation, but over the years have come to represent two very different currents of thought in regards to the Federation itself. Alexander Pokryshkin, the man that \"saved the Federation from itself\" and engineered its highly successful ascent, has campaigned on a platform of economic expansion, national stability, and measured patriotism.\n\nVasily Shukshin, on the other hand, represents the opposition to Pokryshkin's monopoly on power. Comprised of locals from Barnaul, supporters of a liberal democratic federation, and dissenters-turned-traitors from Pokryshkin's camp, Shukshin's platform is focused around political reform and an emphasis of a return to the roots - culturally and politically - especially in regards to remembering the origin of the Federation and a distaste for tyranny.\n\nAs each respective political player begins their campaign, only time will tell which of the two will come out on top."

 NOV_elections.1.desc: "Vasily Shukshin was many things, a writer, actor, and poet, a Mayor, and politician. He had climbed his way from the son of peasants in Altay to become the second most powerful man in the Federation, the champion of democracy.\n\nHowever, as he sat at home, waiting for the results to come in, all he could feel was trepidation. Months worth of campaigning, dozens of speeches, rallies, and meetings; weeks of courting corporate representatives and sympathetic siloviki had led to this. He had crisscrossed Siberia, from Magadan to Kolpashevo, and now the only thing he could do was wait.\n\nShukshin stared at the bottle of vodka on his desk, resisting the temptation to pour himself a drink. Pokyrshkin and his allies would use every trick in the book to keep themselves in power, and all he could do was hope that the will of the people would be enough.\n\n--------------\n\nThe tallys came in agonizingly slowly, Shukshin's heart soaring at every positive result and sinking with every poor showing, but they were clear. Putting the bottle aside, Shukshin made preparations to move to Novosibirsk.\n\nThe people had spoken, and they wanted Pokryshkin out."
 NOV_elections.1.a: "Democracy breathes."
 NOV_elections.2.t: "The Outcome"
 NOV_elections.2.desc: "The dawn rose over Siberia as its people awoke from their slumber. The farmer, the worker, the housewife, they all knew what this morning meant. For months, the fate of the Siberian Federation had hung in the balance as the federation's current leader, the corporate status quo President Alexander Pokryshkin, has faced off against a challenge by the former mayor of Barnaul, the democratic Vasily Shukshin. They had dueled in the streets, in the farms, in the barracks, in the very hearts and minds of the people. Everyone knew that whoever won this election, it would determine if the Federation remained in its corporate state status quo or if the Federation would turn a new corner into democracy, a concept the Federation lay unfamiliar with.\n\nAnd so, as they gathered around their radios, bought the morning newspapers and even gathered around the few TVs dotted about the country, they waited with bated breath to hear what would happen to their homeland. Every man, woman, and child sat with baited breath as the newscaster began to speak.\n\n\"Hello citizens of the Siberian Federation, this is Nikolai Potemkin of Siberian News Now! Today, I am proud to announce that the winner of yesterday's election and the leader of our glorious Federation is...,\"\n\n\"President Alexander Pokryshkin!\"\n\nSilence filled the homes and crowds of the Federation. Only a scant few in the government and the higher echelons of the companies partied at the news. The people knew what this meant: same old same old, and so, the Siberian Federation would remain the brutal, cynical, corporate state that it always had been, for on this day..."
 NOV_elections.2.a: "The people of Siberia had shrugged in indifference to their world."
 NOV_elections.3.t: "A Meeting with the Military."
 NOV_elections.3.desc: "Amet-khan Sultan was surprised by the size of Vasily Shukshin's office. He had imagined the man challenging Pokryshkin for the presidency of the Federation would have a corner office with large windows framing an impressive desk, and rows of file cabinets and bookshelves along the walls. Shukshin's workplace was not that. It was not quite a walk-in closet, but it wasn't far off. Shukshin noticed the military man looking around with a puzzled expression and chuckled.\n\n\"I know it isn't much, but when you're challenging the incumbent President from within his own government, it isn't a surprise when your accommodations get suddenly downgraded.\"\n\nSultan nodded. \"My current office has a nice view of the river. I suppose I shouldn't get too attached to it in case this meeting becomes public knowledge.\"\n\nShukshin grinned and nodded. \"Speaking of, I have another meeting in a few minutes so let's get down to business. I don't want you to risk that view for nothing.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Sultan said, holding out a file he'd held under his arm. \"This is a list of officers in the military that I believe might be sympathetic to our cause. Take a look and let me know who you want me to contact.\"\n\nShukshin opened the file and glanced over the list of names. \"Do you trust these men?\" he asked.\n\nSultan hesitated before he spoke. \"They are all talented and loyal to the Federation. Some I trust more than others, which I mention in the file, but I think all of them are at least potentially persuadable.\"\n\nShukshin nodded. \"Very good. That's all for now, I'll get back to you tomorrow with a list of who I want to contact first.\"\n\nSultan turned to walk out of the tiny office. There was work to be done."
 NOV_elections.3.a: "Time to find out where the military stands."
 NOV_elections.31.t: "Expanding the Coalition"
 NOV_elections.31.desc: "When Shukshin opened the door to Amet-Khan Sultan's office he found the former ace staring out the window that overlooked the river. Wordlessly, Shukshin walked over to stand beside him. Both men stared out over the winding waterway for a few seconds before Sultan spoke.\n\n\"I really will miss this view. I've spent many hours taking it in, thinking about anything or nothing. At least the sacrifice shall not have been in vain.\"\n\nShukshin glanced over at him, curiously.\n\nSultan continued. \"I've found fifteen other officers who are willing to endorse you publicly. Most are from the army but a few are from the air force and we even got one promising candidate from the naval academy. Now eight of them, including the ones from the air force, are only willing to endorse as a group. Strength in numbers I suppose, but an endorsement is an endorsement. This should be enough to show the people that the military isn't one hundred percent behind Pokryshkin, and it'll help with you being criticized for being too weak on foreign policy.\"\n\nShukshin grinned. \"Fifteen,\" he murmured. \"I thought we'd be lucky to get ten.\"\n\n\"The army is tired of playing second fiddle to the air force,\" Sultan replied \"And the air force wants to hedge its bets in case you win.\"\n\nShukshin nodded. \"Thank you, Amet-Khan. You've done better than I ever could have hoped. If I win you can have whatever office you'd like.\"\n\nSultan turned his eyes back to the river, a small smile on his face."
 NOV_elections.31.a: "\"This one will do just fine, sir.\""
 NOV_elections.32.t: "Progress Rebuked"
 NOV_elections.32.desc: "Shukshin waited for the phone on his desk to ring. He had been waiting for half an hour, performing meaningless tasks to keep himself occupied while his eyes continued to drift over to the phone. It had been a long day, and a long night too, but the phone call he was waiting for would determine whether he went to bed pleased or disappointed. He had ruled out going to sleep before the call. Even if it wasn't unprofessional, his nerves would not have let him.\n\nSuddenly the phone clattered to life, and despite the long wait it still caught Shukshin by surprise. He hurriedly picked it up and said one word. \"Sultan.\"\n\n\"Mr Shukshin,\" Amet-khan Sultan replied from the other end. \"I apologize for the delay. I was trying to work something out at the last minute before I called.\" His tone was professional, but there was a hint of disappointment in his voice it couldn't fully cover.\n\n\"I take it you didn't get anyone then,\" Shukshin sighed.\n\n\"Worse, I got an influential army captain by the name of Pokroskov. He and several of his comrades were ready to endorse you, but he made too much noise and was found out. He was discharged and replaced within the hour and now no one will even speak to me, not if it puts their careers on the line.\"\n\nShukshin couldn't hold back the long sigh that followed. \"That's... disappointing. Thank you for your efforts Sultan, I know you did your best and things got out of hand.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that, sir,\" Sultan replied, \"I will keep trying and I am still willing to endorse you, but I'd advise your future campaign strategies not rely on any support from the military. Good night.\"\n\nThe line went dead. Shukshin put the phone back where it sat and rubbed his temples."
 NOV_elections.32.a: "He did not sleep well that night."
 NOV_elections.4.t: "The Barnaul Rally"
 NOV_elections.4.desc: "On a normal night, the Barnaul Theater would be hosting a local musician or an amateur dramatic company debuting a new production, and it would draw a decent audience of the residents of the city whose name the theater bore. But this was no normal night. The main event was not scheduled to start for two more hours and there were already lines around the block. As soon as the doors opened people excitedly filed in, taking any seat they could find. Within half an hour of opening its doors, the Barnaul had to close them again. For the first time in decades, every seat in the house was full. Even the standing room in the back was packed solid.\n\nThe excited chattering of the audience suddenly quieted as the lights winked, then dimmed, a sign that things were about to begin. From backstage Vasily Shukshin took one last deep breath, patted the speech in his pocket, and walked out into the light. The silent theater immediately roared back to life, all 2,500 people there clapping and cheering for him before he'd even said a word. As he took the podium, he couldn't help but grin like an idiot. \"Thank you, Barnaul!\" he said, the speakers allowing him to make himself heard over the clamor.\n\nThe speech was supposed to last thirty minutes but with the audience cheering and chanting it stretched to almost an hour. Additional speakers outside the theater delivered Shukshin's words to the even larger crowd outside on the streets. The next morning the headline in every major newspaper in the Federation was about Shukshin's rally. Most touted it as a huge victory, a massive sign of enthusiasm for the opposition candidate. Even papers loyal to Pokryshkin couldn't help but acknowledge that the rally had been a success for his opponent."
 NOV_elections.4.a: "We will need a bigger venue next time!"
 NOV_elections.5.t: "Dirty Work"
 NOV_elections.5.desc: "Dmitry Glinka read over the memo he'd just received. It came straight from Pokryshkin, and stamped across the top in bold red letters were the words TOP SECRET. Very subtle, Glinka thought to himself. He'd been expecting this memo, or one like it, for quite a while. Pokryshkin was in a reelection campaign and according to the polls it was closer than anyone suspected it could have been at the start of the race. If the boss wanted to be certain of victory, he would have to stop playing nice and get down in the mud, or at least send someone in for him. It seemed that responsibility had fallen on the SB. It made sense that it would. After all, dirty work was what they did best.\n\nGlinka was surprised by the plain wording of the letter. He was used to politicians beating around the bush and trying to maintain a degree of plausible deniability when asking for his help. Pokryshkin had made no such effort here, meaning he was either braver, dumber, or more desperate that Glika had assumed. The order said plainly that the SB was to investigate the leading figures of the opposition and find any secrets from their past they might be trying to conceal from voters. Even more plainly, it said that if the SB could not find sufficient evidence of any scandals, it was authorized to fabricate some in order to \"preserve the stability of the Federation.\"\n\nGlinka chuckled. He'd already dug into Shukshin and most of his cronies, and they were all as clean as a whistle. If only he'd been working for them, he would have had no trouble at all bringing Pokryshkin's corruption to light, but that was not the way things had worked out, was it? The President was the one who paid him, and it was time to earn his keep. Shukshin was running to the left of Pokryshkin on several major issues. That was as good a place to start as any."
 NOV_elections.5.a: "Perhaps his campaign has been infiltrated by communist agitators?"
 NOV_elections.51.t: "Truth is Relative"
 NOV_elections.51.desc: "SHUKSHIN ACCUSED OF WORKING WITH COMMUNIST AGENTS!\n\nA NEW RED MENACE FOR RUSSIA?\n\nOPPOSITION CAMPAIGN MANAGER ARRESTED!\n\nIgor looked over the newspapers, trying to decide which one he wanted. He usually preferred the Morning Post, but recently it had appointed a new editor and had been slowly becoming a mouthpiece for Pokryshkin's government. Not that that mattered today. Every paper, even the ones that were usually anti-government, was carrying a story about Shukshin speaking to some socialist labor leaders last week or about his campaign manager benign arrested yesterday. Igor was already caught up on the communist story so he grabbed the paper with the article on the campaign manager, paid the vendor, and took a seat at a bench.\n\nThe article detailed the arrest and charging of the campaign manager. Apparently, he'd been caught involved in some corrupt dealings trying to rig vote collection in a precinct near Tomsk. He'd already been released on bail but his trial was scheduled for only a week before an election and the newspaper speculated that he would probably be replaced in the coming days. Shukshin, for his part, denied all of the charges and accused the government of fabricating the evidence to disrupt his election bid. Igor was surprised by that. Sure, everyone knew the government was corrupt, but it wouldn't go as far as to just make up evidence would it?\n\nIgor put the paper away and sighed. He didn't normally follow politics, but he had recently. He used to think every politician was just a corrupt, dishonest man looking to make his money off the work of the common people, but Shukshin had made him reconsider that belief. He'd sounded like he genuinely wanted to help in his speeches and writings, but it seemed that he and his allies were just as deceitful as the people in charge right now. If that was the case, Igor thought, he would probably just not bother voting this time either. If nothing would change, what was the point?"
 NOV_elections.51.a: "Nihilism is the death of democracy."
 NOV_elections.52.t: "Caught Red Handed"
 NOV_elections.52.desc: "PRESIDENT ORDERED FRAMING OF SHUKSHIN!\n\nSB CAUGHT STIRRING UP RED SCARE!\n\nPOKRYSHKIN DENIES ALL INVOLVEMENT!\n\nIgor looked over the headlines, considering which paper he wanted. Not that it mattered, they were all telling the same story, the only story anyone was talking about today. A memo supposedly written by President Pokryshkin to the head of the SB had been leaked. No one but the leaker knew how it got out, but now the front page of every newspaper bore the same picture of a note with the words TOP SECRET printed atop it in bright red and bearing the President's signature at the bottom. The contents of the letter were brief but clear. The SB was ordered to go digging into the past of Shukshin and his associates looking for scandals, and to make some up if they couldn't find any real ones.\n\nIgor picked a paper he knew had a cartoonist he liked and settled in to read further. Shukshin was accusing the President of corrupt and tyrannical behavior, and was calling on the people of the Federation to turn out and vote to reject this sort of treatment. Pokryshkin, for his part, was denying everything and dismissed the story as a hoax by the opposition to portray him as a dictator. He had refused to comment on the fact that the signature on the letter matched his perfectly, and it appeared to have been printed on notarized paper from his office.\n\nIgor felt himself getting angrier and angrier as he read the story. He'd known Pokryshkin was corrupt, but he never thought he'd stoop as low as trying to frame his opponent. Igor was not normally a political man. He considered most politicians to be liars and thieves regardless of party or position, but the President had gone too far this time. Igor had heard some of Shukshin's speeches, and he'd been interested but he hadn't made up his mind until now. The election was coming soon, and when it arrived, he'd be sure to cast his ballot for the man that deserved to lead Russia, not the one leading it now"
