 USA_lbj_64_the_johnson_presidency: "ジョンソン政権"
 USA_lbj_64_the_johnson_presidency_desc: "予備選挙から本選挙まで、1年以上にわたる厳しい選挙戦を経て、リンドン・ベインズ・ジョンソンは大統領執務室に座っている。「偉大な社会」という大胆な主張を掲げて、彼は手段を選ばずにアメリカを作り替えようと目論んでいる。包括的な公民権法、すべての人のためのメディケア、国民の極貧状態の終焉。これらの計画された改革は、ケネディの進歩主義の灯火の継続を表しており、まさに国の構造を変えるものである。加えてジョンソンは、軍隊を改善し、現代社会に相応しい戦闘マシーンに改革するとも主張している。\n\nしかし、彼はアメリカ社会の構造を作り替えるために計画した一連の改革を始める前に、国民からの信頼を得なければならない。就任演説にて、ジョンソンは自分の計画とその未来について、国中にしっかりと伝えるだろう。"
 USA_lbj_64_mistakes_of_nixon: "ニクソンの失敗"
 USA_lbj_64_mistakes_of_nixon_desc: "ニクソン大統領政権は、悲惨としか言い表せないものであった。彼の任期の間に、南アフリカ戦争の勃発、市民権問題の台頭、そして合衆国の短い歴史の中でも最悪のスキャンダル問題が起こったのだ。彼の任期中の辞任後、後を引き継いだジョン・Ｆ・ケネディも暗殺された。もしジョンソンが民衆から彼個人だけでなく、共和民主連合に対する信頼も取り戻そうとするのならば、彼は国民に対しこれらの問題の解決を確約しなければならない。国外紛争における勝利、人種間の完全な平等の達成、そして汚職やスキャンダルが起こらないという確約だ。"
 USA_lbj_64_legacy_of_kennedy: "ケネディの遺産"
 USA_lbj_64_legacy_of_kennedy_desc: "ケネディ大統領の任期は、不幸にも短期間で終わったが、恐らく共和民主連合があり得る最高の状態を象徴していた。彼の少なく、短い、楽観主義的な日々は、RDCだけでなく、アメリカ全体の将来を決定する最も重要な月日であったかもしれない。ニクソンの過ちを戒めるように、RDCが現状で生き残るには、ケネディの遺産も継がなければならない。ジョンソン大統領は、アメリカがもう一度完全になるまでは、進歩主義と団結というケネディの灯火を引き継ぐだろう。"
 USA_lbj_64_forwards_together: "共に前へ"
 USA_lbj_64_forwards_together_desc: "今こそ、共に前へ進む時だ！過去数十年の苦痛と、国民が政府に抱く汚辱と不信は、もう終わりにしなければならない。この国はより国民を保護せねばならず、そのためには、全てのアメリカ人を助け、この国をより大きな社会へと結束させるような計画を生み出す努力をしなければならない。大きな社会とは、あらゆる階層、あらゆる肌の色、あらゆる信念を持つアメリカ人を助け、彼らが、必ずしもコントロールできないような状況のために苦しむことがないものだ。さあ、前進だ！"
 USA_lbj_64_secure_congress_support: "米国議会の支持を得る"
 USA_lbj_64_secure_congress_support_desc: "我々の偉大な社会計画を成立するためには、議会が必要だ。この巨大な法案を大統領の机に届けるには、下院と上院での票を確かなものにしなければならない。その票を確保するための戦略を練ろうではないか。優柔不断な味方を投票に向かわせるために、我が党の公権力を利用することもできるし、この法案を可決させるために、NPPの穏健派議員と取引することもできる。いずれにせよ、勝利のために必要な支援を確保しよう。"
 USA_lbj_64_on_our_own: "我々自身で"
 USA_lbj_64_on_our_own_desc: "我々は議会で過半数を占めている。この事実を利用しようではないか！党を煽り立てる必要がある。妥協的な利益誘導をを見つけられれば、法案に味方する穏健派議員も増えるであろう。偉大な社会法案が可決されれば南部での支持を失う可能性が高いが、真の改革をもたらすには必要なことだ。良い知らせとして、我が党が団結して障害に立ち向かえる限り、NPPはこの法案を止めることはできないだろう。悪い知らせとして、この法案を可決するために議会の過半数を確保した後、NPPは保守的な有権者を取り込めるだろう。"
 USA_lbj_64_deal_with_center: "中道派との取引"
 USA_lbj_64_shut_up_and_help_me: "良きアメリカのために"
 USA_lbj_64_shut_up_and_help_me_desc: "共和党派、民主党派、野党のNPPまで、できる限りの人を集めて協力してもらっている。もし我らが皆、アメリカを良くするために働いているのなら、より良い教育、貧困の削減、医療の改善、そして我らの国に自由を確保することに、全員が加わるべきだ。我々は議会で訴えた－－今、彼らはアメリカのために、この計画に加わらねばならないのである！"
 USA_lbj_64_lay_groundwork: "根回し"
 USA_lbj_64_lay_groundwork_desc: "Policy analysts, researchers, economists, and public administrators who have had experience in running domestic programs will be needed in order to prepare the greatest reform in American history. We must gather all of them to start hammering out the policy alongside the various political committees working in Congress. Let us make sure we have a bill worth fighting for!"
 USA_lbj_64_introduce_concept: "概念の導入"
 USA_lbj_64_introduce_concept_desc: "次に、我々は偉大な社会法案の理念を国民に伝え始めなければならない。我々の理想目標は、全アメリカ人にとってより公平な国になるよう改革することであると伝えねばならない。我々は、全アメリカ人がより豊かに、より幸せに、より自由に暮らせるようになることを理想としていることを、示さなければならない。我々の説明は、まず主要大学から始まり、それから主要都市で始まり、そして大規模な会場で、聴衆が我々の偉大な社会法案に興奮する形で行われる。国民の支持率を上げるには、国民をワクワクさせなければならないのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_form_task_forces: "タスクフォースの編成"
 USA_lbj_64_form_task_forces_desc: "アメリカ社会全体を詳細に調べなければならない。教育、貧困、インフラ、医療、福祉、芸術など、あらゆる面に目を通す必要がある。また、それらを比較検討し、現在の予算と計画を組合わせて調整する。これらのデータをもとにして、最終的に偉大な社会法案を完成させるのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_the_great_society: "偉大な社会"
 USA_lbj_64_the_great_society_desc: "我が同胞たるアメリカ人よ、私は諸君らの大統領として、新たなる時代の幕開けを宣言したい。偉大な国の座から転落してからの過去30年間は、アメリカが国民と世界に曝け出した弱さに失望し続ける日々だった。この数年、アメリカ人はますます貧しくなり、病にかかり、飢え、怒り、そして、アメリカ国民の繁栄に失敗し続ける政府に困惑した。鉤十字という外国からの脅威があったことでさえも、前政権の怠惰の理由にはならない。だが、過去に苦難があったとしても、今日は違う日だ。今日は、アメリカ社会における新たな1日である。より多くのアメリカ人が貧困の苦しみから抜け出し、自由と解放をより確かなものにするために労働に加わることができる日である。将来の健康と娯楽のために提供される医療保険によって、病苦の心配が和らぐ日である。この国のすべての人々が幸福を追求することができる日である。総合的に、アメリカ国民は偉大な社会法案の署名によって、永遠の繁栄を享受することが可能になるのだ。我々の偉大な社会計画は、アメリカ人一人一人の生活を向上させ、欲求を確実に満たすものになるであろう。\n-リンドン・B・ジョンソン大統領"
 USA_lbj_64_more_civil_rights: "公民権の拡大"
 USA_lbj_64_more_civil_rights_desc: "今こそ、長い間迫害を受けてきた同胞であるアメリカ人に注目する時だろう。黒人達に不幸をもたらしている憎むべき集団は、もし我が国に敵が攻めてきた時、奴らと足並みを揃えようとするはずだ。だから我々は、黒人のために慎重に戦う準備をしなければならない。過激派と戦うために、アフリカ系アメリカ人はあらゆる面で自由でなければならず、そのために我々は、彼らを何としても自由になれるようにするのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_vote_in_hand: "票を投じる"
 USA_lbj_64_vote_in_hand_desc: "NPPの過激主義に直面しても、我らが党の成功を確実なものにしたいのならば、我々はアフリカ系アメリカ人コミュニティがあらゆる選挙で投票できるよう、支援しなければならない。南部の州の多くでは、アフリカ系アメリカ人が選挙権を行使するのを防ぐため、筆記テストや人頭税、さらには集団リンチに至るまで、未だにできる限りの手段を尽くしている。この抑圧の犯罪に終止符を打つべきだ。党がアフリカ系アメリカ人を支援すれば、彼らは喜び、将来の選挙では共和民主連合に忠誠心を示すだろう。"
 USA_lbj_64_outlaw_literacy_tests: "筆記テストを廃止"
 USA_lbj_64_outlaw_literacy_tests_desc: "1890年代から行われきた筆記テストは、アフリカ系アメリカ人が投票できないようにするという複数の州政府からの望みのために、憲法を全て暗唱させ、南部の貧しい白人でさえ読むことを要求されなかった偉大な古典を読ませたりした。アメリカ国民にとって、誰に投票するかを決めるために文字を読めることは重要であるが、この慣習全てが、南部のアフリカ系アメリカ人の権利を剥奪し、アメリカ人の生活様式を破壊しようとする過激派の票を確保し続けるためだけに利用されてきたのだ。こうしたテストを明確に禁止する条項を法案に書き込もう。"
 USA_lbj_64_special_provisions: "「特別条項」の定義"
 USA_lbj_64_special_provisions_desc: "投票権法の法案には、南部諸州がアフリカ系アメリカ人の投票権を剥奪し、阻止するような投票法の変更を可決できないようにするため、幾つかの条項が含まれるかもしれない。これらの州では、投票法の変更に連邦政府の承認が必要となる。これは共和民主連合への黒人票を多く獲得することになるであろうが、党に忠実な民主党の仲間の一部にとっては不都合なことになるだろう。特別条項を設けると、共和民主連合に投票する南部の白人が激怒して、NPPに鞍替えする可能性が高いのだ。黒人票を確保する一方で、南部での支持基盤を失うのか。選択するのは我々だ。"
 USA_lbj_64_voting_rights_act: "投票権法"
 USA_lbj_64_voting_rights_act_desc: "投票権法が可決する準備が整った！この法案は、より多くのアメリカ国民を法的な抑圧から解放する画期的なものとなるであろう。我々の法案は、白人やあらゆる肌の色を含む人種的少数派を含む、すべてのアメリカ人の投票権を保護するのだ。識字テスト、投票税、様々な罰則条項など、選挙過程における差別的な人種差別は撤廃されることになるだろう。南部の多くの白人は立腹するだろうが、我々は前身し、我々はより強きまとまりとなり、そしてその結果、より強く、より良い国民となるのだ。多数の州が抵抗するだろうが、連邦法に服従するようになるだろう。我らの国は人種差別や偏見に直面しても揺らぐことはないし、我々は国を確固たるものにするであろう！全ての人のより良い未来のために！"
 USA_lbj_64_once_more_unto_the_breach: "またしても違反"
 USA_lbj_64_once_more_unto_the_breach_desc: "南部の企業や公共施設は、新たな法に従うであろう。連邦政府の「抑圧」だといくら泣き叫ぼうが、黒人をはじめとする社会的少数者が、必要な買い物をする企業や、日常生活で必要な支援を受けるための公共施設を利用できなくなることはないだろう。私は連邦政府の監視員を派遣し、必要とあれば、州兵を派遣して法を執行する。このような州に対して、断固とした態度で臨むべき時が来たのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_beacon_in_darkness: "暗闇の中の光"
 USA_lbj_64_beacon_in_darkness_desc: "我らの国は、ファシズムやナチズムの抑圧からの自由を望む群衆のための光となるべきだ。往々にして奴隷となったり殺されてしまう見捨てられた者達を、救わねばならないのだ！現在の移民制度における制限を緩和し、移民が入国して労働するのを容易にする必要がある。だが、そのプロセスが混乱して国に害を及ばすことがないよう、実行は慎重にせねばならない。門戸を開けば多くの人が助かるかもしれないが、ナチスのスパイの潜入も容易になってしまうかもしれない。逆に、過剰に制限をかければ、大勢を遠ざけてしまうかもしれない。正しい解決策を選ぼう。"
 USA_lbj_64_reshuffle_police_forces: "警察組織の再編成"
 USA_lbj_64_reshuffle_police_forces_desc: "南部で諸問題を引き起こしてきた州警察及び地方警察は、連邦法と新たな州法の施行を確実にされるようにする。過去に行われた法律の無視や、地元警察と州警察によるアフリカ系アメリカ人に対する残虐行為の助長は、完全に犯罪である。この横暴は取り除かれるだろう。私は自ら連邦捜査官を送り込み、警察に自ら行いを改めさせるか、あるいは、アフリカ系アメリカ人に対して残忍であり続け、人種差別的な南部主義者に都合の悪い法律の執行を拒否する不従順な警察官を大量に解雇するよう、各州に強制するつもりだ。公権力は常に行使されねばならないのである。"
 USA_lbj_64_for_those_worthy: "……相応の者たちのため"
 USA_lbj_64_for_those_worthy_desc: "我々は希望と自由の導き手であるべきだが、地球上の全ての人間に国境を簡単に開くべきではない。却って、我が国の安全保障上の問題となりうる技量不足に基づいて、一定数の人間を排除することを検討しなければならない。移民のモラルの欠如の可能性がある全てのことは、全て審査されねばならず、国家安全保障に脅威を与える場合は、排除されねばならない。しかし、主観的な倫理観に基づいて特定の人々の排除を考えた場合、それは自国の潜在能力に打撃を与えるなるだろう。この判断は、あらゆる選択肢を尊重した上で行わなければならない。"
 USA_lbj_64_immigration_nationality_act: "移民及び国籍業務関連法"
 USA_lbj_64_immigration_nationality_act_desc: "この法案は、より多くの移民が入国できるようにするものだ。だが彼らの入国は、潜在的なアメリカ人になりうるふさわしい資格に基づいて行われれる。学歴や必要な技能などの資格を持つ者は、新たな制度にて優先的に入国できるようになる。この法律にはもう一つ主要な規定がある。それは、移民に帰化のための明確な道筋を与えるというものだ。最後に、人種的資格は完全に撤廃され、この国の道徳的品性を表す、より公平で公正な入国制度が導入される。世界中の未来のアメリカ人のために、移民制度をより公平で公正なものにしようではないか。"
 USA_lbj_64_roof_over_head: "一つの頭上に屋根を"
 USA_lbj_64_roof_over_head_desc: "これ以上、社会的少数者のアメリカ人が住宅差別に苦しむことを容認する訳にはいかない。アフリカ系アメリカ人も、メキシコ人も、アジア人も、一生懸命出世しているにも関わらず、差別に苦しんでいるのだ。彼らの多くはスラム街、悲惨な場所、路上などで生活し、結局は我々に問題を引き起こしている。白人の有権者の多くが彼らとは関わりたくないと思っているにもかかわらず、有色人種を苦しめ続けるのは、我が国の印象を悪くするだけだ。さらに次の選挙ではこれらの有権者から票を得られない可能性もある。私は、我々の団結のためだけでなく、アメリカのためにも、共和党員と民主党に対して公正住宅法を支持するよう懇願する。"
 USA_lbj_64_ghetto_riots: "ゲットー暴動を利用"
 USA_lbj_64_ghetto_riots_desc: "混沌を見てみろ！略奪、破壊、暴力は、我らの偉大な都市の大部分を廃墟にしている。そしてこの略奪と破壊は、危機を解決できない現政権のせいで、貧しく、困窮し、酷く悲惨な状態にあるアフリカ系アメリカ人のゲットーから生じている。黒人コミュニティからの怒りと怒りを和らげるために、また、あらゆる人種間の暴力をこれ以上増やさないために、何か策を講じなければならない。暴動は法案を停滞させたままの現在の政府の失敗を示すものである。この怠惰を終わらせなければ、黒人市民は将来危険に晒されることになるだろう。"
 USA_lbj_64_yes_in_my_backyard: "地元で「イエス」と言おう！"
 USA_lbj_64_yes_in_my_backyard_desc: "あなたの美しい郊外の家や素晴らしい地域に恵まれない人々が入ってくるのを心配する気持ちは分かる。もしかしたら近所の評判が悪くなるのではないか、トラブルを起こすのではないか、社会に馴染めず排除されてしまうのではないか、と恐れているかもしれない。だがそんな事はない！もしあなたが議員に公正住宅法を支持させることができれば、それによって恵まれない人々が、自らの努力と献身であなたの水準にまで達することを保証できるのだ。結果的に、住みやすくなった恵まれた人々は、あなたの友人となり、むしろご近所付き合いを強くしてくれるはずだ。私は、あなたが善良で親切なアメリカ市民として、恵まれない人々が自立してより幸せな生活を送るために奮闘しているのを助けるよう懇願する。より良い地元のために「イエス」と言おう！"
 USA_lbj_64_the_FHA: "公正住宅法"
 USA_lbj_64_the_FHA_desc: "我々は公民権についてこれまでやってきたが、今を以て終わらせねばならない。公正住宅法を押し通せれば、公民権論争において、現政権の最後の大きな業績となるだろう。住宅の賃貸や販売におけるあらゆる差別を禁止することで、町や都市の特徴に大きな変化がもたらされるはずだ。\n\nだが公正住宅法は、これがもたらす変化の大きさと、この政権による最後の「偉大な」公民権法案という位置づけから、政治的大騒動の中心となっている。人種的分離主義者は住宅問題を「強制的な人種差別撤廃」における最後の防壁と見做しており、この法案に強く反対するだろう。党内には、保守派との対立を避けるため、妥協を促す声も少なくない。その一方、アフリカ系アメリカ人は、大統領が約束を守るかどうか、ホワイトハウスに注目している。\n\nどのような選択も結果を伴うが、我々は選択せねばならない。"
 USA_lbj_64_war_on_poverty: "貧困との戦争"
 USA_lbj_64_war_on_poverty_desc: "産業革命の黎明期から、貧困は社会の大きな足かせとなり、米国を苦しめてきた。今も、都市部から農村に至るまで数百万もの人々が惨めな暮らしをしており、経済的機会の欠如は何世代にもわたってアメリカ人を苦難の連鎖に陥れている。だがそれも終わりだ！今、アメリカはどんな国よりも古くて捉え所のない敵である貧困と戦う状態に入っている。新たな計画と発案を通じて、貧困を撲滅し、全ての人が政府の支援によって成功できるようにするのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_community_action_initiative: "地域社会での活動の取り組み"
 USA_lbj_64_community_action_initiative_desc: "国や連邦政府規模で貧困に完璧に対処するというのも良いが、全米の地域社会を動員することで経済的困窮に立ち向かうために必要なマンパワーを得ることができる。地域規模と社会規模両方での参加を促す新しい支援プログラムがあれば貧困層にも機会を与え、誰も生活に窮することがないようにできる。連邦政府は、貧困にあえぐ地域社会の繁栄への導き手となるだろう。"
 USA_lbj_64_job_corps: "職業部隊を提案"
 USA_lbj_64_job_corps_desc: "労働省だけでなく大統領までもが、若者の失業率に大きな関心を寄せている。そこで、福祉や公的機関などによる出張サービスのためのプログラムにもう一つ加えて、職業部隊の設立を目指す。この組織は労働省の管轄下に置かれ、若者にさまざまな分野の教育を提供するとともに自立できるようになるまで、国立公園、貧困地域、連邦政府の責任下にあるその他の地域を改善させる仕事を彼らに提供する。願わくばこのプログラムが、これを最も必要とする者に重要な訓練と経験を提供することを。"
 USA_lbj_64_vista_of_future: "未来のVISTA"
 USA_lbj_64_vista_of_future_desc: "OEO傘下の組織として次に提案されているのが、アメリカボランティア奉仕団、VISTAだ。VISTAは低所得者層に新たな機会を提供すると同時に、全米に貢献することを目的としている。平和部隊と同様、VISTAはボランティア活動をする対価として、安定した収入、健康保険、その他数多くの特典を提供する。VISTA参加者は外の地域に目を向けるだけではなく、今日の産業経済が求める多くの役割を果たすために必要なスキルも身に付く。さあ働こう！"
 USA_lbj_64_more_food_stamps: "フードスタンプ制度の強化"
 USA_lbj_64_more_food_stamps_desc: "すでに、フードスタンプ制度は大きな成功を収めている。現在この制度を実施している地域では、貧困層がより多く食料を手に入れられるようになり、残飯を奪い合う必要はなくなった。しかしこの試みにも欠点がある。それは管理上の負担が大きくなっているということだ。また、スタンプを必要とする者全員に配布することも難しい。今後もフードスタンプ制度が拡大を続ける中で、これらの問題点の解決から目を離さないようにせねばならない。\n\n制度の成功を考慮して、全米に展開する時が来た。すぐにでも、新たに州への展開を開始しよう。そう遠くないうちに、全国民がフードスタンプ制度にアクセスできるようになるはずだ。この一歩で、我々の貧困との戦いは勝利に近づくだろう。"
 USA_lbj_64_EOA_act: "経済機会法"
 USA_lbj_64_EOA_act_desc: "貧困に苦しむ人々の大半は、単に運が悪く、這い上がれない底辺に突き落とされたのだ。職を失った結果、再就職もできずに貧困層に転落する市民も少なくはない。我々は国民が道端に倒れ、見捨てられ、忘れ去れられゆくのを許さない。\n\nジョンソン大統領は、このような問題に対処するための新しい法案を提出するつもりだ。経済機会法は、失業手当の増額と、再就職のための政府支援サービスの提供から始まる。これ以外にも、この法律はすでに働いている労働者を支援し、連邦最低賃金を引き上げる。この新しい法案は我々が目指しているものを国民に示し、さらなる立法への道を開くのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_consolidate_programs: "プログラムの統合"
 USA_lbj_64_consolidate_programs_desc: "我らの政権期間中に、各地で支援プログラムを作ることができた。これらのプログラムは有益であるが、州単位で運営する際、終わりなきお役所仕事によって常に遅れている。より多くの人に支援の手を差し伸べるには、お役所仕事を効率化してゆかねばならない。\n\n全てのプログラムを連邦政府下に統合することで、管理負担とコストの両方の削減ができる。だが大勢が、州から管理を奪うことを、連邦権力の拡大だと考えるだろう。国内の保守的な地域では、人気のある施策とは言い難いものだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_increase_minimum_benefits: "最低給付額の引き上げ"
 USA_lbj_64_increase_minimum_benefits_desc: "現在の給付制度は、貧困層にとってはありがたい救済措置であるが、最貧困層にとってはこの給付ですら十分ではない。もし全てのアメリカ人を貧困と破滅から救いたいのであれば、最貧困層の受給者への給付額を増額せねばならない。彼らが必要とする援助を与えることだけが、貧困の悪循環から抜け出せるのである。"
 USA_lbj_64_nobody_left_behind: "誰も取り残さない"
 USA_lbj_64_nobody_left_behind_desc: "我々は素晴らしい仕事をしたに違いない。国を運営したこの数年間で、我々の政権は、一般アメリカ人の生活改善において大きな進歩を果たした。教育を改革し、社会保障制度を整備し、然るべき医療への利用を拡大した。偉大な社会計画は救いの手を差し伸べ、アメリカをより良い場所にした。だが、もっと良い場所にすることができる。\n\n偉大な社会計画は、信条、性別、人種に関係なく、全てのアメリカ人を支援するために作られた。今こそ、この国の恵まれない人々に手を差し伸べるべき時だ。社会的少数者や女性、そして全ての被差別者が、より良い仕事、より良い教育を求める機会を与えるための法案作成に着手する。一部の者達がどう感じていようと、我々は未来を歩む道において、如何なるアメリカ人も取り残さないのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_safety_net: "セーフティネット"
 USA_lbj_64_safety_net_desc: "経済的に最も危険にさらされている個人や企業は、突然の災害や金銭的な挫折によって簡単に崖っぷちに追い込まれる。我々は、このような人々が、突然の予期せぬ出費による最悪の影響から身を守るための手段である、経済的な「セーフティネット」を利用できるようにしなければならない。そのために、普通預金口座と保険の利用をしやすく、また質を向上させるための法律を導入し、国民が常にお金を確保できるようにすることが必要だ。"
 USA_lbj_64_neither_race_nor_class: "人種でも階級でもなく"
 USA_lbj_64_neither_race_nor_class_desc: "我々はとうに、アメリカに自由をもたらすために多くのことをやってきたが、臨むべき問題は未だに残っている。国民はもはや人種による法律上の負担は残っていないが、多くの社会的少数者が依然として、永年の経済無視と迫害の結果、経済事情に非常に恵まれていない。もし我々が本当に過去の束縛から自由であるならば、既存の公民権法を改正し、経済的に不利な立場にある人々にも具体的な法的保護を与える必要がある。我々は、すべての人が、人種や肌の色、身分に関係なく、敬意と尊厳を持って扱われるようにしなければならない。"
 USA_lbj_64_right_to_liberty: "自由の権利"
 USA_lbj_64_right_to_liberty_desc: "「われわれは、以下の事実を自明のことと信じる。すなわち、すべての人間は生まれながらにして平等であり、その創造主によって、生命、自由、および幸福の追求を含む不可侵の権利を与えられているということ」-アメリカ独立宣言\n\nこれは、アメリカが建国された時の約束であった。だが残念なことに、これまでに多くの国民がこの約束を破ってきた。今、我らは、すべての人間が自由であることを保証する。すべてのアメリカ人は、法と貧困の両方に囚われることなく生きることができる。黒人も白人も、金持ちも貧乏人も、若者も老人も、全ての人間が平等な立場に置かれ、そこからアメリカを最高の国にするために協力し合うのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_welfare_of_people: "国民の福祉"
 USA_lbj_64_welfare_of_people_desc: "東西の敵と比べれば経済的に成功していると錯覚していたが、この国には多くの危機が存在しており、最下層の人々を襲い続けている。ホームレス、貧困、そして基本サービスさえ受けることができない……この状況が、今や国の風物詩となっており、新たなプログラムを通じて、ジョンソン大統領はアメリカが直面する国内問題に対処しようとしている。何世紀もの間、連邦政府は憲法上の制約やその他の障害によって貧困層の救済に後手に回ってきた。今こそ、連邦政府の役割を見直し、「一般の福祉を増進する」という言葉が、理想ではなく義務なのだということを明確にすべきなのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_prevention_best_cure: "予防こそが最善の治療"
 USA_lbj_64_prevention_best_cure_desc: "今日の経済で成功に必要な手段を奪われた地域では、貧困が根付いている。だからこそ、それが花開く前に芽を摘まねばならない。高等教育の基準を設け、資金不足の教育機関に助成金を出すことで、アメリカの若者たちが絶えず変化する経済の中で高度な仕事に就くのに十分な教育を受けられるのを確実にするのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_begin_pilot_programs: "社会実験の開始"
 USA_lbj_64_begin_pilot_programs_desc: "終わりなき貧困の力に対するジョンソン大統領の対決の準備は進行中である。この闘争を始めるため、我々は一連の小規模支援計画を議会で可決させる。それ自体は大きな影響を与えることはないが、今後数ヶ月のうちにさらに大きな計画の土台となることを願っている。しかし、短期的にこれはアメリカの貧困層に利益を与えるかもしれない。"
 USA_lbj_64_create_OEO: "経済機会局を創設"
 USA_lbj_64_create_OEO_desc: "アメリカの貧困層を耐え難い苦難から救い出そうというジョンソン大統領の政策は、終始一貫して巨大事業となる。新たな官僚機構とそれに付随する数々のプログラムの創設には、大規模な調整が必要だ。大統領の命令で創設した経済機械局は、全プログラムを整理し、我々が講じる全ての施策が円滑に進むようにする。"
 USA_lbj_64_assess_current_programs: "現行プログラムの評価"
 USA_lbj_64_assess_current_programs_desc: "Before new programs can be proposed and passed into law, an inquiry into the current federal policy situation is warranted. Currently, various welfare programs from past administrations exist, with their own funds and bureaucracies, under the executive branch. Before moving to more bold measures, President Johnson has recommended an examination of these programs to determine the best method of management is for future programs. Determining what is unnecessary and \"cutting the fat\" where needed would also be prudent for the sake of fiscal responsibility."
 USA_lbj_64_stopgap_measures: "応急措置"
 USA_lbj_64_stopgap_measures_desc: "Like most major changes in federal policy, the expansion and creation of the welfare system will take time, both due to opposition and the overall sluggishness of the American system of government in implementing reform. However, for the moment, more gradual and incremental measures can be taken to temporarily quench the need for aid. Most of these programs will be short-lived, only providing fixes in the short term that give economic assistance to the needy. Much greater projects are coming down the pipeline but a reminder to the people that something is being done to address these issues will go a long way."
 USA_lbj_64_protect_most_vulnerable: "最も弱い立場の人々を守る"
 USA_lbj_64_protect_most_vulnerable_desc: "Like in so many other economic crises, the ones most affected by our defective healthcare system are the nation's poor. Even as the advancement of technology marches forward, they are tragically left behind and swindled out of the care they need. In the first of many acts to improve the situation, President Johnson has signed a list of executive orders and urged legislation through Congress. These preliminary bills, which will do little on the long run, aim to protect those who cannot take care of themselves due to the unchecked distortion of the healthcare industry."
 USA_lbj_64_trumans_idea: "トルーマンは正しいアイデアを持っていた！"
 USA_lbj_64_trumans_idea_desc: "20年前、トルーマン上院議員は、アメリカの医療制度に革命を起こす法案を提出した。医療業界の惨状を目の当たりにした彼は、拡大する問題に対処するため、政府による広範な活動を提案したのだ。彼の提案の中核は、医療の全てを対象にする国民皆保険と、国中に病院を建設するための巨額の投資であった。この種の政策は以前から遅きに失してしまったが、ジョンソン大統領はトルーマンが国民の健康を守るために唱えた政策の多くを採用することにした。"
 USA_lbj_64_revisit_wmd_bill: "W-M-D法案の再検討"
 USA_lbj_64_revisit_wmd_bill_desc: "1945年、ワグナー、マレー、ディンゲル各上院議員は、国の医療制度を改革するための法案を議会に提出した。この法案は、すべてのアメリカ人が利用できる国民皆保険制度を導入するものであった。残念なことに、当時は激動の時代であったため、このような急進的な改革は成立する前に打ち切られた。だが今、この法案の時代が来たようだ。W-M-D法案は改訂と修正を通じて、最も良き部分をすぐにでも実現できるはずだ。そしてその先には、政府が直接支援する国家制度の構築があるのだ。"
 USA_lbj_64_reintroduce_social_security: "社会保障の拡大"
 USA_lbj_64_reintroduce_social_security_desc: "Social Security has played an enormous role in combating poverty and helping the aged and infirm. Nobody would deny it is one of the more popular programs that have prevented some of the worst issues of the Great Depression. However, we have to step back and realize now it's not enough to get the results we need.\n\nSocial Security will be set up to properly take care of those who cannot work. We will provide more benefits to the people under its purview, especially for those who are disabled. No longer will it be a simple program of old age insurance, it will provide wide ranging relief to people who cannot work due to unfortunate fate or the passage of time. We will once again reaffirm that regardless of the challenges one may face, they will not be left behind by this union."

 USA_lbj_64_reassure_public_desc: "While support from the Republican establishment is nonetheless important, gaining the approval of the public at large is the most critical aspect of any campaign for large-scale reform. So far, the people have been reluctant to get behind the Great Society concept. To allay their concerns, the President must go public through direct addresses via the radio, television, and other mediums. The aim of these measures is not to only encourage voting in like-minded members of Congress but also to pressure current Congress members."

 USA_lbj_64_unity_above_all_desc: "If anything is to be done in the implementation of Great Society programs, lasting support for the Republican Party is an imperative. For this reason, we must show solidarity with Republican leaders, even if that means compromising on some of the issues most critical to President Johnson's campaign. While ensuring their support is a double-edged sword, it is important nonetheless to the passage of the Social Security Expansion Act and further legislation. While some goals will be left unachieved, abandoning allies in Congress would be a poor choice."

 USA_lbj_64_break_with_democrats_desc: "Token reassurances to the party establishment have proven insufficient to gaining their full support in the push for Social Security expansion and further programs. Unfortunately, Republican leaders have failed to listen to the very constituents who elected them to their privileged positions and they have been unceasingly reluctant to commit to President Johnson's initiative. For this reason, ties must be cut with this corrupt establishment if any future progress is to be made. Hopefully, a new coalition can be formed to finish what the President has started."

Through the implementation of welfare programs, the government will fulfill its most important role as outlined by the Founding Fathers: protecting its citizens from suffering and economic ruin. The Great Society extends beyond mere handouts to those who need it; it is a fulfillment of the most fundamental roles of American government."

 USA_lbj_64_we_need_to_pay_desc: "The unfortunate reality is every dollar we spend has to come from somewhere else. While simply deficit spending may be an option in other cases, the unique nature of Social Security as an insurance program makes this not an option. Every dollar we spend must come from someone in some way, or we will not be able to provide benefits and the structure will collapse. So, as unpopular as it is, we have to take money from Peter to pay Paul.\n\nWe have multiple options as to how to do this, and each has their benefits and downsides. Simply increasing the payroll taxes already in place could pay for it. Or we could raise income taxes in order to provide for the program. Whatever the choice, we have to pick one and hope it doesn't anger Congress enough to kill the bill."

Now, it will go to the floor for congress to debate. And they will have a lot to pour over.\n\nIn the bill are large expansions of benefits for the people previously covered by the program. Unemployed, retired, dependents, all will see much greater relief thanks to this act. In their ranks too will be disabled people who are unable to support themselves due to injuries. It is up to Congress to pass this act without delay, so we can finally provide millions of struggling Americans with peace of mind and allow them access to a better way of life."

However, there are much greater plans to pursue in order to fulfill the Great Society that President Johnson has envisioned for the United States, and we must remain diligent moving forward. There are still many left unprotected and uninsured by the act, including younger individuals who still suffer from the worst effects of poverty. Greater programs will have to be created and more initiatives taken if we hope to build a society where no one lives without a safety net."

The United States is a nation of nearly 200 million people, and no matter how many we help, there will always be some who fall through the cracks. Our system is good and noble, but we must not grow complacent. There are always more people who need some help to realize their fullest potential.

We face down annihilation every day, living in the hopes that cool heads will prevail even in the most aggressive of nations. In times such as these, it can seem that nothing we can do will ever be enough. Sitting in the Oval Office, President Johnson contemplates the nature of the world, and if what we are doing can hold a candle to the darkness."

A place of endless opportunity, where all men may freely pursue their own betterment in the name of the American Dream. As long as our values are maintained the light of liberty will shine on, and the hope of freedom and justice will never perish! That we try to make our world better even against the darkest threats we have ever faced proves that there is goodness in men, and President Johnson comforts himself in the solace that we can always count on the spirit of America to lead humanity to a better future."

The so-called \"healthcare industry\" consistently drives up prices on its services, putting lifesaving care out of reach for millions of Americans. Our reliance on the private sector to carry the burden of the country's healthcare has been misplaced; now it is time for us to pick up the slack. President Johnson has proposed a series of programs to repair this fundamentally broken system. Regulations, financial aid, publicly funded options, all actions must be considered if we are to insure the health of our citizens."

 USA_lbj_64_insurance_companies_desc: "We are making great progress in our campaign to institute a national healthcare system but, in order to fully implement such a system, we will have to enlist the support of the very insurance companies who have caused the problems we seek to address. To do this, we will provide financial incentives to these corporations in the form of subsidies to secure their assistance as we write more legislation.

To remedy the situation, we must draw from the existing insurance market to handle these issues. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is a fantastic candidate for the implementation of Medicare, Medicaid, and other nationwide insurance programs as proposed by Johnson's Great Society. Existing as an association of various insurance companies across the country, the organization will be vital to our plans going forward."

Its stated goal is the betterment of public health, and it plays a critical role in physician specialization in the medical system. The organization also holds significant political clout, often partaking in copious lobbying for interests that are often against our stated goals. With this in mind, we must recognize the importance of gaining their support before we pass any more legislation. Whether through favors, grants, or possibly threats, we will bring the AMA into the fold."

 USA_lbj_64_workplace_healthcare_act_desc: "The Workplace Healthcare Act is the next step in a gradual march toward a robust and federally supported insurance system. Serving as a check on the often harmful and abusive policies of insurance companies, the act proposes a number of protections for the nation's consumers. These include the obligation for price transparency and visibility to prevent exploitation and a requirement that all companies provide insurance regardless of pre-existing disabilities, sex, or any other conceivable factors. For years, corporations tasked with providing insurance have used their privileged positions to profit off of the struggles of unwitting customers. This newly proposed act will prevent such practices."
 USA_lbj_64_pressure_states: "州への圧力"
 USA_lbj_64_pressure_states_desc: "Predictably, many states have opposed the passage of further legislation in Congress and have been reluctant to participate in the implementation of our programs. Admittedly, the effects on state-level budgets have been stressful, but, with sufficient reorganization, they should be manageable. To encourage participation in our newly constructed system, we will have to pressure them into cooperation. The ways this could manifest our extensive, but negative and positive reinforcement are both on the table. By giving benefits to states who adopt our programs and threatening to revoke critical funds in other areas to those who do not, we can keep the states in line."

 USA_lbj_64_medicare_medicaid_desc: "Medicare and Medicaid are the flagship programs of the larger to reform our nation's healthcare, and they have proven invaluable for the coverage of retired, disabled, and financially struggling Americans. In this new age of broad healthcare coverage, however, these programs are both in dire need of an update. As the strain on our bureaucracy increases, we will need to expand Medicare and Medicaid to accommodate the needs of a growing body of recipients. Now, millions rely on publicly funded insurance programs for their coverage, and a degree of revitalization is necessary to manage the burden."

 USA_lbj_64_budget_drafts_desc: "Our plans for a new healthcare system will need funding, and if we are to win people over, we must prove that such a plan is feasible. We will get our economic advisors working on drawing up some budgets and show our critics that we can make this work. As the most economically sound nation on the planet, it shouldn't be too difficult to gather up the necessary money, but we will still need to convince people that it is a worthwhile use of funds."

 USA_lbj_64_doctor_corps_desc: "Inspired by the Teacher Corps, we will also establish a so called \"Doctor Corps.\" Like their educational counterparts, the men and women of the Doctor Corps will take part in outreach programs to deprived areas, filling in the gaps in local healthcare provision and giving cheap treatments to the poorest who need it. Aspiring doctors fresh out of college could readily seek internship in the program to gain valuable experience and to give back to their communities, though they would be led by qualified professionals whose work would be subsidized by us."

 USA_lbj_64_radical_proposal_desc: "Now that we have laid down the necessary groundwork and drawn up our plans, it is time to formally draft a bill. The creation of a government funded, national standard of healthcare has never before been attempted in the United States, and naturally our sceptics are vocal and numerous. We will need to fight our case hard all the way through to the end, using all the evidence and models we have established to argue our point. It will be difficult, and given the gravity of our task we must brace for disappointment. If we are successful, however, we could usher in a whole new era of health and wellbeing for all Americans."

In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die untended. In a great land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read and write.\" - President Lyndon B. Johnson, Inaugural Address\n\nWith our healthcare plan secured, another pillar of the Great Society has fallen into place. No longer will our people be left out of pocket when they need help the most. The right to life is sacrosanct and must be granted to all Americans, no matter the cost.

It will take a while before things are at maximum operational capacity, but we can soon expect a massive increase in the quality of public health."

 USA_lbj_64_teach_them_well_desc: "On its most basic level, education is the process of instilling knowledge into children to prepare them for the job market. However, it extends beyond the practical applications. Education is more than teaching and testing; it is an investment into the nation's children, America's future. While the United States has produced some of the greatest technological innovators in the world, ineffective teachers and poorly funded schools continue to leave millions of children behind, depriving them of the ability and the freedom to succeed in a demanding economy. It is time for the federal government to intervene, to protect their future and the nation's."
 USA_lbj_64_head_start: "「ヘッドスタート」プログラム"
 USA_lbj_64_head_start_desc: "In order to foster an education system where none are left behind, a new regime of agencies will need to be created. The proposed \"Head Start\" programs, under the purview of the Department of Health and Human Services, will play a pivotal role in the creation of such a system. These programs aim to ease the transition from preschool to elementary school, improve learning abilities, and create a home environment that encourages rather than discourages school participation for students if possible. \"Head Start\" will entail the employment of teachers and the opening of facilities throughout the country to aid low-income families."
 USA_lbj_64_teacher_unions: "教員組合との対話"
 USA_lbj_64_teacher_unions_desc: "Public teachers' unions, notably the American Federation of Teachers, wield a tremendous amount of influence over the education system, most of which is executed through campaigning and lobbying. Since they will be the ones educating children in the revitalized education system, winning their support, especially for ambitious legislation, will be critical to the implementation of many programs. To hopefully codify an alliance, members of the Department of Health and Human Services will meet with union leaders across the country to gain their support, meaning some promises will have to be made."

 USA_lbj_64_assess_material_needs_desc: "The implementation of new education programs will doubtless be a costly undertaking, and one thing central to this initiative will be insuring that schools are correctly stocked. To determine what is needed and where, an examination of the nation's individual schools is necessary. Once this census can be concluded, the process of apportioning textbooks and other classroom supply funds to state and local governments can begin so that every school has the tools for a modern, efficient education."

 USA_lbj_64_first_education_act_desc: "After months of preparation and revision by the Cabinet, Congressional committees, and various interest groups, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act can be proposed to the legislature. The bill contains numerous provisions, the most important among them being the apportionment of funds to schools throughout the country to improve education and the school environment how administrators see fit. Included also in the bill's language is an encouragement for equality on racial and economic grounds so America's students can be free to receive a strong and equal education."
 USA_lbj_64_our_past: "彼らは我々の過去であり"
 USA_lbj_64_our_past_desc: "President Johnson has made one thing clear in his campaign to revive and stimulate the nation's education system: we must fund education, not only during youth but also beyond it. Through funding schools and universities alike, we will create a system in which anyone can pursue a fulfilling career in adulthood made possible by a robust youth education. It is through the people who followed their love of knowledge outside of school that we have reached this point and, by using their contributions, we can create the next generation of innovators."
 USA_lbj_64_our_future: "彼らは我らの未来である"
 USA_lbj_64_our_future_desc: "The importance of education on all levels cannot be understated. Through greater funds to American schools and universities, we can create new opportunities for people looking for higher education that, through no fault of their own, lack the means to pay for tuition. Providing a full education to all who need it is not only a preference but a moral imperative, as the people we help now will be the ones who create new innovations that revolutionize the world around them and move society forward. To neglect those with these skills would be unjust."
 USA_lbj_64_funding_schools: "学校への資金援助"
 USA_lbj_64_funding_schools_desc: "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has massively stimulated the flow of money from the federal government to America's classrooms but one act can hardly cover an entire nation. Some states are more in need of aid than others and, to address individual issues, funds will need to be allocated via earmarks and other grants. Local administrations often face unique issues specific to their area that extend beyond low incomes. The Johnson administration will provide a helping hand to level the playing field."

 USA_lbj_64_teacher_corps_desc: "The Teacher Corps is the next proposed program to kickstart education in low-income communities across the country through teachers' associations that specialize in community outreach. Areas throughout the United States would each have individual projects headed by professors and institutions specializing in higher education who would then employ aspiring teachers as interns. These interns would then teach students in disadvantaged communities, thus helping to lift disadvantaged families out of the poverty cycle while gaining valuable skills in the process. Hopefully, the program will help both teachers and students."
 USA_lbj_64_funding_colleges: "大学への資金援助"
 USA_lbj_64_funding_colleges_desc: "While elementary and secondary schools present much greater and resource-intensive problems than higher education, a college education is nonetheless vital to more skilled professions in the job market. Funds to public and private universities will receive the bulk of our attention, perhaps in exchange for practices to give opportunities to less-advantaged applicants. Either way, higher education is in need of federal assistance, and the cost of allowing higher education to deteriorate is much greater than the proposed federal funding."

 USA_LBJ_national_endowment_of_humanities_desc: "The intellectual life of a nation is one of the greatest indicators of its long-term vitality. The fascist project has been defined by the abject submission of the individual, the assumption that a society must pull inexorably towards a singular purpose defined by the state. Of what use, then, are the humanities and social sciences to a fascist society? None; but this breeds an intellectual stagnation and myopism that rots society from within, as seen in the recent German Civil War. A free society survives not in spite of intellectual diversity, that which the fascists deride as 'degeneracy'; it survives because of it."

 USA_LBJ_school_bonus_2_desc: "As a result of President Lyndon Johnson's Higher Education Act, schools across America are undergoing massive renovations and are generally becoming much more effective at educating the youth of the nation. Teachers are being paid more, leading to much greater teacher motivation and student retention rates. In addition, many more young Americans are able to go to college, as federal scholarship money is now in abundance. Despite all these positives however, the Higher Education Act only provides for greater education funding for a few years. Within less than a decade, the bill will be expired, and most of the good the bill achieved will vanish from America's hands."

 USA_LBJ_immigration_bonus_desc: "From the conclusion of the Second World War to the present day, immigrating to the United States has been almost impossible for those from non-OFN nations. Now, however, President Lyndon Johnson's Immigration and Nationality Act has allowed hundreds of thousands of Americans-in-waiting to finally cross the seas to live the American dream. These people range from dock workers to doctors, and, despite some criticism, will likely make the United States a greater nation. Nevertheless, due to compromises made on the part of the President, the act will expire within a few years. As it stands, the lucky few foreigners who arrive during this short period may comprise the last immigration wave the United States will see for decades to come."

Some of these issues were mostly compatible with President Johnson's intended course, but a sticking point did emerge. A key demand - that [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName] insisted he would not budge on - was that the President do more to resolve the ongoing civil rights issue, with [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName] sadly admitting that his party had not done quite enough to truly finish the job.\n\nWhile not necessarily opposed to this, President Johnson knew that extending the reach of civil rights legislation would not sit well with the more conservative Republicans and may well drive some of them to the Nationalists.

In addition, his promise to review the civil rights issue has reportedly led some of the more conservative senators to quietly exchange words with the Nationalist wing of the NPP, perhaps considering whether they may find better leadership and representation under their banner.\n\nThis newest internal crisis is fast becoming yet another hurdle for President Johnson's plans for the country. While some note that he is certainly shaking up a largely stagnant political theatre, the reality for the President is much more of a headache.

He has made it clear that though he fully intends to work with the Progressives to pass some crucial reforms, he firmly believes that the bond between the Republicans and Democrats is more important than ever, and he will do whatever it takes to ensure that this bond is maintained.\n\nHowever, Johnson has also taken a more aggressive and assertive attitude to some of the more stubborn Republicans who still see him as unworthy of leading them. Often bringing up the fact that the Republican popularity still hasn't recovered since the loss of the Second World War, Johnson has subtly reminded the Republicans that their party would have been consigned to irrelevancy by now had the Republican-Democratic Coalition not been established. This combined with some other rather bullish statements, some of which could be construed as mild threats towards certain senators, has rendered some of the loudest opponents within the party notably silent in recent days.\n\nFor the time being it seems the Republicans have been calmed, and President Johnson's deal with the Progressive NPP now draws little more consternation than wild speculation from the media.

This includes forbidding the implementation of any sort of voting qualification, prerequisite or any other act of interference against a person's right to vote on the basis of race, color or language.\n\nA debate has arisen on the matter of certain special provisions that may be added to the bill. These provisions include legally requiring all jurisdictions to provide election materials to voters in multiple languages, allowing federal oversight in any state or local level change to election laws, and the appointment of federal examiners to oversee voter registration functions to make sure the provisions are being implemented. The debate has grown fierce, with the Nationalists and some Republicans arguing these provisions amount to federal tyranny, while the Progressive NPP insists that they are absolutely necessary to protect the voting rights of America's most vulnerable. Many within the Democrats meanwhile argue that a compromise would be best, allowing some special provisions in return for some conservative amendments.\n\nHow strong these provisions are, if they are implemented at all, will need to be decided before we can take the bill to vote.

The Klansmen formed a temporary alliance with the police chief in charge of the operation, and soon came down upon the protestors with clubs and other weapons. Now, with most of the Birmingham riot concluded, at least 19 people, 12 of them African American, are confirmed dead."
 LBJ.16.a: "What a goddamn mess!"
 LBJ.17.t: "Southern Obstinance"
 LBJ.17.desc: "Today, President Johnson has held a press conference to address the major issues at hand with the implementation of Civil Rights across America. Many have openly claimed that discrimination is still heavily present across the nation, especially among police forces. The President, in a heavily anticipated statement, had this to say:\n\n\"It has been a great many weeks since the passing of America's most recent Civil Rights bill. However, it has come to the attention of our administration that in many cities across America, the segregated areas remain due to extreme police prejudice; that African Americans are still forced into lower class status due to the strength of the lawmen who were commanded to protect them. Additionally, there have been claims that certain discriminatory, supremacist organizations have infiltrated many municipal police departments. After so many reports from so many sources, it is my opinion that immediate action must be taken to rectify this issue. As such, our administration will be moving to reshuffle suspect police forces, mandate heavier background checks and screening measures for new officers, and break up the bonds between many law enforcement agencies and third party elements, such as the Klu Klux Klan.\"\n\nAlready, the move has drawn criticism from the South, most notably from Alabama Governor George Wallace, who called President Johnson a \"tyrant\" for \"his infringement upon the rights of states to enforce their own laws\". It would appear that many politicians of the Nationalist wing of the National Progressive Pact are moving to block any legislation that the Johnson Administration can introduce to regulate municipal police. As it stands, it appears that if the President wishes to see his desires realized, he may have to do it through executive order."
 LBJ.17.a: "States' Rights, huh?"
 LBJ.18.t: "Continued Resistance"
 LBJ.18.desc: "The meeting room had a thick, uncomfortable air to it, caused in no small part by the unusually low ceiling and the burning cigarettes of Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. The smoking AG sat opposite President Lyndon Johnson, with Governor of Mississippi Ross Barnett sitting just a few seats down. \"Kicking the Klan out of Southern police forces has been a more involved affair than previously thought,\" began Katzenbach.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Johnson, \"that's why we're here. Something's not working and we need to determine what it is.\"\n\n\"My recommended course of action is to break up the police departments at the core,\" said Katzenbach, \"senior and junior officers need to be more separated, and suspect departments should have full federal investigations placed onto them.\"\n\n\"Let's not push this too far,\" said Barnett, \"too much pressure and you might be facing a case in the Supreme Court. The current stress you're putting on them is more than enough, it just needs time to sort itself out.\"\n\n\"Fine then,\" sighed Katzenbach.\n\n\"I think we should put some additional measures on, just a bit lighter, perhaps. The discrimination is supposed to be bad in Georgia. I'll call up Governor Garland Byrd and tell him how we want to get his state in line-- he won't refuse the President, even if he has proven difficult in the past. If our plans work in Georgia, we'll apply them to the rest of the South.\""
 LBJ.18.a: "We can't just stop here."
 LBJ.18.b: "Hopefully the new rules work well."
 LBJ.19.t: "A Victory for the NPP"
 LBJ.19.desc: "Today, after the Johnson Administration suggested even stronger anti-police discrimination measures to the governor of Georgia, Lester Maddox, Alabama governor George Wallace gave an announcement on the steps of the Georgia State Capitol. In it, he called the new government suggestions \"a further proof of federal tyranny\" and that he \"will not punish Southern police officers for simply doing their job\". Wallace called upon all Southern States to resist any such requests by the federal government.\n\nPro-police organizations have gathered in many cities across the South in support of Wallace's rallying cry. Governor of Georgia, Lester Maddox, however, has commented little on the government suggestions as of yet, only saying he will not implement them. The South, it appears, will not bow to the Johnson Administration's new Civil Rights enforcement methods. What this means for the future is impossible to say, but the National Progressive Pact holds strong majorities in the South; majorities which seem here to stay.\n\nThe President himself was unavailable for comment on Governor Wallace's actions, but Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach had this to say: \"Mister Wallace's claim, that the United States federal government is overstepping its constitutional bounds with this mandate, is simply unfounded. The government has a right to look out for its citizens.\""
 LBJ.19.a: "Weak response from the government, but what can they do?"
 LBJ.20.t: "Days of Rage"
 LBJ.20.desc: "Once again, the nation is in uproar over the recent controversies surrounding the Johnson Administration's Civil Rights Act and their efforts to enforce it. Following a rebellious comment made by Alabama Governor George Wallace last week- one that many found offensive to African Americans and Civil Rights as a whole. Tens of thousands have poured out in protest in many major cities across the South, including Birmingham, Jackson, Atlanta, and New Orleans. These people are coming out not only against Wallace's statement, but also the Johnson Administration for allowing Southern States to refuse additional regulations.\n\nAs with prior Civil Rights demonstrations in the South, the protestors have come into conflict with municipal police forces, as well as local chapters of the Klu Klux Klan, in many cases. With violence dragging on into the afternoon, at least two hundred people have been injured, with around 34 dead. In several cities, such as Atlanta, the National Guard has been forced to step in and cease violence, with moderate success.\n\nSo far, responses from Governor Wallace or the Johnson Administration have been scarce, at best. Wallace has given only a few comments calling the protestors \"a band of hooligans\", before ordering the National Guard to restore order in some cities. President Johnson, on the other hand, has given no response whatsoever, with many White House sources claiming that he has secluded himself in the Oval Office, requesting not to be disturbed."
 LBJ.20.a: "Johnson... hiding?"
 LBJ.21.t: "\"An Assault on Law and Order\""
 LBJ.21.desc: "Both Dixiecrats and elements of the Nationalists have found themselves openly standing against the Johnson Administration after President Johnson himself refused to support the additional anti-discrimination measures proposed by Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. These changes come after more than a week of protests surrounding comments made by Georgia Governor George Wallace, in which he called upon the South to resist \"tyrannical\" government measures. In many cities, the protests became violent, taking a long time before either calming down or being stopped by local National Guard units.\n\nSenator Strom Thurmond called the week of protests an \"assault on law and order\", with Governor of Mississippi Ross Barnett calling it \"the Days of Rage\"-- a term now popular across much of the nation. Now, even the original anti-discrimination measures proposed by the Johnson Administration are being ignored in the South. The Klu Klux Klan seems to be openly working with local authorities, and hate crimes have skyrocketed. Overall, the past few weeks have proven disastrous for the President and the Democratic Party, and Johnson will likely see much more emboldened resistance from the South in the future."
 LBJ.21.a: "Disastrous!"
 LBJ.22.t: "人種主義に厳しい態度で挑む"
 LBJ.22.desc: "There has been a rise in the number of Civil Rights cases that have been working their way through the Department of Justice lately, with prosecutors, FBI agents and more all investigating a variety of racist incidents throughout the South, bringing police officers, Klansmen, white supremacist leaders and others to trial for their violence, intimidation, and flouting Civil Rights laws. While the gears of justice move slowly, and not all of the cases will be decided in the government's favor, there is a growing outcry throughout the South that the Feds are overstepping their authority, trying to criminalize personal opinions and thoughts, trampling the First Amendment and dismantling states' rights. One particular case, where a hotel owner in Georgia was arrested for allowing a white mob to break into a black man's room, tie him up, smash his belongings and threaten to lynch him, has become the focal point of this opposition, with Yockey's faction of the NPP denouncing the FBI's case, arguing it was overstepping their authority when the state courts could have handled this (and, undoubtedly, let the white hotel owner and the mob to walk free). Yet, Yockey has gained support throughout the South for his standing up to The Man, and his efforts to make the Black equal."

 LBJ.23.t: "A Break in the Storm"
 LBJ.23.desc: "After many weeks of sporadic protesting over the inability of the Johnson Administration to enforce its desegregation rules upon southern police departments, many cities across the South are beginning to calm down. With no protests and no injuries from clashes between the protestors and the Klu Klux Klan or police, it appears the violence is coming to an end. It appears Governor Maddox of Georgia and Governor Wallace of Alabama are also standing down, allowing the old federal rules to be enforced once more.\n\nThe period of violence, often called the \"Days of Rage\", led to weeks of violence between protestors and pro-police elements all across the South. These pro-police elements often consisted of the police themselves, as well as members of the white supremacist Klu Klux Klan. All told, over 60 Americans died during the fighting, with more than 1000 injured or hospitalized.\n\nIt appears the Johnson Administration, with the violence concluded, is moving to once again enforce its desegregation rules upon the South. After many weeks of chaotic, exhausting work, southern municipal police departments don't seem to be in a position to resist."

 LBJ.24.desc: "President Lyndon Johnson walked with his small cohort of Secret Service beneath the great dome of the Capitol. As the Senate was not currently in session, fewer people than usual stood in the rotunda, but one appeared to be approaching Johnson rather quickly. \"Governor Ross Barnett,\" Johnson said, recognizing the man, \"what a pleasant surprise. I was just going to meet with Rockefeller, care to join me?\"\n\nBarnett did not appear to be in an amiable mood. \"No, Mister President,\" he said curtly, \"I just came here to say I was disappointed with your Civil Rights bills.\"\n\n\"You voted for them, though, yes?\"\n\n\"Yes, but they went far beyond the scope of what we agreed too. You played too fast and too loose with the Southern Democrats' loyalty. We won't be so likely to give it next time.\"\n\nJohnson smiled, taking a step forward and placing his hand upon Barnett's shoulder. \"Congressman... I only did what I thought was morally right and was best for the country. We're all one party, aren't we? Now, let me tell you something,\" he said, his smile turning sour, \"if you ever threaten the integrity of the Republican-Democratic Coalition again, I'll run your career into the ground. Is that understood?\"\n\nBarnett nodded begrudgingly. \"Excellent,\" said Johnson, \"as long as we're all in agreement, right?\""

 LBJ.40.desc: "Beau Albright stepped out of his car, the balmy air of another sunny Alabama morning warming his skin. He walked along the sidewalk to the entrance of his pride and joy: Albright Deli and Butcher. Some people might think running a butcher store to be a poor career, but Beau had built this store with his bare hands and he was exceedingly proud. He unlocked the door, stepped inside, and began his work of breaking down a fresh hog he had received yesterday.\n\nNot long after he had finished splitting the pig into its constituent parts, a man in a suit stepped through the door, flanked by the local sheriff, James Green. The suited man introduced himself as David Smith, an attorney from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The federal man was definitely an out-of-towner from his yankee accent. \"Mister Beau Albright,\" he began, \"I am here to inform you that your business is in violation of new federal Civil Rights mandates. You must remove your 'Whites Only' sign.\"\n\nBeau stood there, as if not comprehending the man's words. He looked at Sheriff Green, who shrugged. \"I built this place with my own two hands,\" he said, \"don't I got a right to choose who I let into my store? Them negroes is a dirty folk; if I start lettin' em in, I'll lose all my good customers.\"\n\n\"If you don't start letting them in,\" said the yankee, \"I have the authority to pursue legal action against you, potentially leading to the condemnation of your property. Take down your sign.\"\n\nWith that, the yankee turned on a heel and left the dumpy little butcher shop. Beau looked at Sheriff Green. \"You can't let that carpet-baggin' son of a bitch do this to me,\" he said, \"this is a violation of my rights!\"\n\nSheriff Green sighed, \"If you're really angry, call the governor's office.

It was a report of thousands of businesses across the South who had refused to observe the new desegregation rules that the government had been attempting to enforce for the past few weeks. Flipping through pages and pages of names, dates, and places, the President finally reached the end of the report. \"Given the vast amount of resistance to Civil Rights, it seems necessary that for more effective enforcement, more strict punishments for offending entities are in order.\"\n\nJohnson sighed. He knew that the South would always try to push back against such measures. Any single step he took in any direction would cause a massive amount of political backlash, either in the South or in the rest of the nation. Few men knew just how hard it was being President, and rarely was it more difficult than in situations such as these. He could do nothing; or do something, and be hated."

Negroes ain't got no business being in my store, no matter how much that damn yankee attorney tells me I can't stop 'em.\"\n\n\"Oh, Beau,\" said Penelope, \"you ain't never been so riled up before. It was a three hour drive to Birmingham, I'm surprised you're still so upset. Anyhow, I sure do hope there's good seats for us.\"\n\nThey filed past the ticket inspector's booth into the stadium. It was filled with thousands of people; even down on the field, thousands of filled seats surrounded George Wallace's platform in the middle. Beau and Penelope surprisingly found empty seats there, not 50 feet from the governor. They sat and listened to George Wallace talk about segregation for what felt like half an hour. \"Now,\" said Wallace, \"who here is a small business owner?\"\n\nBeau stood up in a sea of seated men and women. Wallace called him up to the stage. \"What's your name, friend? Have you been to a National Progressive rally before?\"\n\nBeau almost seized up in front of the thousands who were watching. \"Uh, my name's Beau. Beau Albright. My shop was forced to let in negroes by a fed'ral inspector. Uhm... I ain't never really cared for politics-\"\n\nHis words were cut out by a thunder of applause from the audience. George Wallace took the microphone from Beau's hands. \"Do you hear that? An average, nonpartisan businessman was forced, against his will, to integrate. This is what President Johnson wants! He wants to take away our right to choose, not just as states, but as people. He's stepping up his enforcement measures and I say let him! The National Progressive Pact will stand for what's right.

 LBJ.43.desc: "Strong criticism for the Johnson Administration this week as it appears the President has failed on his promise of enforcing Civil Rights and desegregation rules across the country. A report from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare which leaked last Friday claimed that thousands of businesses and private entities across America, particularly in the South, are refusing to bow to desegregation rules. These businesses explicitly refused to take down their \"Whites Only\" signs. Noncompliant businesses such as these have so far not received any punishment or legal repercussions.\n\nMany progressives in Congress have now declared that they will no longer stand behind the Johnson Administration for its inaction on this issue. In fact, several have declared themselves aligned with the Marxist wing of the National Progressive Pact. So far, President Johnson has yet to comment on this exodus of progressive politicians from his side, and it appears as though he will not take action against the law-breaking entities that have refused to accept the Civil Rights Act."

 LBJ.60.t: "Those to Include"
 LBJ.60.desc: "Lyndon Baines Johnson sat in the Oval Office, the rare pleasure of pure, unabashed silence consuming the room. Paper after paper, meeting after meeting: the day had been a long one, and the Sun was just now caressing the western horizon. Suddenly, the door creaked open, and through it entered Vice President Edmund Muskie; the two proposals for a new immigration bill had been finally finished. \"Republican written,\" said Muskie, placing the one down in front of Johnson. \"Democrat written,\" he said, placing the other.\n\nJohnson exchanged no words with Muskie; he simply sat, scanning his eyes through the Republican written immigration bill. It was very long, very thorough, and very restrictive. Immigration quotas would be increased, but upheld; travel to the United States from Germany and Japan would remain heavily restricted; and it would only slightly lessen requirements on applying for a visa. In short, it was extremely conservative, as he expected it to be. Technically, it wasn't even totally written by Republicans- the Southern Democrats had a part in writing it as well- but the Republicans always did have a tendency to drown out others.\n\nNext, Johnson flipped through the Democratic proposal. At this point, it was just a rough draft- still subject to significant future revision- but the groundwork and basic contents were there. Johnson found it to be much more amiable to his plans than the previous one. If implemented, the bill would remove immigration quotas entirely; open up travel to and from Germany, Japan, and other foreign powers; and generally lessen restrictions on entering the United States, which have been very strict since the end of the Second World War.\n\n\"Which one are we gonna move forward with?\" asked Edmund Muskie. \"If we go ahead with the Republican proposal, we'll probably garner some more votes with it, so it's more assured. Our proposal, on the other hand, is much more in-line with our policies and campaign promises, but it'll be harder to push through Congress and the Republicans will consider it a slap in the face.\""

The large vessel passed by Ellis Island, a mighty woman with a torch watching over the bay: Lady Liberty. This was everything Hans had ever hoped for and more. As Germany had fallen to pieces around him, he fled from his university dormitory to Denmark, and then to Scotland. For more than a year he had bided his time in Scotland, struggling to learn English, drifting from job to job, and desperately seeking an entry visa into the United States.\n\nHans' wish finally came true with President Lyndon Johnson's new immigration bill, which, after decades of hostility, allowed German nationals to enter the United States. Of course, one still had to obtain a visa, but no longer was travel to America limited to the rich or the powerful in Germany; now, even poor little Hans could pop onto a ship to a new world for a new life.\n\nThe barge was reeled into port on the north side of Manhattan. Walking down the plank onto the concrete dock, the Hudson River at his back, and the wind in his hair, he had finally arrived. America! The stench of ocean salt and garbage and industrial pollutants dominated the air, but Hans could care less. It was less the smell of refuse and more the taste of liberty.\n\n\"Hey, you!\"\n\nHans turned around to see a greasy-looking dock worker with jet black hair and a distinct accent talking to him. \"Ya just gonna stand there or can we gets to work unloadin' this boat?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied Hans in his thickly-accented English, \"I just arrived from... Sweden. My name is John.\"\n\nThe man looked over him, a pensive look in his eye. \"Well, John the Swede, I'll need a few more hands on the docks soon. How'd youse like a job workin' for me?\"\n\nHans looked out over the massive hive of humanity called Manhattan. So much was different and new and breathtaking: the Empire State Building; jet planes flying far overhead; the hustle and bustle of the living, breathing city of New York. He had finally made it."

Right now, though, he'd have to sit in the Oval Office and take it. Syd wasn't the only Democrat pissed over the contents of the new immigration bill, but goddamn was he loud.\n\n\"My district already has plenty of illiterate foreigners and infiltrators, so we sure as shit don't need more!

 LBJ.80.t: "Establishing the \"Head Start\" Programs"
 LBJ.80.desc: "To achieve his dream of eradicating poverty, President Johnson has established the Head Start Program. This initiative, under the auspices of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, is just the first of what is hoped to be many by the Johnson administration, in an effort to improve the plight of young children in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods -- and particularly those of minority groups.\n\nHead Start offers summer programs and evaluations to ensure that children from low-income families succeed in adjusting to elementary education, and are sufficiently developed, cognitively speaking, in order to succeed in school.\n\nOpposition from conservative circles has been somewhat muted, partially due to the fact that popular support for Head Start is fairly high. More vocal opposition to further encroachment on the states' prerogatives of education will only mount should the administration choose to move that way."
 LBJ.80.a: "These are just the first steps."
 LBJ.81.t: "Assessment of the Teachers' Unions"
 LBJ.81.desc: "One of the planned landmark pieces of legislation President Johnson hopes to pass is the so-called Elementary and Secondary Education Act. While the draft is still rough, ESEA will increase federal funding to schools across the board, as well as focus on parental involvement in public education. While his allies in Congress craft the bill itself and marshal congressional support to ensure its easy passage, the President himself has elected to meet with the most powerful teachers' unions in the country to ensure their support for his newest initiatives.\n\nOne of the most notable demands with the unions is to relax federal control over the methods by which teachers may engage with students and teach coursework in the classroom. There has already been some strong opposition to such a proposal, as it may allow \"dissident\" and \"un-American\" ideas to proliferate among young children and teenagers in our schools. Furthermore, promising such a reform may weaken our support among conservative Republicans and the staunchest anti-communists and anti-fascists. Others, however, posit that it may be a new radical step in allowing personalization of education, tailored toward the individual needs of students, and may overall improve the quality of education of our young people."
 LBJ.81.a: "Reform in education is part and parcel to establishing the Great Society."
 LBJ.81.b: "Perhaps we shouldn't go too far."
 LBJ.82.t: "Complaints of Federal Overreach"
 LBJ.82.desc: "Though Head Start has proven pretty popular among both the general populace and among policymakers at every level of government, President Johnson has come under increasing assault by conservatives -- many even within his own party -- that accuse him of tyranny for having overstepped his bounds for his plans to greatly expand the mandate and scope of the federal government.\n\nSeveral southern governors, backed by their state legislatures, and supported by numerous federal Congressmen, have demanded that the President guarantee certain privileges in education that will belong to the states and the states only, in an effort to stem the tide of what they have termed \"increasing federal overreach bordering on federal tyranny.\" The President's supporters, as well as northern liberals, have urged Johnson to push forward in his program, criticism be damned.\n\nThus, determined as ever, President Johnson has continued to forge ahead on his legislative agenda. The Southern Democrats, and conservatives generally within the party, are none too pleased."
 LBJ.82.a: "Petty squabbling cannot be allowed to stem the tide of progress."
 LBJ.83.t: "Material Provisions"
 LBJ.83.desc: "The final stages of debate surrounding ESEA have begun: how much money should be committed to the program? The growing coalition of conservatives who find themselves increasingly opposed to the President's education policies have requested a more watered-down appropriations commitment in the bill. Lessening the strain on the federal budget can allow for improved budgets for the Department of Defense, or simply stave off any risk of budgetary default in the future.\n\nThe President's allies in the Congress believe it is wholly likely for the bill to pass even with a stronger financial commitment to primary and secondary education. The question is whether the President wishes to further strain his relations with the powerful conservative lobby within his party.\n\nFor Johnson's part, he would sooner scatter the most virulent opponents to his agenda to the four winds. But, as Johnson learned in all his years in the Senate, sometimes, in politics, other considerations must be made."

 LBJ.84.desc: "Rain fell down in great sheets over Washington. \"Lyndon, I cannot, in good conscience, allow this bill.\"\n\nPresident Johnson's hands were in his pockets, his gaze out on the South Lawn. A peal of thunder in the distance briefly overwhelmed the soft patter of rain on the windows of the Oval Office. Senator Russell was here again, voicing his concerns over the administration's agenda. \"With all respect, Lyndon, you must take care to respect the wishes of those constituents throughout the South -- and not just mine in Georgia. A great number of good people do not think dumping millions into this program will do much to improve the welfare of these negro children--\"\n\nJohnson suddenly drew himself up, his eyes alight. He snapped on his heels and briskly walked up to Russell, planting himself right in front of him. Their noses were an inch apart; the buttons on their jackets were touching. His voice boomed. \"Senator, I do not give a rat's ass about those damn constituents! I have not met with every member of the Congress, held meetings with twenty teachers' unions across the entire country, crafting this bill to perfection -- just to be told 'no' by a few bigots voting for a party to which I owe no allegiance!\" Russell froze, his lips tight, his eyes staring into the President's. There was a moment of silence. Calmly, Johnson continued. \"Senator, I would ask you kindly to relay to your colleagues that my position on this is final. That is all.\"\n\n\"Okay, Lyndon. As you wish.\" Johnson turned back around, walking past the Resolute Desk, again staring back out the rain-drenched window.\n\n\"And you will address me as Mister President.\""

 LBJ.94.t: "妥協案"
 LBJ.94.desc: "After days and weeks of intensive negotiations over the proposed Social Security Expansion Act, enough Republican lawmakers have been convinced to support a \"Compromise draft\" for the rest to fall in line. This piece of legislation, while broadly similar to the unmodified bill, contains changes that narrow its scope somewhat. Payments have been reduced across all programs, provisions put in to make sure information about the programs reaches all eligible citizens have been gutted, and the clauses on Family Assistance have been rewritten to apply only to married couples. Many in the administration believe the \"Compromise draft\" as written amounts to an exclusion of some of the people in most dire need of assistance. Still, its passage has the potential to be a major victory for President Johnson and his choice to emphasize party unity on the matter.\n\nThere is, however, another price to be paid. A source of great consternation among the Republican wing must be removed. The President must sever his alliance with \"Scoop\" Jackson and the Progressives. The administrations have sent out feelers for possible alternative compromises, but all their suggestions have been rejected. The Republicans have made up their minds, and no amount of further negotiation, backroom dealing, appeals to party unity or outright bullying tactics will change them.\n\nThe President has a choice to make."

 LBJ.95.t: "Hopes Dashed"
 LBJ.95.desc: "The end of the short-lived alliance between President Johnson and \"Scoop\" Jackson is the topic of every conversation in the National Progressive Pact, and will likely continue to be for some time. Jackson had staked a lot of prestige on their association, which had been considered a major victory within the party, proof of their ability to influence policy making on the highest level.\n\nThe Progressives' leadership had hoped they would now act as a counterweight to the conservative wing of the RDC, and that they could leverage that position to make policy gains. The passage of a substantial Social Security Expansion Act would be a crowning achievement, ushering a new era for the country and securing the Progressives a seat at the table for the foreseeable future. When the President chose instead to cave to the demands of that very same conservative wing and end his association with Jackson, and then to pass a watered down bill, it felt to many in the party like they were relegated, again, to the sidelines.\n\nJackson's disappointment was plain to all when he publicly decried the Compromise Bill as \"a victim, in my opinion, of putting party before country\", which \"denies support and opportunity to those Americans most in need of it\". This gloominess does not extend, however, to the Nationalist faction, whose lawmakers have made their approval of the revisions in the bill no secret. Their celebratory mood is beginning to give rise to considerable resentment in the rest of the party, once again calling into question the viability of an alliance between such a strange set of bedfellows."

 LBJ.96.t: "Toeing the Party Line"
 LBJ.96.desc: "No-one in the White House or the Halls of Congress could avoid sensing the recent shift in atmosphere. Relations between the main wings of the Republican-Democratic Coalition are at a low, with accusations of putting personal agendas ahead of party unity and stability abounding behind closed doors, and a relationship that was never warm in the first place is cooling further.\n\nThe latest fault-line is the passage of the Social Security Expansion Act, which is clearly more important to the President than keeping the Republican wing of his party content. Great effort has been expended in recruiting every supporter of the Act in pressuring, badgering and bullying its detractors into submission. Most of the Republican lawmakers have fallen in line, seemingly judging that they still have too much to lose if they publicly speak out against their coalition.\n\nFor many Republican voters, however, this is taken as another instance of the Democratic wing happily taking their votes while ignoring their interests, feeding a growing sense of disenfranchisement with the party. Also feeding that sense are the firebrands of the Nationalists, who are finding a waiting audience for their condemnations of \"the Socialist-in-Chief\" and his \"attacks on the white working man of America\"."

 LBJ.97.t: "The Progressives Show Their Support"
 LBJ.97.desc: "While facing opposition in his own party, President Johnson's all-or-nothing approach to the Social Security Expansion Act has found a source of support outside it: The Centrist faction of the National Progressive Pact. Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson has spoken warmly of the bill on multiple occasions, and this morning he contacted the administration on behalf of a group of senators from the Progressives. They are pledging their votes to ensure the passing of the Social Security Expansion Act in its current, comprehensive state.\n\nPresident Johnson is hailing their support as proof of the broad appeal of the Act and an important victory for the Great Society. Jackson, on his part, explains his support of the Act and willingness to cross the aisle to pass it as proof of his \"commitment to America and the welfare of the common man.\""
 LBJ.97.a: "We wish their votes welcome"
 LBJ.98.t: "A Win for the Alliance"
 LBJ.98.desc: "Ensuring the passage of the Social Security Expansion Act would be a major test for President Johnson and the strength of his alliance with the Progressives. A test, it appears, they have now passed. The Act passed through congress without major revision, and will cast a strong, wide, social security net for Americans for years to come. Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson has hailed the bill as a \"triumph of bipartisan cooperation\" and \"a great victory for the people of the United States\".\n\nWithin the RDC, it is very clear now that President Johnson's progressives are in the ascendancy, with conversations and planning focusing almost exclusively on how to build on their recent victory and little energy being spent on soothing ruffled feathers or bringing the Republican wing back into the conversation. Among Republican senators, a sense of unease is growing as they find the centre of gravity in the coalition moving further and further away from them, with little opportunity to correct its course lest they be cut off from decision-making entirely. This unease extends to their voters. In traditional Republican strongholds, many are questioning their commitment to a coalition that they increasingly find themselves at the margins of."

And good news: the overwhelming majority of Americans support our efforts to reform society to make it more equal and fair for those on the bottom of the totem pole. But as our efforts bear fruit in Congress, there are already rumbles of opposition building. Some conservatives in the Republican wing of the coaliton, as well as the Nationalists, are starting to complain in private, and there are anonymous op-eds in newspapers all over the nation denouncing the efforts.\n\nThere is really nothing to be worried about now: most of these people would never have voted for the Great Society anyway if it wasn't political suicide to support the first acts that are generally popular with the American people. The few that did vote against these acts did so on grounds of high cost, and the encroachment into the state's prerogatives, and not necessarily in regard to the ideas themselves.\n\nIn general, our plans are moving ahead, and still have wide support, so we should be able to continue pushing forward to make America a better, more equal nation."

In general, the people are with us, and Congress, including the RDC and much of the NPP, are still supportive, so we can expect the bipartisan support needed to get more through.\n\nThat said, some of the more conservative and moderate members of the Republican-Democrats are talking to staffers on Capitol Hill, and are feeling like we've already done a good job, and should maybe start winding down the Great Society. One Senator even said that we've done enough for this decade, and should let the next generation get a chance to do some stuff!\n\nWhile no one is breaking away and refusing to go along, we will most likely start seeing more resistance from the Republicans, and even some of the conservative Democrats, who believe that the Great Society has gone far enough. Any further Great Society acts could start arousing concerns of everything they like to worry about, like tax hikes, debt, socialism, and states' rights. So we should take this into consideration as we go forward."

Some Republicans voted against the last bill, some of those conservatives that like \"small government\" and \"pulling yourself up by your bootstraps\" and all that. While it wasn't enough to threaten the passing of these laws, it does mean that future laws will most likely require that we work with the Progressive faction of the NPP to ensure that we have enough support to pass through an increasingly divided Congress.\n\nYou should know as well as I do that this could be a problem: the Republican-Democrats were formed to keep the peace and stability of America first and foremost. If the RDC breaks apart, that can lead to much greater crisis and chaos in the future..."

This will, of course, be a great success for the Administration, and help many Americans that need it most.\n\nThe bad news, however, is that the Republican-Democratic Coalition is starting to break. Many of the right-leaning Republicans are openly starting to back away from you and the coalition, denouncing our efforts as centralizing the government and \"Bolshevism.\" Some congressmen are even crossing the aisle to the NPP. While most of them didn't like the Great Society in general, their leaving deals a blow to make your policies seem, at least on the surface, somewhat bipartisan.\n\nOn top of that, now the Republicans are starting to warm to the whole Great Society, but are starting to push us to go even further, make the plans more ambitious. They are really starting to sound like Harrington, or [GetRFKOrJackson]...\n\nHey now, don't throw that pen at me! I know you don't like [GetRFKOrJackson], but take it up with the Republicans.

But those numbers are just barely above the majority, and we are facing an internal political maelstrom: The Republican-Democratic Coalition is crumbling as we speak. Already, several big named Republicans have denounced us, and are crossing over to the Nationalists. This is really not good: if the RDC breaks up, then the Democratic Party that is left will never win another election.\n\nYou must understand, sir, that politics is my thing. I'm here to tell you what is and what isn't good for your political standing. I know the Great Society is great for America, and I will do what I can to get it passed. But with the party buckling, and the sides getting more partisan and restless, I don't know how much more I can do within the party.\n\nWe are going to have to rely on the moderates of the Democratic Party and Progressives to keep passing Great Society legislation, which should be enough to get it through Congress.

For the first time, a majority of respondents are saying that they are feeling unsure about the cost of the Great Society. Fears that have been stoked by the Republicans and the Nationalists about higher taxes and more government control of their lives are starting to filter through the public. While the numbers of people who support the Great Society overall are still strong, we should be prepared to face growing backlash as we expand it.\n\nThere are commentators and political scientists that are talking increasingly of the new polarization of American society, all revolving around your plans, with progressives on the left pushing to go even further than the Administration wants, and conservatives on the right who are demanding a halt to the growth of government power and interference in the lives of citizens and undermining states' rights, and people in the middle who are tired of both extremes.\n\nThis is especially evident on the West Coast: while a majority were supportive of the Great Society at the beginning, now support is dropping, and dropping a lot quicker than in other places, namely about the cost. This is only going to get stronger, divide more Americans, and lead to a virtual breakdown of society into an \"us vs. them\" mentality that will make it even harder to pass further laws."

The Progressive faction of the NPP has proved to be a strong ally, even as the conservative Republicans flee to the Nationalists. As the Democrats who are left in the RDC lean more progressive, we are actually lining up with the Progressives on many social and economic issues, which should help make the Great Society legislation easier to pass and promote.\n\nOf course, there are going to be issues with working with the Progressives: they are much more established leftists and progressives than most Democrats, so the future proposals will lean even more toward them, and bolster their own support in future elections. There are even some Republicans calling you the first NPP President as we continue to work with them.\n\nPolitics has always made for strange bedfellows, and working with some of the folks on the other side of the aisle is, well, strange and discomforting at times. But at least working with Michael Harrington and Scoop Jackson is a lot easier, more pleasant, and less migraine inducing than with Barry Goldwater or Wallace Bennett. This will undoubtedly help us to get the Great Society pushed through the legislative branch easier, though in the end it may just destroy the RDC all together."

I know it's not a lot in the big scheme, they are still a tiny sliver of the electorate, and you can still point to general approval for the Great Society, but that right there should be worrying. Just that small number can make or break elections: just a few thousand votes in the right state can make all the difference.\n\nOh yes, and the other number: the Marxists are also gaining a boost too, and a fairly big one. As the rhetoric is ratcheting up, both opposed and in favor, those on the far left are seeing increasing support as well, seeking to get the Great Society to be even stronger and farther reaching. They are taking support from both the Republicans and even our allies in the Progressives.\n\nI really don't know what else to tell you. We are seeing the breakdown of the two party system as we've known it for the past two decades right in front of our eyes: the Republicans have defected, we are in bed with Harrington, and the nutcases on the extremes of the spectrum are looking better and better.\n\nMaybe we are pushing this too far?"

This is terrible. The \"Party of Stability\" is done. The RDC is virtually dead. An honest-to-god fascist is looking credible to a worrying large number of voters. The Marxists are pouncing at every opportunity to make us look like we are weak and not doing enough. Even our allies in Congress are exhausted and demoralized, and are ready to just give up, call it \"Mission Accomplished,\" and go home. And I can't blame them.\n\nWe have to wake up to reality here.

People's allegiances now are either in favor or opposed to The Great Society: there is almost nothing that unites certain people more than either supporting you wholeheartedly and will march with you all the way to Hell, or thinking you are the Anti-Christ, Satan himself reincarnated. But the largest section of the population are just... done. They are exhausted, tired, and tuning out anything political.\n\nThe Republicans are now part of the National Progressive Pact's Nationalist wing, while the more liberal Progressive wing is more or less left-wing Democrats. Yockey's and Hall's supporters have claimed the extremes, and there are fights, protests and riots breaking out almost daily between those that want to see one or the other sit where you are sitting now.\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact that we have passed almost the entire Great Society program, I'd be terrified of your chances to actually get anything done in how bitterly divided and partisan the whole nation has become.

Privately and ever more publicly, the President is being accused of putting his personal agenda before the Party and endangering the alliance at the core of the RDC.\n\nAcross the South and in their strongholds in the rest of the country, the Nationalist faction of the NPP is denouncing the expansion in even clearer terms. According to them, the Act is \"an overt attack on the American middle class\" and a \"subsidy paid to the negro by the white working man\". Their strategy appears to be to tie increased welfare and higher payments to the issue of civil rights, and according to reports trickling back to Washington, it seems to be working. Many previously Republican districts are beginning to lean NPP.\n\nThis morning the governing party was rocked by the news of a handful of lawmakers, including three senators, crossing the aisle and officially switching to the NPP.

Meanwhile, some Republicans are trying to save face, calling the move an unsanctioned and unsupported move within their party. They, at least, are a minority.\n\nStill this is undoubtedly good news for the administration and means we can move forward with this piece of legislation and further aspects of our agenda."
 LBJ.125.a: "Our ranks grow thicker."
 LBJ.126.t: "Paying the Piper"
 LBJ.126.desc: "Now that the shape of the Social Security Expansion Act is more or less settled, all that remains is to decide upon how to fund it. The projected cost of the programs is substantial, and there is no room to pay for it in the current budget. This means President Johnson and his administration have no other option than to enact new taxes.\n\nThere are two main camps within the administration. The first proposes a new tax on income specifically to support Social Security. While a new tax is never going to be a popular proposition, they believe they can make it easier to swallow for the electorate by framing it as an investment in their own retirement.\n\nThe second camp proposes a much wider tax reform. It contains changes to almost every system of tariffs, levies or taxes collected by the federal government, and the increase in revenue will leave us a lot of extra funding even after Social Security is provided for. This reform is certain to prove a very hard sell to the public, but the increase in funds gives the administration a lot of financial room to act going forward, and will all but guarantee we won't have to raise taxes again in the foreseeable future."
 LBJ.126.a: "The first option. We just need to fund Social Security"
 LBJ.126.b: "The second option. We need the money"
 LBJ.128.t: "Equality for All?"
 LBJ.128.desc: "It's been a stain on America's founding vision from the start, the outcome of the United States' original sin: that African Americans have been seen as inferior to the White man. Recent events in the South, where police officers have brutally assaulted a black man, which made the news across the nation, have pushed President Johnson and his allies in Congress to start putting together a program that will change the balance, to give racially oppressed minorities the rights that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution legally gives them, but for far too long has been ignored. This program would encourage business, academia, the civil service and others to hire more African Americans, as well as Indians, Latinos, Asians, and other minority groups to be more representative of the population as a whole.\n\nOf course, there are some that strongly disagree; claiming that the Black man is already equal in law, and that Civil Rights has gone too far, that this as yet unnamed program would make Blacks more powerful than whites. The opposition has coalesced around Francis Parker Yockey and his right wing supporters in the NPP, which has seen a boost in support in polls lately."
 LBJ.128.a: "The scales are only being tipped to make it more equal."
 LBJ.129.t: "Growing Socialism"
 LBJ.129.desc: "To some of our detractors, measures taken to implement the Great Society border on socialism. Yet to the Marxists, this is a good thing - and moreover, they're the ones responsible for it, by \"putting pressure on the Johnson Presidency to actually enact laws which will help the working class\". Not very convincing, but the Marxists are taking the credit anyway, and piggy backing on our success to grow their own movement."
 LBJ.129.a: "Is there really a place for socialism in America?"
 LBJ.130.t: "Working on Healthcare"
 LBJ.130.desc: "Rumors and leaks have been coming from the Administration that work toward the budget for a universal healthcare plan is currently ongoing. While the Press Secretary and the President himself won't say so officially, speculation is growing in Washington and around the country that soon the US will join virtually every other industrialized nation on the planet for a full and comprehensive medical insurance plan. While there is still a long way to go before the plan will be presented to the American people, and to convince a majority that it's in their best interest, the Marxist wing of the National Progressive Pact is already capitalizing on this outcome. Claiming that universal healthcare is thanks almost entirely to their pushing and continuing support, the Marxists have seen their support increase across the nation already."
 LBJ.130.a: "We haven't even finished putting it together yet!"
 LBJ.131.t: "Reluctant Republicans"
 LBJ.131.desc: "Whilst our administration has only acted in the best interest of the American people, we seem to have gone too far for some within our own party. A number of Republicans have publicly distanced themselves from some of our most recent measures, leading to a decline in support for the President from a segment of the electorate. Unfortunately, this weakens our ability to implement the change America needs."
 LBJ.131.a: "Ah, fuck 'em."
 LBJ.132.t: "偉大な社会"
 LBJ.132.desc: "1964年、リンドン・B・ジョンソンがホワイトハウスに入ったとき、彼はある約束を口にして執務室に入った。アメリカの家族と労働者を前に、神を証人とし、世界の縮図を目の当たりにしながら、大統領は食事をとれない子供も、学校に通わない子供もいない社会と、人種差別をなくし、病人を支える医療制度、子供たちが楽しめる環境を約束したのである。このような政策に対して、ジョンソン大統領は変革の敵となる人々にあらゆる方面から激しい批判を浴びせられた。しかし、大統領執務室の椅子が孤独になろうとも、彼はそれでも前に進み、偉大な社会を実現したと言えるのだ。\n\n公約達成をきっかけに、共和民主連合は珍しく結束が強まりつつある。しかし、これは束の間のことかもしれない。ジョンソンの政策を実行することによって、何百万人ものRDCの元有権者が離反した。彼らはNPPのデマゴーグと我々の政策に対するNPPの絶え間ない攻撃に魅了されているのだ。我ら自身の党の結束は、ジョンソンの政策によって大きく歪められ、再選を勝ち取るのは困難となっている。だが神に誓って我々が達成した事がある。我々はアメリカ国民に、ここ数十年彼らが見たことのない希望を与えたのだ。そして、それは何があろうと大きな価値があるのだ。"
 LBJ.132.a: "世界一偉大なこの国のための偉大な社会だ。"
 LBJ.134.t: "会談"
 LBJ.134.desc: "President Johnson sat nervously during the entire meeting. Even with the gulf in political power between the two men, Johnson took on a humble and reserved tone when speaking to Martin Luther King Jr. President Johnson explained that he was eager to continue the struggle for Civil Rights and build upon the success of his Voting Rights Act. He said that Rev. King could tell his community that they have no greater friend in the fight for racial equality.\n\n\"Indeed, we do not,\" Rev. King replied, \"and the VRA was a true boon to our community's ability to make their voices heard at the polls. You can count on our support, Mr. President. Yet there's far more work that needs to be done than you may realize. Writing a few laws is easy, but solving the entrenched social inequality that the Black community faces in this country cannot be accomplished without fighting against the endemic poverty we face. The evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism are all tied together... you can't really get rid of one without getting rid of the others... the whole structure of American life must be changed.\"\n\nRev. King continued, \"You can't talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You're really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism. If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God's children to have the basic necessities of life, she too will go to hell.\"\n\nPresident Johnson was guarded in his response, saying that he was committed to fighting the War on Poverty as a key plank of his Great Society program. The President thanked MLK for all his support and the meeting concluded cordially."
 LBJ.134.a: "How great can the Great Society become?"
 LBJ.135.t: "黒人票の獲得"
 LBJ.135.desc: "The Republican-Democrats have accomplished one of the most monumental feats in social American history with the passing of the Voting Rights Act. Not only are the African Americans unimpeded on their way to vote, but they are now actively flocking to the polls, greatly increasing the voter turnout. The surge of African American votes is spread throughout the South, not only in the major cities of Birmingham, Atlanta, or Houston, but also in the smaller cities of Little Rock, Jacksonville, Biloxi. The population was even gaining ground in the poor rural areas of Central Alabama and the outskirts of the huge Georgia cities.\n\nBut Lyndon B. Johnson was hard at work today. It was inevitable that with proper representation, African Americans would go to the polls in huge numbers to show support for the party of their choosing. If Johnson could garner the African American vote, it is possible that the RDC could become the dominant political bloc in the South, displacing the NPP menace. This vote would make up for all the Dixiecrats that quickly deserted the party once the act was passed. Time was of the essence for President Johnson as he began to dial up activists, church leaders, professors all throughout the Deep South, starting with Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia..."
 LBJ.135.a: "We need the African Americans on our side!"
 LBJ.136.t: "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.136.desc: "\"Now, I know that things haven't been going our way since we were first brought to America centuries ago. We suffered under the lash for years and years, not just in the United States, but throughout the entire continent. It was by the will of Abraham Lincoln and by the grace of God that our chains were finally broken. We had some success in American culture; we had Frederick Douglass, we had George Washington Carver, we had Rosa Parks. These people worked to put us in the spotlight. My fellow African Americans, though we still face prejudice, our words now matter. Our vote finally matters. Our lives finally matter.\"\n\n\"Do you know who made this happen? The Democratic Party worked day and night to give us this opportunity. Our great President Johnson needs our help more than ever. He worked to give us the proper right to vote, he stopped every oppressive state that tried to lay a hand on us. I say we give back to him, to the Democratic Party. If you haven't realized yet, my friends, we need them too. We will accept the President's Great Society with open arms.\"\n\nAfter several months of campaigning, the Democratic Party started to win over some well-known activists to President Johnson's cause. These activists, in turn, reached out to the multitudes of African Americans in the South, persuading them to use their new vote for the party. While some progress has been made down South among the new black voters, there is still a long way to go before the Democrats could ever become relevant again in the region."
 LBJ.136.a: "At least we're making progress."
 LBJ.137.t: "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.137.desc: "\"Look how the world around us is changing with President Johnson at the helm. We've been given the incredible voting privilege that has eluded us countless times in the past. Our poorer blacks in the South are more likely to afford cheap housing thanks to President Johnson's Fair Housing Act. The schools for our black children are being given more funds, and they are being recognized for their academic achievements. Our older blacks are receiving the care they so desperately need thanks to the new Medicare program. Folks, I see a lot of potential with the Democratic Party after looking around at the Great Society we are living in. If we keep voting Democrat, I believe all American lives will get better and better.\"\n\nOur campaigning is proving to be very successful at gaining the African American vote in the South. The more activists we influence, the more momentum we gather to topple the traditional parties that have dominated the South for decades. We have noted a substantial increase in popularity among blacks in poorer regions, which can only mean that our Great Society is working.\n\nOur campaign has shown some slight flaws: our hardcore traditional whites have started to denounce our platform, claiming that we are \"ceding too much to the blacks\", but this would come naturally with the addition of new party voters. The issue should not gather enough support to put a dent in our party, but it is something to monitor. Nevertheless, every black voter who once faced oppression at the booth now prepares to defend their newly-given vote with all they have. Our reforms are truly reaching out to all Americans."
 LBJ.137.a: "Even more support from the African American community."
 LBJ.138.t: "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.138.desc: "\"Now we have a choice in this next election. We can go with the Democrats, who keep backing us up and will have our back until the end of time, or we can choose the radicals in the NPP who want to tear this country apart and go back to square one. Ultimately it's your choice. But I believe the Democratic Party is the right choice to help our country move forward. And with your votes, my brothers and sisters, we will continue the changes that have brought many of us hope and prosperity.\"\n\nNew polls keep coming in from government agencies, and we are starting to see a rise in popularity the likes of which we have never seen before. It is very likely that with the African American vote, we can turn the South around completely. Even in states like Alabama and South Carolina, where the Democratic votes were few and far between, we have started to gain tremendous ground thanks to the large African American populations in these states. However, it would be a lie to say that these states will totally support the Democrats in the next election; already, many conservative white Americans are expressing their clear disapproval, and they are quickly ditching our party in favor of the dreaded alternative. Our wonderful activists will do more than make up the losses our party suffered, and with their help, we have already gained so many more African Americans to our side. If we keep pushing for change, we will have the entire South in our grasp in no time."
 LBJ.138.a: "Awesome"
 LBJ.139.t: "A Dream More Than Dreamt!"
 LBJ.139.desc: "We put so much effort into passing the reforms that led to President Johnson's \"Great Society\" and we are finally starting to reap the fruits of our labor. At the end of the day, our carefully-planned policies and our wonderful campaigns have given us a competitive voter base in even the most Conservative regions of the nation. We owe it all to the brave activists that preached our party to the masses of African Americans across the South. We owe it all to President Johnson's government who worked tirelessly to pass legislation that would benefit all Americans regardless of race.\n\nEven now, our work is far from over. Racism is still a widespread issue, and prejudice against Democrats continues as it has since the start of Reconstruction. More white voters have deserted the party during this campaign; in fact, we've lost almost every Dixiecrat member to the NPP. Even with the Democratic unity among African Americans, division between blacks and whites is even more apparent.\n\nRegardless, President Johnson's Great Society has improved American healthcare, education, civil rights, and many other important parts of daily life. There is no doubt that the Democratic Party will continue gaining lifetime supporters as a result of Lyndon Johnson's successes. Our activists, now working as full-fledged members of the Democratic Party, will continue promoting the party that has already helped so many Americans through Johnson's plan."
 LBJ.139.a: "The future is bright for the revitalized Democrats."
 LBJ.140.t: "Price of Expedience"
 LBJ.140.desc: "The good faith among African Americans engendered by President Johnson's attempt to pass substantial housing access reform has been poisoned by his surrender on the issue. Democrats blatant political reversal on the issue is a spit in the face to the constituency. The high minded rhetoric that preceded it just makes the betrayal sting all the more.\n\nCivil rights leaders are denouncing the President and his party in the strongest language, and editorials on the failure of the RDC to address civil rights are flying. Pundits of all stripes are predicting the black vote moving towards the NPP. Progressives in that party are taking full advantage of the beating the Democrats are taking, proposing more aggressive national policies to combat discrimination in housing, employment, and education."
 LBJ.140.a: "There goes that bloc."
 LBJ.141.t: "英雄じゃない"
 LBJ.141.desc: "President Johnson's weak Fair Housing Act is making many Democratic African Americans question their allegiances. It's hard to see more than squandered opportunity in the bill that was passed. It's becoming clear to many that Democrats won't sacrifice moderate white votes by strongly pursuing civil rights. President Johnson's credibility as an ally, established by his support for voting rights, has taken a nosedive.\n\nThese developments will hurt the RDC in the South, where black support for their candidates was crucial in holding back Nationalist challengers. It will take stronger efforts on behalf of their rights to repair the relationship with black voters."
 LBJ.141.a: "We'll weather this, somehow."
 LBJ.143.t: "Photogenic"
 LBJ.143.desc: "2 PM in the congressional cafeteria. Barry and Lyndon sat together at a table, enjoying the meal of the day and just chatting about whatever came to their mind. It was marked as a political meeting in their calendars, the opportunity to push their agendas through backroom deals, but both of them knew that this wasn't the real reason for their biweekly meetings. Even the greatest politicians need to slack off with their fellow colleagues once in a while.\n\n\"...and I completely agree with you on this point, Lyndon, the pizza served here is laughably bad. Anyways, can we reschedule our next meeting? I've booked a holiday trip in Arizona, so I'll be away for the week.\"\n\n\"You're taking a vacation? Barry, that's the first time I've seen you take a vacation in years. Jeez, what happened? I always thought that you were too uptight to ever take your mind off work for a few days.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm doing a little photography tour through Phoenix. The city is just marvellous at this time of the year. Seeing Saint Mary's Basilica at night leaves an impression that will stick with you for years.\"\n\n\"Sounds fantastic. I didn't know that you went back to photography, didn't you abandon the hobby a few years ago?\"\n\n\"Back then, I felt like I ran out of motives for my photos, y'know. Every major city was just suffocating under this impenetrably thick and grey blanket of smog. The Phoenix from my childhood memories, the bright and vibrant gem of the Sun Belt, simply didn't match up with what my pictures showed, so I quit under the belief that I was just not skilled enough to reveal the true beauty of the place. That's what I thought, anyways. However, the past few years have been nothing short of a miracle. The air is slowly clearing, the once barren ponds are gradually getting repopulated, and I believe that I even heard a songbird the other day, for the first time in a decade at least. These business bigwigs and northern NPP Nationalists might fight your environmental plan with everything they've got, but let me tell you - the results have been astonishing so far. A lot of your policies are nonsensical, but what you've done to the nature of our beautiful nation is something great that'll never be forgotten.\""

 LBJ.144.desc: "A great society manifests itself in the villages of Appalachia. Life is as calm and rural as it ever was, but the last vestiges of crushing poverty are slowly, but surely evaporating into nothingness. Dysentery, hookworms, goitres - all these symptoms of a life at the bottom - fade away, and nothing but the romanticized notion of a country lifestyle remains.\n\nA great society manifests itself in the halls of the Mercy hospital. Those without means are finally able to receive what they need the most, prophylaxis and treatments.\n\nA great society manifests itself in the streets of Harlem. Local residents, policemen, commuters and many more people rush through the streets of the borough eager to go about their day. The next generation dreams of the future, dreaming of a world where someone like them enters the Oval Office, an idea that was an absurdity a mere decade ago and now almost seems like an inevitably.\n\nA great society manifests itself in the schools of Chicago. Children of all ages and races play together, learn together, and grow together. Teachers, pens and book bags are taken for granted, and the times of need are almost entirely forgotten.\n\nA great society manifests itself in the wilderness of Alaska. Wild geese fly below the clear and starry sky. The vast landscape is near untouched, not a single piece of human refuse lies anywhere.\n\nA great society required a great investment. Taxes were expanded, businesses went insolvent, and a great deal of citizens opposed the project with everything they had, fearing the massive scope of Johnson's daring plan.\n\nBut when Lyndon Baines Johnson looks out the window of the Oval Office and sees what changed over the past few years, he is perfectly content with his achievements. Many doubted him when he announced his candidacy, claiming that he was a dreamer with unfeasible ideas who'd fall apart once confronted with reality These voices went silent, and only the history books remain."

 LBJ.145.desc: "\"President Johnson, sir, what happened? Are you alright?\"\n\nYolk dripped down the pants of the President. His formerly pristine suit was utterly ruined, as small pieces of eggshell were firmly lodged in the sticky malaise of egg-whites and cotton. Someone must have bombed the President, and despite the embarrassing circumstances, Johnson was lucky that it was an egg and not a grenade.\n\nThis silver lining did not improve Johnson's mood by any margin. He was as angry as a man could be, the angriest he has been in years, and all of his pent-up frustrations erupted in a profanity-laden rant vaguely directed at the closest person available - in this case, a random aide who happened to pass by.\n\n\"I've been had. I've been fucking had. One of these rioting blacks somehow got past the Secret Service - what a heap of useless jackasses - and threw an egg at me. He threw an egg at me! Holy shit, this is just an absolute disaster. The entire country is an absolute mess right now, I tell you that. You can't even take a walk without bumping into some inner city dweller holding a cardboard sign! Being egged isn't even the worst part of it - all these riots are seriously hurting my own position and the party at large. Most people don't give a damn about politics, they just want a peaceful life, and this dumpster fire is pretty much the exact opposite to that.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I definitely do care about the whole civil rights thing. It's a good policy, these people just don't understand that we had to delay it a bit due to our own internal issues. We need to properly communicate our difficulties, and we should get the whole thing started as soon as possible so these violent protests finally disperse. Jesus, I can't believe the whole thing got out of hand like this.\n\nYou know what? Call up some civil rights leaders and ask for a meeting. Screw my schedule, just pick the closest date you can.

Dozens of leaders from the black community were flown in from all over the country, and all of them had their own wishes, desires, concerns, and demands. Striking a deal with all of them would be a challenge, nearly impossible even considering the breadth and oftentimes contradictory nature of the goals of the leaders. Lyndon was set to try his best, but he was very much aware of his desperate position - it would take an immense amount of concessions to get most leaders on his side, concessions that are bound to tarnish his upcoming legacy. He had no option but to entertain even the most outrageous demands, and his guests were painfully aware of this fact.\n\nLongingly, Johnson thought of Martin Luther King. Negotiating with him would've been a breeze - he was one person with one ideology, and he still held more influence than all of his successors combined. If he were still present, all of this would have been so much easier, but fate just had to strike at the most unfortunate moment. Maybe he was too slow, maybe -\n\n\"Mr. President, are you alright?

 POLITICS_KIRK_DESC: "比較的リベラルでない考えを持つ政治家の多くはかつて、女性は軟弱すぎて大統領にはなれないと考えていた。つまり女性的優しさを持っているため弱い存在だということだ。今や愚か者や疑い深かった者たちは、ジーン・デュエイン・カークパトリック、すなわち鉄の心臓と政治精神を持った女のもとに尊敬と恐怖の念を抱きながら結集している。労働組合と対外介入の重要性の双方を生涯信じ続けたカークパトリックは、石油危機が深刻化するにつれて政治的に脚光を浴びるようになった。地政学に精通していることと、不退転の決意によって、彼女は大統領の座を比較的容易に勝ち得た。今、彼女は大統領として『カークパトリック・ドクトリン』と呼ばれるものを提唱している。それは、ナチスの全体主義の拡散を防ぐために、アメリカは自国に友好的な独裁国家を支援すべきだという地政学的訓示である。この概念は多くの人の反感を買っている一方で、目的達成の実効性を疑う人は少ない。\n\nオクラホマ出身のカークパトリックは、コロンビア大学に進学し、1968年に博士号を取得した後、アメリカ労働総同盟と民主党のメンバーとなり、外交政策に焦点を当てた歯に衣着せぬ発言で知られるようになり、主に内政を重視する同僚たちへの大きな対抗軸として作用した。\n\n今や、この現実的で計算高い鉄の女が大統領執務室に座っており、軟弱な国家を自分と同じような不屈の生命体へとゆっくり鍛え上げている。もし彼女の思い通りになれば、中央情報局の予算は急増し、親米的な第三世界の独裁者の数も同様に増えるだろう。世界の混沌とした風は、言葉を通してであれ剣を通してであれ、アメリカ合衆国を尊重し、恐れる秩序に切り替わるであろう。"

 hart.tree.2.desc: "The latest theater in Philip Hart's charm offensive was onboard the Presidential yacht Sequoia, where a night of scenic, liquor-lubricated sailing along the Potomac was poised to win the hearts of congressional Republican liberals. Hart knew from his Senate days that Liberal, \"Rockefeller,\" Republicans were the backbone of successful progressive legislation and figured that his amicable, even friendly, relationship with the likes of Hugh Scott and Jacob Javits would earn the new administration some favor. As the President introduced himself to the Georgetown socialites and upstate congressional types,\n\nPresident Hart introduced himself to the unspoken guest of honor, tapping the governor of New York to join him privately in the ship's foremost lounge. There, seated below the presidential seal and beside the vibrant image of Washington at night, Philip Hart and Nelson Rockefeller got to talking. \"You've given me hope about honesty in government, Mr. President,\" mused Rockefeller, nursing a drink, \"but I wouldn't count on the Coalition for votes.\" The teetotal President, enjoying a cream soda, returned, \"If I can't count on my parties for support, then it feels like we have bigger trouble.\"\n\nRockefeller smirked, if slightly, before resting on a placid grimace. The hard part. \"I represent several Republicans who say we do not entirely support your policy agenda. To be frank, Mr. President, if you want votes, you're not just a Democratic President. You're a Republican, too, and we've hedged our bets on your success. Until we know you're committed to that, I don't believe you will see much Republican support for the administration's policies.\"\n\nAs he parsed this exhortation, a nervous Philip Hart smile emerged on the President's face. Finally, he spoke up. \"You're... absolutely correct about the coalition. I won't let any of you down.\" Stunted by this rapid episode of political theater, Hart stood up and shook the governor's hand before returning to the party. So much for goodwill, silently mused Hart, who, for the first time, felt aware of the isolation that plagues Presidents. So much for friendship."

 hart.tree.3.desc: "\"Well, I hadn't considered that Jane, but I see it mentioned in this brief you sent me, and, uh...\" President Philip Hart thumbed through the paper stack briefing, mindful of the single paperclip keeping the immense document together. The Vice President watched from across the Resolute Desk as the President struggled against the file, painfully aware that Secretary Jacobs's phone call was cutting into his allotted meeting time. Hart continued, \"Yes, I will give some thought to his wealth question and get back to you. Or you could stop by the White House, fine. Okay.\" With that, the President finally placed down his phone and turned toward his guest with a smile. \"Hello, Chep!\"\n\n\"Hello, Mister President,\" returned the Vice President, who offered a meek smile of his own, \"I see the Secretary has gotten her materials to you first...\" He gestured towards the thick document bearing Health, Education, and Welfare letterhead on its title page, which the President readily handed over. Then, as Morrison skimmed the printed pages, Hart continued, saying, \"Yes, but I am equally interested in hearing your perspective, partially because I expect less reading.\" The two chuckled, and the Vice President pushed the packet aside.\n\n\"My first reaction is how dire these statistics are and how conveniently effective these... frankly, expensive, improvements will be to stop the problem of urban capital flight.\" If he had learned anything as Mayor of New Orleans, the Vice President stated, it was that there is power in a well-funded feasibility study. \"Conservatives will eat us alive with this data. Trust me on this, Mister President, good numbers get good results. That's a promise.\"\n\nThus, a dilemma was presented to President Hart: follow the advice of Secretary Jacobs and proceed with the HEW proposal, or heed the warning of the Vice President and settle any disputes with a study. Both options held merit. Proceeding as planned would result in a trimmed spending package, but the quick offensive could yield better policy. Following Morrison's advice would guarantee more broad support for the legislation and increase goodwill among Senate holdouts, at the cost of less effective legislation."

The cost projection was much higher than mere \"millions,\" but the President thought better of a correction. \"We're a superpower,\" fumed Jacobs, \"but we can't have both roads and railways. We can afford South Africa, but viaducts go too far?\" So she tossed her papers down with a whistling 'tsk' and seated herself on a nearby couch. \"Are they trying to make me mad?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the President said, straightening himself to soothe an activist's passion, \"I might make you mad too. I'm not going to fight the cuts.\" Secretary Jacobs chuckled and sighed, looking downcast as Hart continued. \"The department will still work; it's just a question of reductions, which we're navigating carefully.

 hart.tree.9.desc: "The Hart administration's transportation agenda was, to say the least, sweeping. It ordered expansions to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Transportation, including a hefty purse for construction and acquisition projects across the country. Wherever a new Bureau of Transportation building sprung up, jobs for road paving, laying rail, building overpasses, viaducts, underpasses, and tunnels, all at once in a thousand different places across the country. Federal money bought trains, buses, airplanes, station furnishings, employee salaries, and neat, new Amtrak-branded cups for drink service on every train. It was the most significant single investment in American infrastructure from top to bottom and touched nearly every decrepit hindering transportation in the United States. It was revolutionary, and that's why they hated it.\n\n\"They\" were the party bosses, ward healers, and blue-collar back-slappers that made politics happen in urban Democratic strongholds, and years of underhanded machine politics had crowned Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley as their king. \"He told me, 'The mayor needs political solvency,' and I think we both know what that means,\" explained Secretary of Commerce Mike Monroney, seated across from the President, who loosely masked his discontent. As Senator from Oklahoma, Monroney had thought little of the Democratic Chicago Mayor, but recent dispatches on the transportation issue had quickly soured his opinion. Mayor Daley's office had kindly informed Monroney that they needed an audit before offering their full support on account of the \"uncertainties\" a project like this brings. \"What is this?\" asked Hart bluntly, tossing the memorandum onto his desk, which recommended six months to audit the transportation initiative. \"Am I supposed to ask Congress for six months because he has doubts about our accounting?\" It was frustrating."

This transportation dreamland runs trains every five minutes, connecting stations and areas of public interest by bus lines at an even greater frequency, along roadways filled with affordable automobiles to serve the web's gaps. An investment into public transportation infrastructure is a payment toward American accessibility and delivers on the promise that the United States should be enjoyed by all its citizens.\n\n\"At least, that's the idea.\" President Phillip Hart stated, ending his impromptu lecture with a curt gesture. The speech's only audience, Vice President Chep Morrison, feigned applause with a chuckle before levying his response, barely telegraphing, \"My only concern would be the books-\" before the President slumped loudly back into his chair. After a brief, pregnant pause, the Vice President smirked and prodded, in a low voice, \"You don't think Secretary Jacobs has bugged the office, do you?\" No, replied the President, who smiled despite rolling his eyes. Morrison continued, \"Then what's the problem with some budget talk between us? If you're concerned about what to cut, take it out of our hands. Why not... poll it? See what the people want, and give us some breathing room.\" It seemed reasonable enough, thought Hart, and he leaned forward to grab his desk phone."

Suddenly, a shrill whistle let loose from Vice President Morrison's lips, and President Hart, Secretary Jacobs, and Secretary Monroney quickly turned to attention. \"You see this?\" The Vice President scoffed in disbelief, tossing his papers to the desk, \"Mr. President, you could bust GM, Ford, and Chevro-let tomorrow, and they'd love you for it!

He could also see an American breadwinner finally able to afford a family vehicle and enjoy all the blessings of personal mobility. The gravity of his suggestion dawned on the Vice President, and Chep was suddenly beside himself. \"Phi-er, Mr. President, you can't be serious!

When those doors shut, the President had instructed the White House staff shortly after the inauguration, with unusual sternness, they shouldn't open until morning. Still, the business found its way through the cracks, and President Hart was never truly free from work.\n\n\"Janey?\" called Philip Hart, stepping over a pile of shoes onto the staircase before craning his head to look up. A deep female voice returned, \"Mister President, I have a high priority communique for you,\" to which Philip groaned. He rounded the banister, loosening his tie, and met his wife with a kiss.\n\nMrs. Hart handed her husband a glass of water and began, \"Phil, dear, somehow during my day, I came into possession of this letter from Secretary McCarthy to...\" She slid the letter into his hand and tapped his chest, \"... his excellency, the President.\" Great, thought Philip, who shifted their embrace to tear the letter open, and he began to read aloud:\n\n\"Mr. President,\nI am writing to you regarding recent agriculture investments, which I strongly disagree with. American agriculture is a fragile ecosystem, and I am worried I have not done enough for the administration in this regard.\"\n\nPhilip murmured the rest of the letter to himself, finishing it and handing it to Janey. As she read it, Philip remarked, \"Well, I didn't think he felt so strongly.\" Indeed, the letter oozed with paranoia that seemed to come from nowhere. Janey nodded in agreement, adding, \"Maybe he's under pressure; why don't you invite him over?\" It had been a while since the Harts last kept company with a midwesterner, and the Secretary of Agriculture otherwise seemed an amicable fellow.

When the pioneers were spreading across the Great Plains, it was schools that served to anchor their communities! Urban \"nodes,\" according to my theories, that provide many essential services to their surroundings. Not just imparting knowledge on the next generation, but giving them a place to socialize and a shared experience that shapes their worldview! How can we address the deficiencies in our education without supporting our schools?\"\n\nPresident Hart nodded. \"Secretary Jacobs, I completely concur. For too long, we've allowed our schools to decay and our students to fall behind the other superpowers. We need new investments, not only to construct new schools in underserved communities in order to address inequality, but refurbish and revitalize existing schools. To make them the community centers you describe them else. To make them something America can take pride in!\"\n\nHart looked down at his desk, a feeling of weariness passing through him. As the battles over integration had shown, education was one of the thorniest issues in American politics. Many parents felt a strong sense of ownership over their schools and might object vigorously to any overreach by the federal government in that regard - not to mention the Constitutional issues that might arise in interfering with a domain traditionally left to the states. Still, he refused to give up on America's children."

If it isn't solvent then there's going to be fights over funding in Congress. There's going to be all kind of finger pointing and nasty business.\" The President looked down. \"What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Well, the way I see it, there's two options. The first one is that we keep the project running and hope that, some time in the future, this whole rigamarole becomes worth it. There's still gonna be costs but at least we can say we got this crazy idea off the ground.\"\n\n\"And the second?\"\n\n\"We cut our losses. We walk away from the Americar without spending any more money on it and move onto other ideas.

How can I help you?\" Said the President, gesturing for the chair in front of his desk. It was hard not to notice a pep in the Vice President's step, the return of a certain energy and enthusiasm that had been absent for many months.\n\n\"So I've been working on this whole Americar thing for some time, been crunching the numbers with the eggheads we got in the Office, you know...\" Chep began. Hart tried to resist the urge to raise an eyebrow at the man's obvious excitement. \"And, well, I don't have any words for it. It looks like the goddamn thing's solvent. It's making us more money than it's costing us. The American people are actually buying this goddamn car.\"\n\nNow, Hart really did raise his eyebrows. \"Really? You mean they're really...?\"\n\n\"I'd love to take credit for it all Philip, I really would, but you know as well as I do that I thought this was a cockamamie idea from the start. Somehow... somehow, this thing is looking like the biggest success since the Model T.\" Chep grinned.\n\nHart put down the briefing and turned in his chair toward the wall. Truth be told, even he had been skeptical of the Americar from the start. With the car making money and consumers happy, there would be no budget fights with Congress, no painful sacrifices. Thanks to his cabinet's ability to negotiate with the manufacturers, Philip Hart had proven just how powerful the federal government could be."

All of that, however, paled to the kind of abuse he now regularly received in the press.\n\n\"A HAIRY SITUATION IN WASHINGTON,\" read one headline in the Style section of the New York Times above a picture of the President's unshaven face. He turned the page of his daily press clippings, only to see a cartoon version of himself on the cover of TIME. The cartoon Hart leered through a scraggly, unkempt beard surrounded by hippies flashing peace signs. Philip Hart closed the folder in disgust and pushed it across the dinner table.\n\n\"Everything all right, Phil?\" said Janey, eyebrows raised. The First Couple sat together at breakfast, plates in front of them.\n\n\"I'm fine. It's...\" He glowered at the folder, half-hoping it might somehow catch fire. \"This beard. I thought I might change things up by not shaving for a few weeks and, hell, I don't know...\"\n\n\"Diana Vreeland at Vogue described it as very dashing. And besides, you've never been one to take fashion tips from the kinds of stuck-up fossils they employ at newspapers nowadays.\"\n\nPhilip scratched his beard. Janey was right but, still, he couldn't get the headlines out of his head. \"Do you like it?\"\n\nJaney looked up from her plate and stared at her husband for a long moment, inspecting him. Then she flashed her radiant smile. \"I'll have to agree with Ms. Vreeland on this one, Phil. It really does suit you. It makes you look distinguished.\""

He looked old.\n\nThe next day, Hart tried to move through the West Wing as if everything was normal, as if nothing had changed. Still, he could not avoid hearing the snap of the press's cameras. He could not help but see his aides do double takes as he walked by. Jane Jacobs, normally unflappable, had stopped frozen in her tracks as he passed. Even Chep, after pushing so hard, appeared slightly disheartened at the President's new appearance.\n\n\"Well,\" said Chep at the start of a meeting, with a look of forced cheer on his face. \"Good to finally see you again, Mr. President.

It was through sidewalks that the urbanite interacted with the city around him, with the quality of the sidewalk entirely a function of what was attached to it, be it a store, subway station or park.\n\nEven more interesting was Jacobs's concept of walkable sidewalks helping to prevent crime. It is a fact, after all, that criminals are less inclined to operate when in view of the public. Rather than rely on continual police presence, Jacobs asked, why not instead encourage a degree of passive societal surveillance through promoting walkable cities and streets? Through ensuring buildings faced roads and a neighborhood had plenty of watchful, disapproving eyes discouraging any ne'er do-wells. Hart put the book down.\n\n\"Arthur?

I believe I have, in my dear deLesseps.\" Zsa Zsa Gabor, the extravagant actress and socialite, crooned as she displayed her shining engagement and wedding rings to the attentive cameras and studio audience. The show host, a broad smile on his face, pretended to be interested. He had seen several wedding rings on Zsa Zsa over the years and showbusiness had made him cynical enough to doubt this relationship's longevity.\n\n\"And this lucky fellow, deLesseps Morrison, tell us more about him.\" He said, the studio audience chuckling a little at the odd name of Zsa Zsa's beau.\n\n\"Oh he's just perfect,\" Gabor said, her bright smile illuminating television screens nationwide, \"He's my ideal man. He has brains and he gives me my space, but he's still tough and decisive. You don't become a governor through being just a pretty face, though he's out of office at the moment. He knows I should be free like a bird in the sky, not kept in some golden cage to be paraded about.\"\n\n\"Well gosh, Zsa Zsa, it sounds like this marriage is an excellent fit for you.\" The host replied, his emphasis on 'this' drawing chuckles from the audience. They were familiar with Zsa Zsa's pattern and maybe this deLesseps Morrison would be the first to break it, but none of them would put any money on it.\n\n\"Now, it certainly is the most wonderful thing,\" Zsa Zsa said, her eyes glinting with mirth, \"And who knows? If things go wrong, perhaps I can add a governor's mansion to my collection. I am an excellent housekeeper after all.\" Laughter filled the studio as the audience recalled Zsa Zsa's string of favorable divorces, as well as imagining the actress pushing a former governor around."

No, you either inspire em' or scare the living hell out of em', and we didn't do either.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Phil, when those sonsofbitches up in the White House finish screwing the country in four years, somebody's got to pick up the pieces.\" Johnson paused. \"I don't envy you.

We won't be around forever.\" Johnson leaned in, the scent of scotch and cigar smoke wrinkling Hart's nose. \"And I know you don't think you're up for running. I should know; it takes a lot out of you. But politics is war, Phil. You've seen war.\"\n\nHart's arm twinged, the phantom of a German bullet too close to finding its mark. He'd gotten lucky. Too many others hadn't.\n\n\"Now, you take a minute and listen. I won't tell you what to believe or anything like that. You can keep your conscience. But, this country needs someone who can fight for the negro, the poor folk. Someone who'll make a place all those dead boys in Asia, and Africa, and England can be proud of.\" Johnson jabbed his finger at him. \"That someone is you, Phil. I'll help you get there. Make sure you're not gonna bend any goddamn knee to do it, not one, senator.

 hart.misc.10.desc: "It had barely been a week since Philip Hart won the 1968 Presidential election, and already he was swamped with phone calls from coy well-wishers and party animals seeking one favor or another. Now that he was President-elect, many within ruling the coalition mistook friendship as an inroad to power, and casual conversations were now full of not-so-subtle insinuations.\n\n\"Mr. Eastland told me about your trip...\" Richard Russell tapered off through the phone receiver, and Hart hoped he'd finally hang up. Then, the Georgia Senator dipped into a low voice, and said, \"By the way, Mr. President-elect, I thought I'd pass along my recommendation for Secretary of State.\" Philip palmed the phone and groaned. \"Senator Truman is a party man,\" Russell continued, \"and we know he's a fine statesman.\" Duly noted, thought Hart, who thanked the Senator for his call and hung up. No sooner had the call ended did the phone rattle again and, cursing his presidential ambitions, he snatched the receiver.\n\nAny anger faded when Hart heard his protege Ted Kennedy speaking through the wire, and he felt free to lament his frustrations about Russell's call. \"It must be that Georgia water,\" quipped Kennedy, who giggled through the phone, \"Atlanta's is a city of freaks.\" Their talk continued with critiques of Kennedy's policy, followed by honest heart-to-heart. Then, Ted erred and asked about cabinet appointments.\n\n\"The State Department-\" started Kennedy, but it was too late. Hart interjected, \"Ted, I've decided on Harry Truman for State. I think you'll find that agreeable, won't you?\" Hart couldn't believe it. Ted was his mentee; had the party gone so low as to recruit him for their pressure campaign, and had Kennedy been so unfaithful to accept the task?\n\nOblivious to tension across the phone, Kennedy huffed, \"A shame, I was hoping for someone like Cyrus Vance, but Truman's fine too. A classic.\" Color flushed from Hart's face, and he stammered idly, embarrassed for having doubted Kennedy. The conversation recovered, however, and stress about phone calls faded as the two talked the night away."

In fact, their soldiers are very much human, beholden to the same inaccurate approximations and superstitions that befall any one of us. This fact, if used correctly at key points of stress, can allow us to defeat our foes without firing a single bullet.\"\n\nHart leaned back in his seat, his eyes locked on the speaker. Who was this man, and how had he wandered onto the Armed Service Committee? Most military leaders were subdued and serious, excepting LeMay and a few other isolated madmen. Yet this Lansdale fellow was animated and bright, waving his hands and leaning on his podium like a mix of mad scientist and magician. He was also clearly well-versed on his material—his notes painted a detailed, if imaginative, portrait of the German psyche and its precise points of attack.\n\nHis monologue ended once some general interrupted with some banal questions of procedure. Whatever conversation continued from there was not worth following - clearly, the generals just wanted to tie Lansdale down. Hart waited for the session to end before getting up to speak with the Major-General directly.\n\n\"I really enjoyed your talk, General Lansdale. I think you've got a bright future ahead of you.\"\n\nLansdale seemed lost in thought. He kept his head down as he packed up his papers. \"These days, it doesn't feel like it.\" he said, his voice now forlorn."

The diagnosis throws into doubt his capacity to remain in Washington to serve his duties as President.\n\nDocuments obtained by sources in the White House indicate the diagnosis was made over a year ago by White House Physician James Young. During that period, the President participated in a variety of treatments, including surgery to remove \"tissue of concern\", at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Few were informed of the President's condition or treatment.\n\nHart, 62, long alarmed staff with his long absences from the White House over recent months. Though concealed in his public schedule as \"vacations\" to Camp David and his personal home in Michigan, over a dozen sources close to the President and the Cabinet indicate that these stories became increasingly difficult for them to accept. The White House was not immediately available to comment.\n\nMelanoma, which takes the form of dark, irregular lumps on the skin, is the most lethal form of skin cancer. If detected early, it can be treated, but if unaddressed the cancer can spread rapidly and prove fatal. When it has spread to other organs, such as the liver, most survive less than one year.\n\nThe development thrusts a spotlight on Vice President deLesseps Story \"Chep\" Morrison Sr. A former governor of Louisiana long derided for his relative conservatism and Washington inexperience, Morrison now stands as the likely next President of the United States..."

The New York financial crisis has gone from a tidal wave to a ripple and the city is nearly completely unscathed.\"\n\n\"Well I'm happy to hear the federal aid was of such assistance, Mr. Lindsay,\" Jacobs replied, \"The cost of the program was enormous given the number of exposed cities. The taxpayers will be handling the hefty bill and it limits our budget for other priorities.\"\n\n\"Madame Secretary,\" Lindsey replied, his voice suddenly serious, \"I agree the cost was high, but you must agree that any price was worth paying to avoid what you and I both know was coming. New York would have been on life-support, the regional, heck, even national economy could have taken nasty tumbles. The crime, the poverty, the education cuts, it would be a nightmare. You, and the feds, did the right thing here, and I, along with every New Yorker, thank you.\"\n\nSomewhat touched, Secretary Jacobs thanked the mayor for his call and hung up the phone, turning back to other matters at hand. This particular fire had been put out, but there still remained plenty of others smoldering."

Thank you for all of your help. I'll be declaring the city bankrupt tomorrow.\" His tone made clear the mix of fury, disgust, and sadness the New Yorker was feeling. Hart tried to keep him talking, to plan their next step, but the fight seemed to have gone out of the other man. The phone went dead and Hart held the receiver for some time before returning it, absorbing what had just happened.\n\nHis urban renewal policies had been well-intentioned and well-designed, but the cities had been greedy or incompetent. He shook his head, banishing those negative thoughts and trying to draw himself back towards a productive mindset. This would be a serious crisis, but New York had handled worse, hadn't it?\n\nIn the dark of the bedroom, great doubts plagued Philip Hart's mind. He had entered office with the brightest of aspirations and the plans to achieve them. Yet here he was, sleeping in luxury even as misery engulfed the most vulnerable of America's urban centers. Feeling sick to his stomach, he returned to bed and embraced Jane.\n\nWith his wife beside him, he felt a bit more certain of his position. In the morning, he would consult her and begin the process of dealing with this crisis. For now, however, he had to sleep despite the crisis gnawing at his mind."

This is not a city trying to dodge its responsibilities, but rather is one dealing with an impossible situation the only way left.\" Mayor John Lindsay maintained his composure as he read the statement, knowing this would cement him forever in history as the man who bankrupted New York City.\n\nAcross the country, eyes glued to new stations drew other conclusions. President Hart's grandiose plans, so complicated and so generous with taxpayer dollars, had laid America's greatest city low beneath a mountain of debt. Of course, the story of New York City's accumulation of debt was more complicated than a simple story blaming Philip Hart but the just-so story rang out across the land.\n\nIn Washington, the cabinet debated whether an emergency bailout of the city was still possible to avoid the worst effects. However, the party's conservatives were already vocally concerned about spending and the talk of expensive bailouts would have them heading for the exits.\n\nAs the story of New York's misery amid the bankruptcy spread across the country, other cities with climbing debt and ties to the URI found themselves concerned. If the debt crisis could lay mighty New York City low, how would Cincinnati or Milwaukee fare?

New York City had run up debt for some time and, even as it participated in URI, failed to slow spending growth in other areas. The municipal government was irresponsible and the Federal government does not hold their pursestrings.\"\n\n\"But the URI spending was a factor? Can other cities participating in the URI expect to face similar debt problems? Bankruptcy?\" Another newsman, this one from CBS jumped up to aid his colleague. Circling like sharks, the journalists seemed thrilled to pepper Jacobs with every sharp question they had.\n\n\"The administration is continuing to monitor the situation. If other cities have made similar financial errors or malfeasances, we may see the crisis spread...\" Even as she said the words, Jane Jacobs felt a hollowness. This was bureaucrat-speak and she was shoveling inoffensive sludge when she knew the truth.\n\nOther cities had unmanageable debts and would be entering crises similar to New York's soon.

I'm sorry to say that cities are backing away from participation in the URI.

Treasury Secretary George Smathers looked down at the table, unwilling to meet anyone's gaze or comment.\n\nEvery member of the cabinet knew the public largely blamed the Hart administration for the crisis, the link between the Urban Renewal Initiative and the city bankruptcies too strong of a link to deny even if the larger picture were more complicated. The program itself was now deeply unpopular and had scaled back operations to avoid drawing further controversy.\n\nThe URI abandoning its ambitious goals was perhaps the greatest victory of its conservative foes, Hart reflected as his cabinet debated around him. Now, the right had a toothless yet completely demonized scapegoat to tie around his administration's neck. He could feel the full scope of the failed initiative on his back, knowing it would dog him forever.\n\nAs the weight on his shoulders grew to be nearly unbearable, he reminded himself he still had good advisors and could still work to repair the damage done.

While most here seemed jubilant, these ones had different expressions. Some walked away stone-faced, with hardly a glance back. Others stood at a distance, occasionally shaking their heads while some looked at him with open disappointment. His skin crawled but he remained to rally the troops.\n\nAfter a bit more time with the staff, Hart excused himself and continued towards Jacobs' office. She looked surprised to see him when he entered.\n\n\"I'm honored by the spontaneous visit, Mr. President. What's the occasion?\"\n\n\"I was hoping to discuss the program adjustments that the Treasury Department had proposed.\" Jacobs nodded and the two discussed the program briefly, Jacobs content to let Hart direct the discussion.

He had even gotten his first kiss at a nearby street corner. He walked to work now, and as he'd gotten older he liked what he saw less and less.\n\nThe roads were crumbling, stores were closing down and every year a few more houses stayed empty. The cops seemed overwhelmed and he'd been woken by gunshots in the night several times, his children full of questions he hated having to answer.\n\nHe was a loyal Democrat and a union-man. He'd voted for President Hart but had come to deeply regret that choice. To his mind, the President's focus on 'equality' and 'urban relief' had left men like him to rot in the consequences.\n\nHe'd noticed things get worse when 'they''d started showing up. He was not personally a racist, but did 'they' have to move in on his street? His jaw tightened when he walked past the house every day. What kind of a neighborhood were his kids growing up in? Not the same one as him, that was for sure. There were certainly none of 'them' around here then.\n\nAnd so, after a brief discussion with his wife and a longer one with a realtor, a moving truck appeared outside his home, just as it had many other times in the area. With his savings and a loan from the bank, he settled on a bigger home in a suburb twenty minutes away.\n\nHe would miss walking to work and the memories of the old community, but he worried for his children. He wanted them safe and more comfortable than he had been. These were his justifications for his flight, but something still burned in him as he drove the moving truck away from his old home."

There were skyrocketing rates of middle and working class Americans applying for mortgages for suburban homes and selling their houses in the cities. The administration had harbored some concerns about white citizens' reactions to neighborhood integration and she turned to a section of interviews with some of the movers.\n\nThe fleeing homeowners cited rising neighborhood crime, as well as the failure of urban renewal and unsatisfactory infrastructure. Beneath the complaints, or sometimes overtly, Jacobs detected anger at the new arrivals in the neighborhood, natural scapegoats for the community's troubles.\n\nThe consequences of this so-called 'white flight' would be severe, Jacobs already knew. Cities' tax bases would diminish significantly and suffer economically as swathes of citizens uprooted to distant suburbs, leaving the poor and marginalized to suffer in the debris left behind. More cynically, she also realized the danger this posed to President Hart's agenda. The country had made some progress on civil rights over the years but this issue could be career-ender for all involved if mishandled.\n\nWith this in mind, she immediately began drafting her report for the cabinet and the President. She was in a position to act, and every fiber of her being told her to do so before the harm was irreparable.

Cities will lose enormous chunks of revenue at a time when, due to commitments to the URI and the administration's agenda, their expenditures are at record highs.\" Silence hung in the room as the implications sank in. A nationwide debt crisis.\n\n\"I believe this administration's agenda is at a turning point, we either succeed or fail. Mr. President, either we slim these programs down and dampen down the controversy, or we reinforce them to overcome the doubters and expenses, but this middle road is poison.\" Her case made, Jacobs sat down, hoping you'd reached the Michigander.\n\nHart seemed to be turning everything over in his head, weighing the crisis Jacobs had brought him. After a time, his natural inclination for consultation won out.\n\n\"Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Secretary Jacobs. Continue to monitor the situation while I speak with the relevant experts on the matter and see what they recommend.\" Hart said, as the other cabinet secretaries began to clear out, their minds back on their own portfolios.\n\nJacobs sat alone for the moment. She'd tried her best, and hoped the President would act. The country was sleep-walking into a disaster and she could hardly bear to watch.

What am I telling my kids tonight? Huh?\" One of the men heaved his helmet at the foreman, the headwear bouncing off the body of his truck. The man sped up, clambering into the vehicle and peeling away down the road.\n\nAs the construction workers took stock of their situation, they realized there was no point to remaining at the overpass with their common purpose destroyed. Loading up into their trucks, they scattered to the winds chasing the next opportunity.\n\nBehind them and finally alone, the slowly-rusting hulk of the overpass stood as a warning, to what though was unclear. Whether cars would ever cross it or the promise of its partial construction ever be fulfilled was also unknown, but nothing would be added to it for some time other than rot and rust.

The start of every academic year was thus normally a joyous one, though this one was sadly different.\n\nA memorandum from the principal was waiting for her on her desk when she arrived, a stark point of misery in the otherwise bright and happy room. The public school's budget had been unexpectedly lowered, significantly. There would be no new textbooks or equipment and the new curriculum that was to be implemented had been indefinitely delayed.\n\nMrs. Sherman felt for a moment as if the world had been pulled out from under her.

She had less time, so it would be somewhat ramshackle, and she would still be relying on the older textbooks, flawed curriculum and damaged educational equipment in the coming year.

Division among citizens had deepened such that only 23% of Americans felt capable of having a productive discussion with someone who disagreed with them politically.\n\nReading these numbers and seeing the stark declines in sentiment from years prior, Hart's stomach dropped.

In the past he had pared and shaped budgets but in this instance it would be more of an evisceration, a new experience for Nick.\n\nIt was necessary, after all, given the dire straits the city's budget was in. Necessity drew him to first cut repaving the streets, reasoning the citizens would hardly notice, let alone care. With the budget shortfall the way it was they were fortunate to have roads at all. The same motive of necessity led to an end to all new infrastructure projects as wasteful spending given the circumstances. The city was fine as is. Then he turned his attention to park building as well as modernization projects, wiping them out entirely.\n\nLooking down at the new budget before him, pride swelled forth. He had done it, in spite of the exodus of citizens and corresponding collapse in revenues the city would survive the coming year on a far more responsible budget. To be sure, the roads would be worse, the parks limited and the infrastructure problems persistent, but what mattered was keeping the lights on now.\n\nHis work done, the savior of the city decided to leave early for the day.

He worked in a tool-shop a few miles away in town, one of its better employees. After waiting another fifteen minutes with no bus in sight, he checked the schedule, seeing it had been newly updated. That was how he learned the bus that he relied on had been cancelled.\n\nBudget difficulties was the justification, and Mark had heard of other routes being slimmed down or cancelled altogether, but had never expected his own to be affected. Now, he was in a precarious spot. He had to get to work but walking there was a hazardous proposition.\n\nMark did not like to admit it, but Gary had been on a downhill slide recently, with crime surging. His uncle had even been mugged just a few streets over and walking back in the dark, tired after a long day, sounded like a dangerous proposition.\n\nSo he stood there in the bitterly cold Midwestern morning, weighing his options. The bus had been the only public transportation available to him. He didn't have and could not afford a car but he did not fancy hazarding the shadowy streets of the city in early morning or dusk. The wind picking up sealed his decision.\n\nTurning away from the bus-stop, he resolved to return home, switch on the TV and figure out a plan for what to do. Maybe he'd have a beer or two as well, after all, who didn't need a break from work? He'd call in with some excuse, relax a little, and figure it all out later. He certainly wasn't going to be wandering the streets to and from work, the last thing he needed was a mugging."

His favorite time of the week was watching his heroes in their enormous, impressive trucks keeping the city clean. However, these past few weeks he had been disappointed.\n\nTheir previously clean inner-city block was steadily growing seedier and seedier. Bag after bag packed with reeking garbage steadily stunk up the streets. Tyler's heroes were nowhere to be seen, their rates reduced due to the increasingly common refrain of 'budgetary issues'.\n\nTyler's parents had noticed other things. Street paving was being left unfinished, lampposts failed but were not replaced and graffiti and vandalism multiplied. Strangers, unfriendly and gaunt, lurked in alleyways, and there had been reports of attacks and robberies.\n\nTyler noticed his parents increasingly talking late at the dinner table, eventually hearing the dread words: 'move away'. He loved his school, but many of his friends had also moved recently. Maybe elsewhere, somewhere with garbage men would be better? Gunshots in the night awoke the entire family that night, a confused and scared Tyler having to sleep with his parents for a week. The move was now a necessity.\n\nWith a heavy heart, the Browns departed their home. They had watched the neighborhood decay in front of them and so, like many others before them, they left for brighter pastures in a suburb twenty miles away. Tyler, still unsure of the change, was told the garbage men came weekly at the new home. Mollified, he grew excited to see the new house and the pain of the change faded. Life went on."

Robberies were most common, elderly citizens having purses grabbed or being beaten for their wallets. Murders had also shot up. In the past, it had been the rare jealous husband caught by the police quickly, now strangers shot one another over a baggie of reefer, or burglaries would escalate into dead homeowners.\n\nHe could see the desperation in everyone's eyes when he was on the streets. Citizens were scared, criminals could see an opportunity and the government was nowhere in sight. The Hart administration had talked a big game, but the results had scared the cities enough they wanted nothing to do with anything the Feds were pitching.\n\nAt least it kept Frank Rizzi busy, he thought to himself as another call came in. Double homicide of two young males, possible drug connection. An increasingly common narrative, but Frank enjoyed the classics and wanted to be back on the hunt.

To avoid a debt crisis, those cities then cut their expenditures. These cuts included city services that residents relied upon and had come to expect, such as law enforcement or sanitation services. The decay of services naturally led to further departures, requiring another round of budget adjustments.\n\nWith no options left to them, city governments across the land began canceling any ongoing projects, clawing back every cent of expenditure possible to shore up the gaping holes in their bottom lines. This not only further harmed the cities' economies but signified something greater, a complete retreat by American cities from any sort of urban reform.\n\nRather than invest in expensive public transportation or attempt any serious reform by public projects, the cities would focus on the two traditional points of urban management. The cities would build roads and maintain law and order, with any of the high-minded nonsense from the Hart administration left by the wayside. After their disappointment with reform, the cities no longer had any thirst for progress.\n\nAmid all of this, the poorest urban neighborhoods of all suffered in obscurity. The nightly news rarely spoke of Harlem, the Black Belt, or Fuller Park. The families trapped in urban decay, brutalized by crime and abandoned by the cities they called home went unmentioned. An attempt had been made to help them, bold but brief, and it had failed miserably. Maybe they had never had a chance, or perhaps the brief chance that had existed had been bungled and lost for a generation."

The all-white city council had said no, then said it again, and again. He marched in the streets against police brutality and had police dogs sicced on him by laughing officers. He had just about had enough. Then word spread through the Black neighborhoods that a young Black man had been doused in gasoline and set alight by a white gang.\n\nSo, Oliver, his neighbors, friends and strangers found themselves on the streets, screaming, shouting, demanding to be seen. Any thought of marches, of petitions, of reform had disappeared entirely. Fires licked the edges of stores, their display windows shattered and contents seized. A line of riot officers, carrying shields and toting canisters of tear gas, blocked their egress from the street and broader neighborhood. Their rage would be tolerated, but only so long as the fires of discontent torched Black rather than white neighborhoods.\n\nTo further reinforce that point, white rioters were out on the streets tonight as well, with the police either cooperating with them or rarely and halfheartedly trying to send them home. White gangs, sensing an opportunity, also took to the streets and rooftops, taking potshots at Blacks they saw on the street. Many had been waiting for this day to come for months if not years, savoring the open conflict.\n\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania, eager to be seen standing against disorder was quick with a statement: \"I am appalled at the rioting taking place in York.

Discontented citizens, refusing both the ballot and bullhorn, instead turn to looting, arson and brawling as a means of recourse. Such violence is all the more reprehensible when these same citizens have alternative means of being heard by the government and effecting desired policy changes than mob violence.\n\nThese scenes are sadly familiar to many citizens, who can recall similar scenes from the unrest in Birmingham amid Dr. King's protests only a few years ago. The avowed claim of the civil rights campaigner to be 'non-violent' appears increasingly at odds with the results of his movement. How many more Yorks will there be in the pursuit of utopian equality? How many more poor neighborhoods will suffer the rage of their inhabitants?\n\n\"At the root of this, it is obvious, is the race issue. A compromise, bringing together all Americans, is worth seeking even if radicals on both sides must be ignored. President Hart's plans for integration, of non-discrimination, strike at the heart of American society, of freedom of association, and historic neighborhood character rendering them fundamentally unworkable. Nor can the utmost desires of Dixie be entertained.\"\n\nWhile such a settlement is pursued, the state cannot abdicate its duty. The maintenance of public order and the prevention of mob violence is the premise of all civil government. If local police are unable to prevent these outrages, the national guard and FBI should be ready to step into the breach and guarantee domestic tranquility."

As they withdrew, stores were looted, firebombed, and occasionally, if Black-owned or operated by a decent white, left untouched.\n\nWhen night fell, the police took their revenge. Shotgun blasts garnering a half dozen dead were sufficient to dissuade the vast majority to abandon their insurrection. Naturally, things got worse as Governor Lester Maddox decided to issue a statement.\n\n\"Despite the chaos I am proud of the police response.

This is a term used for three purposes, all of which work directly against the cause of racial liberation. First, its use of the word 'race' invokes the racial unity of the white majority to resist any claims to freedom by minorities, specifically Black people. This assures white unity in the maintenance of white supremacy.\n\nThe next purpose behind this term is to slander legitimate grievances and resistance activity to oppression as criminal activity. For Black Americans, white police are a brutish and oppressive class. They have taken too many of our children and parents away, either to the prison farm or the morgue. They guard the border between Black people and White America. Standing between an oppressed people and a better life, the cop swinging the truncheon is a monster.\n\nFinally, the purpose of this term is to avoid the use of the proper word: REBELLION. A country founded on a revolution has spawned another one, within itself. This true revolution rejects its progenitor's evil hypocrisy. The words of the declaration of Independence, 'all men are created equal' remain as true as the day it was written, yet America has failed to live up to that promise every minute of its existence.\n\nBlack people have gone from chattel being whipped to death in the fields to 'free' people murdered by police. We are denied equal housing, decent jobs and quality education. Every President has failed to do their job and guarantee our people justice. Finally, we have had enough. Until every White American understands that there can be no peace until there is justice, this will continue.

Each group stayed in their own neighborhoods—segregated portions making up a divided yet powerful whole. The Urban Renewal Initiative however, had begun to change that.\n\nWith the increased funds and enforcement from the federal government, the longstanding de facto segregation was at last being challenged. The invisible walls between neighborhoods were gradually being broken down as Black residents ventured into and resided within previously entirely white enclaves. Apartments and homes became available to them, even if only due to threats of government litigation under new federal anti-discrimination measures.\n\nFor many, this was a time of promise. People could climb out of the slums and into homes suitable for human inhabitation with the promise of better schools, better services and better jobs. For others, unwilling to tolerate a neighbor of a different race, this seemed like the first wave of an invasion.\n\nThe brief euphoria for non-whites and anxiety among whites soon gave way to an unrelenting tension. The new non-white arrivals were made to feel like outsiders, to understand that they were not welcome and that if the whites had anything to say about it their intrusion would be temporary. Rude comments, conflicts and other incidents had every resident of Chicago doubting the intentions of anyone with a different shade of skin. The walls had been demolished, but great divides had appeared in the void left by them and in spite of the ever-present federal regulations and dollars they seemed to be only deepening."

On the right, many blue-collar whites were turning against their traditional party, the Democrats, viewing the attempted integration as an attack on themselves. The Marxists, meanwhile, capitalized on the disillusionment of civil rights organizers who no longer saw a productive path through the political mainstream.\n\nStanding from his desk, he looked out of the window, onto a nation very different from when he had entered office. He had been inaugurated promising progress and justice, yet today it seemed there was only new division and ashes choking the cities."

Hart nodded and rose, happy to meet the winning team from the National Academic Decathlon competition.\n\nA group of bright-looking high schoolers soon trooped into the Oval Office, most affecting nonchalance but still covertly wondering at their surroundings. One girl broke from the pack however and immediately began peppering President Hart with questions.\n\n\"Mr. President, will the URI include free clinics in certain urban areas? Have you considered congestion charges entering cities as a means of funding low-cost or even free public transportation?\" Hart was, very briefly, struck dumb, exchanging an amused look with Morrison at his side.\n\n\"Clinics will play a role in the URI,\" He said, smiling at her obvious interest, \"But I hadn't considered the congestion charge matter, I think it was discussed early on but I'm not sure-\" He barely got the words out before the rapid-fire questions continued.\n\n\"How will funding responsibilities be split? Which lamp-post design will the federal government encourage or will it depend on the area?\" The questions continued, Hart struggling to respond but taking great joy in her obvious interest and how she had clearly been following the program's development in the news.\n\n\"Smart kid,\" Chep said after the event was over, \"I wish they all came out like her.\""

 hart.japanacdec.1.desc: "Washington, D.C. was no stranger to odd new arrivals, but the convoy of school buses pulling into the nation's capital did manage to draw some attention. Spilling out of the buses, legions of eager students arrived in the city to compete in the national Academic Decathlon. The Decathlon was a yearly event consisting of questions involving art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science with further sections for speech, debate and interviews.\n\nThe arriving students were the flower of the American education system, its next generation of lawyers, scientists and doctors. For some in Washington, their arrival proposed an enticing opportunity. Vice President Chep Morrison and Secretary of State Harry Truman approached President Hart with an intriguing proposal.\n\n\"We should consider inviting a Japanese team. It's a nice gesture, and if they accept we'll get a chance to see how our youngster measure up against the real competition.\"\n\n\"Think of it as the Olympics on a much smaller scale,\" Truman offered, trying to assuage any skepticism Hart may be feeling, \"The exchange of 'athletes' and friendly competition creates goodwill and trust between nations, in theory. This is the next step in a thaw, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well then, gentlemen, let's proceed with your plan,\" Hart said, \"Get a diplomatic note to the Japanese Prime Minister proposing such an exchange. If they go for it, we're golden, and if they refuse,\" And here a small smile played across Philip Hart's face, \"Then we know they're afraid of a little friendly competition.\""

The United States wished for the Empire of Japan to dispatch a delegation of talented students to compete in something called an 'academic decathlon'. Once the concept was explained, the debate among the cabinet ministers began.\n\n\"This would be an excellent opportunity for our students to gain perspective on American education and schooling, as well as the students themselves.\" The foreign minister offered, having come to rather like the idea of a thaw as it meant more responsibilities for him and his office.\n\n\"I am not so sure, dear colleague,\" The Education minister interjected, keenly aware that an academic defeat overseas would not reflect well on him or his ministry, \"Not only would we be exposing our youth to American decadence but they may also be treated very poorly and perhaps even humiliated by their hosts. America is known for its racism, after all.\" Many of the cabinet members nodded in agreement, well-aware of Americans' thoughts on 'the Oriental races' and unwilling to see Japan's star youths insulted by the rude Yankees.\n\nThe debate continued in circles for some time, the pros of the plan matching up against the cons nearly perfectly. With consensus impossible to reach, the decision was made that the Prime Minister would have the final say, breaking the ministerial deadlock. Either Japan's star students would be headed to D.C., or America's invitation and the thaw it seemed to imply, would be rejected."

They had half-expected this outcome and now at least the winner of the competition was guaranteed to be an American.\n\nFor Tate Andrews, a competitor in the Academic Decathlon, the Japanese refusal was actually rather disappointing. The rumor that Japanese students might be competing had spread like wildfire among the American students, with fears of 'robotic' Japanese students dominating the competition persisting.\n\nStill, a current of disappointment ran through Tate and some of the others as the competition kicked off. He had wanted to test his skills and knowledge against the best, at first in the country, then in the world, or at least the Pacific. It would have been so interesting to compete with the Japanese, to learn what they thought about the United States, and see whether they were actually as good as the rumors seemed to make out.\n\n\"Mr Andrews, your question. Explain Niels Bohr's contributions to physics, specifically his work on the atom.\" The cold voice of the Academic Decathlon judge startled Tate from hisworld of what-ifs and back into the rough and tumble world of Academic Decathlon. He scrambled, his mind racing.\n\n\"Niels Bohr...ah...\" He was glad the Japanese weren't here to see this, though his parents had made the trip and were watching axiously, \"Niels Bohr developed the atom model, particularly the concept of discrete electrons.\""

He shook hands with the victors, then the runners up as the cameras flashed.\n\nAfter the trophies had been given, cake and other snacks were served. The Americans had occupied most of the tables while the Japanese students kept to themselves, basking in their victory. Occasionally, loud cheers of 'banzai!' erupted, prompting reproachful looks from their hosts.The Decathlon ended, the Japanese students had no reason to remain in the United States. Glory awaited them at home in Tokyo where the press was already writing up the Japanese academic triumph. Many of the students were excited for what this success meant for their university prospects.\n\nThe Americans, beaten at their own game at home, took solace in the narrowness of the Japanese victory.

Championed by the Hart administration, the bill would expand and subsidize rehabilitation programs for drug addicts in America's cities.\n\nThe bill's introduction does not guarantee its passage. There remain conservative skeptics within the coalition while the National Progressive Pact assail the legislation from the right and left. The right-wing members of the Pact accuse the bill of coddling criminals, while the some on the Pact's left condemn it as milquetoast reform.\n\nThe bill now faces committees, budgetary hearings, and the politicking of Washington. The Hart administration may still have to work to push it across the line but the bill's importance merits the effort required."

This was an enormous moment for the most needy among urban communities: addicts. They would now have places and procedures to recover and get back on their feet, making kicking their crippling addictions and rejoining society an actual possibility.

Some wanted a second run at the legislation, either whipping votes harder or shifting provisions to win support, but many others, once burned, are much less willing to risk their careers for the benefit of drug addicts.\n\nThis failure is a disappointment for the Hart administration and addicts throughout the country. The lack of programs and assistance will enable addicts to fall further into their addiction while the Hart Administration has seen its ambitious and progressive agenda foiled. Despite the defeat, Hart and his allies would press on."

 hart.senate.13.desc: "A new bill has been introduced to the United States senate. The Urban Housing Opportunity Act targets housing discrimination in America's cities, forbidding racial discrimination in housing sales and rentals. This legislation came in part in response to long-standing concerns of racial discrimination in housing markets that remained strong even as de jure desegregation waned nationwide.\n\nThis bill is a particular priority of HEW Secretary Jane Jacobs, not only as the issue fits within her purview of housing, but also due to support by an unnamed pen pal. President Hart, trusting Jacobs' instincts, has made the bill a priority for his administration. Now, the bill is left to the whims of the Senate."

Gone, it seemed, were the days of open discrimination by landlords and realtors, hopefully harbingering further progress for these communities. Instead of being packed into majority-minority communities with the worst housing by discrimination, non-whites seeking housing would have a fuller market to search through for their preferred dwelling.\n\nThe legislation forbids discrimination in housing sales and rentals, making it a crucial tool for non-whites to build lasting wealth and secure proper housing for them and their families. Now, if a Black citizen can afford a house then they can buy it—no strings attached and with no racist standing in the way."

The Hart Administration's ambitious anti-discrimination plan for urban housing has failed, defeated by a Senate more concerned with the voices of reactionaries than the necessity of fairness and justice. The bill had drawn criticism from rightwing groups as the next step in 'the integration and degradation of America'.\n\nNow with the bill's defeat, progress seems to have stalled on this front at least.

Among other things, the USDOC Modernization Act will allow the Department of Commerce to work with states on establishing and keeping the highway program running on time.\n\nThe bill has the support of President Hart, who has described as a giant leap forward for both America and his transportation reform agenda.

With President Hart's wide-ranging reform plans touching every part of American life, particularly transport and commerce, a modern and efficient Department of Commerce is critical.

The bill establishes federal standards on gun possession, forbidding the sale and possession of arms to felons, drug addicts and the mentally incompetent. The Act also requires that any individual or business involved in the sale of firearms must register with the federal government with further limitations placed on interstate transfers of weapons.\n\nThe bill has been controversial, with gun rights advocates calling it a tyrannical power grab. For President Hart, however, it is simply a necessary step in tackling urban crime, exacerbated by the unregulated sale of weapons, often across state lines. If the American city is to prosper, it must first be peaceful."

With the bill on its way to President Hart's desk, it seems that the fortunes of American cities seem set to soar. Prohibiting sales to and possession of weapons to criminals and addicts, limiting interstate transfers and regulating firearms sellers would all be key steps in the government's struggle with urban crime.\n\nWith many Americans alarmed at rising crime, the new legislation comes as welcome news. Thanks to President Hart's efforts, criminals will be unable to get their hands on dangerous weapons and presumably rates of gun crime will begin to drop as the law's effects are felt.

Though it may have struck a blow against crime, such a question is now left to historians as the legislation has been abandoned, at least temporarily.\n\nThis is naturally a disappointment to President Hart, coming as a blow to his program of urban renewal.

The Cooperative Act, a resolution declaring the American government's support of workers over employers, sans certain extreme circumstances. This is a big move, solidifying the strong connection recently forged between the federal government and the labor unions.\n\nThe resolution is supported mostly by the Democratic side of the Coalition, with accompanying support from the Progressives in the Pact. Even with this bipartisan favor, the Cooperative Act faces serious hurdles. Conservative Republicans and activists are frothing at the mouth, eager to denounce the resolution and its supporters as borderline socialists, with the encouragement of numerous powerful business executives from the sidelines. No matter, the administration remains confident in the resolution's ability to pass, but its fate lies in the hands of Congress."

The result was, unfortunately for the administration, a rejection for the bill in its entirety. Veterans are shocked, and enraged. They feel they put their body on the line for America, and America gives them nothing in return. Unfortunately for them, no change seems to be on the horizon.\n\nActivists merely point at this chain of events to showcase how deadlocked Congress has become. By failing to pass such a slam dunk bill, how could they be trusted with the security and well-being of the whole nation?

Hungry students are poor learners and keeping bellies full might also help with behavioral problems that can plague schools.\n\nPassing the law is also of course the right thing to do. No moral society should allow children to go hungry. Championed by the left, supported by the center, and grudging tolerated on the right, with opposition muted to fiscal hawks on the fringes, the bill seems sure to achieve a majority."

Jane Jacobs is naturally thrilled, eager to share the victory with her friend, the Pen Pal.\n\nThe positives resulting from the bill should be well apparent. Children know that by going to school they can get a full belly, for far too many an all too rare thing. Parents now have incentives to have their children attend school and well-fed children will be better behaved and more attentive. And above all, America is living up to its promise, of justice for all."

President Hart sternly criticized the Senate's decision as \"a devastatingly foolish choice\", warning them that they bore responsibility for hundreds of thousands of children going hungry. The failure of the legislation has harmed the morale of the Hart administration, with many deeply questioning what was wrong with their government.\n\nThe bill had foundered on the racism of the far-right, who saw too many black faces among the crowd of hungry children for their liking, as well as the ideology of the fiscal hawks, unable to see the dollar lost for penny earned in starving America's next generation.

The Hart administration, with its supporters in Congress, have vowed to change this.\n\nLeading the charge for the bill is Jane Jacobs, the HEW Secretary and a former teacher. Naturally, she has a vested interest in the quality of America's schools. The law will present a basic, standardized curriculum to guarantee every American receives a quality education, guaranteeing state and local compliance with federal funds."

In order to guarantee local participation and compliance, the America Invests Act moves many of the program's costs to the federal government, keeping the balance books of cities relatively unaffected.\n\nThe bill comes after considerable debate within the Hart Administration. Vice President Chep Morrison succeeded in convincing President Hart to support it on the grounds that the federal government should not be sticking cities with an enormous bill from a federally-initiated program. The America Invests Act thus carries a hefty price tag and must survive the Senate before it can actually help anyone."

Many American city-goers are alarmed at the news, aware that their cities face major expenses and the lack of guardrails for debt relief persist.\n\nPresident Hart was naturally distraught at the bill's failure, however he must carry on with his work.

The lion's share of urban renewal efforts shall be directed at America's blighted megapoli - New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Saint Louis. These were once the beating heart of American civilization, and under Hart's watch, they shall become so again.\n\nNaturally, the Act has quickly become enemy #1 for the President's opponents. Millions of voters in white suburbia view his efforts with suspicion, and many Senators in the NPP's Nationalist Caucus have stoked these fears for their own political gain. The President has martialled as much of his political capital in the Senate as he is able to, reaching out to both the RDC and progressive members of the NPP in order to get the Bill through the door.

Urban renewal is coming, whether the President's opponents like it or not.\n\nAnd dislike it they shall, for the Bill's passage has already provoked an uproar among the self-appointed representatives of \"Middle America.\" The NPP's demagogues have now pledged to assemble a coalition of \"concerned citizens\" against President Hart.

Senator Barry Goldwater has been particularly harsh in his critiques of it, labeling the plan as an importation of \"Soviet-style socialism\" into America's cities. Even Governor George Romney has been reluctant to support the bill, fearing the encroachment of potentially corrupt and out-of-touch municipal governments into the public sphere.\n\nHart will have to fall back on his allies in the Democratic Party and the scattered NPP Progressive Caucus while he tries to flip enough seats across the aisle to get the bill through.

Despite all its best efforts, the Municipality Housing Act has not won enough votes to pass the Senate. Secretary Jacobs' ambitious plan may have been a step too far after all. Today, the budget hawks may celebrate a hard-won victory over the upstart from Manhattan, and the legions of NIMBYs can rest easy knowing that their property shall remain undisturbed.\n\nWho then, will speak for the millions of Americans abandoned on the street, or trapped in shoddy tenements? Perhaps they will have to wait for another to champion their cause, for Secretary Jacobs has been tested, and has been found unworthy. President Hart, of course, will have to proceed with his agenda despite this failure. Surely there must be some other policy Congress is more willing to accept?"

 hart.senate.49.t: "Introduction of Rebuild the Ghettos Act"
 hart.senate.49.desc: "The drafting of the Rebuild the Ghettos Act was a tough compromise. Originally desiring a much more ambitious expansion of the URI, President Hart was forced to pare down his ambitions in order to produce something that was more likely to get through the Senate. Produced with the advice of Governor George Romney of the Republicans, the Act would fund the construction of thousands of new public housing projects under the auspices of the Federal Housing Administration - to be turned over to public land trusts upon completion. This approach leaves much to be desired, both in how it excludes municipal governments from the decisionmaking process and makes no provision for maintenence and future construction.\n\nDespite this, the Act still represents a game-changer for the millions of Americans unable to afford a roof over their heads. Both the President and Governor Romney are confident it will significantly contribute to the URI's ambitious poverty reduction targets, and a surprising number of Republicans have been on board with the proposal. Of course, the bill has still earned the ire of hardcore fiscal conservatives and the vulgar populists of the NPP's Nationalist Caucus, who claim that the bill is an undue imposition on the \"average American homeowner.\" Despite this, President Hart does not think it likely that the bill will fail to pass."

 hart.senate.50.desc: "The votes have been counted, and the Rebuild the Ghettos Act has sailed through the Senate on its way to President Hart's desk. No more shall America's cities be blighted by rundown tenements, for the National Housing Administration shall replace them with brand-new public housing units. This plan has won support among a wide swath of the Democrats' urban constituency, as it offers much-needed relief to their lives and pocketbooks. Of course, some NIMBYs are still making noises about \"government overreach\" and \"property values,\" but those complaints will inevitably be sent into the dustbin of history.\n\nOf course, there are those who worry this act does not go far enough. Jane Jacobs fears the NHA will end up repeating the same mistakes the modernists did when they tore through the fabric of urban communities with their ill-conceived projects. Plus, there is the fact that the long-term future of these housing initiatives is uncertain, as after their completion they will be converted to public land trusts and municipal governments will shoulder the burden of maintaining them, but without any financial support to do so. Perhaps, decades in the future, these once-new projects shall also decay and require replacement."

 hart.senate.51.desc: "The votes have been counted, and to the great shock of the Hart Administration, the Rebuild the Ghettos Act has been defeated in the Senate. Somehow, Hart's opponents have managed to halt even the moderate Romney-sponsored compromise plan in its tracks. Commentators across America are reeling from this startling political upset, as the failure of the Act shows how little support remains for President Hart's agenda. Already, NIMBYs and right-wing populists across America are cheering as their great political enemy has been dealt a crippling blow. Despite the disheartening implications of this failure, President Hart will have to find a way to pick himself back up and keep going, no matter how remote the odds of success are."

Drafted by Senator Ted Kennedy in close coordination with the Hart Administration and Labor Unions, the bill aims to provide healthcare coverage to all Americans through a single-payer system.\n\nThe NHIA has already received widespread criticism from many organizations, including the American Medical Association. Conservatives in Congress have already denounced the legislation as merely another attempt at socialized medicine.\n\nThe fight for universal healthcare coverage has flummoxed Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Wheeler. It remains to be seen whether Senator Kennedy and President Hart can succeed where their predecessors have faltered."

The bill primarily focuses on reducing pollution, a growing concern in America, with strict penalties for corporate dumping of pollution in America's green areas and lakes. This will not only keep America green and protect nature, but also prevent any health issues arising from polluting drinking water.\n\nPresident Hart is a champion of the bill, his support galvanized by the advice of Walter Reuther. The United Automobile Workers chief, though a titan of industry in his own right, is not so enamored with smokestacks as to place no value on nature, indeed quite the contrary. Both President and union-leader agree that protecting America's wildlife and improving conditions for the public are worth goals indeed."

Placing harsh sanctions on the members of the Einheitspakt, the Embargo Act will aim to further isolate Germany from American markets, closing loopholes to Pakt nations and harshly penalizing any American business attempting to subvert them.\n\nThe Act has received broad support; its co-sponsors on the hill run the gamut from Barry Goldwater to Scoop Jackson and is widely expected to pass with little opposition when Congress convenes."

He had only one chance to make his point, and knew his skin color would disadvantage him with at least a few of those present.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Chairman,\" Rustin replied, overcoming any remaining nerves and launching into his speech, \"I have come to speak today about the negative effects of the bill being proposed. I understand my fellow citizens' anxiety regarding crime and violence but feel drawn to oppose this law. As written, the legislation is overbroad and will lead to overpolicing of particular neighborhoods with no corresponding decrease in crime.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he watched the committee members' faces, noting contempt or amusement on the more right wing members of the committee member, while polite concern was plastered across the others' visages. He felt a growing pit in his stomach. Not enough of them were listening, or even cared at all.\n\nWatching a televised broadcast of the testimony, Philip Hart was also concerned, though for different reasons. He had not anticipated civil rights activists' opposition to his crime bill. Didn't they know they could trust him not to harm their communities?\n\nDoubt flickered to life within him. He had read the bill and to his eyes nothing had been out of place, no provisions blaringly flawed or miswritten. This was just the usual D.C. hullabaloo, he resolved, and switched off the television, returning to his work. There was nothing to worry about."

A new crime bill had passed, vastly increasing police budgets, and donuts were now a common occurrence at the precinct.\n\n\"All right fellas, listen up,\" Sergeant Roscoe Zebrowski, a grizzled veteran of the force, said as he entered. He reached the front of the room, made sure all were listening and began reading from a clipboard.\n\n\"Starting today, as part of the new city and state statutes in accordance with the Federal Crime Bill, we have new offenses to be on the lookout for. Loitering is arrest-worthy, as are littering, jaywalking, minor vandalism, speeding, drinking in public...\" He read on and on. The cops' smiles, twisting as they munched their treats, had only widened as he went on reading.\n\n\"Unit three, we have store owners on Lexington and King complaining of loitering. They describe a half-dozen black youths, estimated ages sixteen to twenty.\"\n\n\"Copy dispatch. Request backup as we approach.\" The radio squaked an affirmative as Patrolman Cliff Ford swung his cruiser towards the loiterers. A group of young men, standing in a circle talking, looked around in surprise, then horror, to see a police car barreling towards them.\n\n\"Hands in the air!\" Cliff roared as he exited from his car, already nervous at being outnumbered. Scared, mystified, the men, boys in truth, complied. Calling for back-up, Officer Ford summoned a paddy wagon to transport them to lock-up. Finally, the city would get the clean-up it needed, Cliff thought as he responded to another call from dispatch. The work never stopped, but it was worth doing."

I spent six months in prison and have not been able to get a job since.\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything. The cops say I was drinking in public, but it was water. Of course, they waited until my bottle was empty to confront me. When they took me to jail, I thought something was wrong; this used to be the kind of thing you handled with a fine.

This is a natural result of President Hart's misplaced idealism and natural tendency towards being soft on crime. Criminals are emboldened and good citizens are afraid so long as the President is focused more on integration and city-planning than crime control...\"\n\n\"The growth in crime is particularly focused in petty crime, showing clearly that President Hart's efforts have emboldened, rather than petrified, the lowest criminals of America. The President's liberal fixations prevent him from recognizing the criminal as an enemy, instead blindly holding to his view of villain as society's victim...\"\n\n\"Whatever is driving the current rise in crime, Philip Hart is clearly not the man to meet it.

If you want to deal with a criminal, you put him in chains until their debt to society is paid, with a permanent solution for worse characters.

 hart.kennedy.3.desc: "その日の上院は忙しかった。まあ、いつもより忙しいという意味ではあるが。テッド・ケネディ上院議員が新しい健康保険法案を提出して以来、初めて演説をすることになっていた。人前で話すのが初めてという訳ではなかったが、それでもケネディはかなり緊張していた。多くのことがここにかかっていた。数人の上院議員を納得させられるかどうかで、救命医療を自由に受けられるか、防げたはずの死が大量に発生することになるかの分かれ目となるのだ。準備のために、ケネディは旧友にして現米国大統領であるフィリップ・ハートに話を聞いてもらうことにした。\n\n話し始めると、ケネディの不安は消え去り、代わりに自信に包まれていった。ハートは椅子にもたれかかりながら、心の中でメモをとっていた。ケネディが話し終わり、期待に胸を膨らませながら顔を上げると、ハートは身を乗り出して言った。「言葉遣いを柔らかくしよう。穏健派に配慮した表現にするんだ」ケネディは頷きながら、書類に目を落として考えた。\n\n「君ならうまくやり遂げるさ。君なら乗り越えられる。私にはわかってるよ」とフィルが言うと、テッドは視線を向けた。\n\n「全くその通りです。このチャンスを逃すつもりはありません」若き理想主義のショーを堪能したフィルはテッドにペンをひょいと投げると、ケネディは大統領の執務机を使ってすぐさま修正を書きなぐり、部屋を出て行った。"

 hart.kennedy.4.desc: "失敗した法案というのは議事堂では何も珍しいものではない。ほとんどの夢はやがて消えるものであり、テッドもフィルもそのことを承知で臨んでいた。しかし予想とは関係なく、敗北の痛手は存在した。ハートは電話が鳴ったときにこのことを考えており、そして予想通り相手はケネディだった。\n\nどんな言葉よりも先に、まず溜め息があった。「やあ、フィル。そうそう、法案が失敗したんだ。その話は今日、十分にしたんだけどさ」ケネディはちょっと変わった調子で話した。「チェップはどうしたの？彼は私と話したがっていたんだけど、でも私は……私はただ……彼に合わせる顔が無かっただけというか……」テッドは薄い無関心の上っ面を破って自分の思いを語った。「フィル、ごめんなさい。私は、あなたに期待を持たせてしまった。もっとうまくやれたはずだったのに……」ケネディの声が途切れ、ツー、ツーという音だけが残った。ハートは動かなかった。\n\n可哀想なケネディ。フィルはテッドのことを、ワシントンを覆う政治的だとかお世辞だとかといった建前を超えた本当の親友だと考えており、彼は法案の失敗がテッドにどれだけ影響を与えたことを分かっていた。翌日、朝の報告会の後、ハートは直接友人を慰めるために上院の議場へ向かった。そして別の上院のオフィスで、ウイスキーを飲み交わすテッドを見つけ出した。他の上院議員を𠮟りつけて追い払った後、ハートはドアを閉め、ケネディをじっと見つめた。\n\n「これはたった一つの戦いでしかない。ああ、負けたよ。私のせいでもある。もし君がチェップと話していれば、私のことばかり話してたことだろうさ！でも大統領にだって、ケネディにだって、失敗はつきものだ。医療はまさしく君の情熱だろう、何とかしたいとは思わないのかい？」ケネディは頷いた。「それならさっさと腰を上げて仕事に戻ったらどうなんだ！」フィルは心の奥底の攻撃的な感情を何とか呼び起こし、そう叫んだ。ケネディは立ち上がり、電話に手を伸ばした。"

 hart.kennedy.5.desc: "フィルは特別派手にお祝いをする人ではなかった。一杯か二杯飲んで、祝辞を述べ、そのまま帰るという人だった。その傾向は、国民健康保険法が上院を通過した日に崩れることになるだろう。彼はまだそれに署名していなかったが、医療活動家、政策の第一人者、リベラル派のシンクタンク、そしてコロラド州選出の上院議員エドワード・ケネディにとって、それは既定の結果だった。\n\nハートはジェイニーとのささやかな昼食の後、ただ執務机にもたれながら待っていた。フィルが待ち始めてから30秒ほどして、ようやくテッドが電話をかけてきた。「どなたですか？」フィルは開口一番、自分らしくない皮肉を口にした。「ああ、最高の医療保険法案を君のピカピカの机に叩きつけた男だよ！」テッドはほんの少し酔ったような声でそう叫んだ。ハートが答える前に、もう一人の声がした。「その通り！」それは聞きなれたケイジャン訛りのアクセントだった。「チェップもそこに？ああ、パーティーという訳だ！」フィルは冗談を言うと、電話の向こうから笑い声が聞こえてきた。\n\n「ええ、グリーンランドからカリフォルニアに至るまで全ての保守的な利益団体がお漏らししたこの子を、自分の目で見ることができたんだ。みんなよくやった！心からおめでとう、フィル。そして、この子にも！」と、ろれつの回らない声で聞こえてきた。ハートには、チェップがケネディの肩をたたく音が聞こえたような気がした。\n\n「二人とも落ち着くんだ！」「ああ、ああもういい！お前こそ太ったケツしてやがりながら酒も飲まずに！」ケネディが叫び返した。ハートは電話を耳から少し離したが、軽度の難聴を防ぐには少し遅すぎたかもしれなかった。「わかった、わかった。お祝いはするけど、今はしない。話がしたいんだ」とハートが言った。\n\nチェップが離れた後、ケネディとハートは落ち着きながら、二人楽しく過ごした。「私は本当に君を誇りに思っているよ、テッド。君はアメリカのために素晴らしいことをしたんだ」テッドの心からの笑顔が電話口からしみじみと伝わってきた。「ありがとう、フィル。君から多くのことを学べたからこそだよ」フィルはすぐに微笑み返した。"

 hart.rustin.1.t: "Second Opinions"
 hart.rustin.1.desc: "Jane Jacobs had, since being sworn in as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, been required to make a great many phone calls. After so many politicians, businessmen, and \"concerned citizens\", it was good to finally be on the phone with someone she respected as much as Bayard Rustin. \"Mr. Rustin, it's an honor to speak with you,\" she said. \"Your work has been a big inspiration to me and to many others. I'm just calling to let you know that the administration is eager to work with you on any and all urban issues.\"\n\n\"I was glad to hear of your selection, Ms. Jacobs,\" Rustin replied. \"To have someone like you in such a high office gives me hope that we could start seeing some real progress. But while I have a lot of hope for what you could achieve, I also have some concerns I'd like to share with you.\"\n\nJacobs blinked, unsure of what was to come. \"Please. We're always happy to listen.\"\n\n\"Obviously, I stand for workers of all races,\" Rustin said. \"But the fact is that there's a serious legacy of inequality that needs to be addressed with the black working class. If solutions in black neighborhoods aren't tailored for the specifics of their situations, African-Americans could end up left behind. I want to make sure all this urban renewal doesn't just focus on white neighborhoods.\"\n\nJacobs' first instinct was to bite back something about how of course she wouldn't neglect any black neighborhoods. But Rustin had experience with that sort of disappointment- certainly more than she did. \"Thank you for the suggestion, Mr. Rustin. I'll discuss your thoughts with the President, and get back to you.\""
 hart.rustin.1.a: "A new era."
 hart.rustin.2.t: "Forwarding A Suggestion"
 hart.rustin.2.desc: "\"...so that, in a nutshell, is his concern,\" Jacobs said, sitting across from President Hart and the Vice President. \"I really think we should listen to his concerns. If we try to help black neighborhoods in a top-down way, not taking their concerns into account, we don't just risk our policies being ineffective- we could alienate them altogether.\"\n\n\"Alienate them?\" Chep Morrison snorted. \"What're they gonna do- vote for the Nationalists? Look, we're professionals, we know what we're doing. I saved the negroes of New Orleans- what's Bayard Rustin done compared to that? I say we do what we always were gonna do, and fix these cities!\"\n\nJacobs bristled; she was about to offer a harsh retort when the President spoke up. \"Dismissing the concerns of some of our most loyal- and desperate- supporters is not the way to make this country a better place, Chep,\" Hart said. He turned to Jacobs. \"Jane, you've talked to Rustin before, and you have the most experience in this area. I'd like you to meet with him, hear out his ideas in more detail. Let's see what he can bring to the table. This meeting is adjourned.\""
 hart.rustin.2.a: "\"Yes, Mr. President.\""
 hart.rustin.3.t: "Declined"
 hart.rustin.3.desc: "\"The most important thing to keep in mind about public housing is that if there's any room at all for a loophole, someone will use it to keep colored people.\" Jacobs took notes as Bayard Rustin spoke to her over the phone. \"I think that, to be effective, your people need to be proactively monitoring public housing and, where people are being excluded, working against that.\"\n\n\"That's very useful, thank you,\" Jacobs said. \"Something I'd been meaning to ask you- President Hart wants to present a united front against everyone opposed to our agenda. He'd be delighted to meet with you in public, show the whole country that we're working together.\"\n\nA few beats of silence on the other end of the line. Then Rustin spoke again. \"I appreciate the invitation, Ms. Jacobs. But I'm afraid I'll have to decline. I trust that the President wants the best for the negroes. But too much public association between us could bring him some... unwanted attention.\"\n\nJacobs rose her eyebrows. \"I don't follow.\"\n\nRustin sighed. \"All I'll say is that I trust the President to do what's right without me standing by his side. I don't want to take any glory. I just want him to make this country better for us all. And if he doesn't... the american negroes will be there to remind him of his promises.\""

 USA_hart_68_the_hart_presidency_desc: "FDR, Eisenhower, Kefauver, JFK, LBJ. These titans of modern American politics, despite their disparate backgrounds, shared a Dream. Ask any two men what it looks like and you'll get three different answers: for some, it is the prosperity of every American, as was promised in the Declaration of Independence. For others, it is the right to breathe freely knowing that your air is clean and your cities are safe. A much-maligned third, from South to North, saw true liberation despite the odds arrayed against them. Dissimilar yet beautiful and optimism unbridled, their Dream glows like a bright red torch, tendered from keeper to keeper so that it may someday reach its rightwise cauldron.\n\nIn 1968, when the flame seems at its weakest, the Master of the Senate passed his torch to its Conscience. Many may take Philip Hart for a staid, unassuming heir, enforcing the party line and not much else. But civil rights and gun laws are only the least of what the new President has planned. His interpretation of the Dream envisions long, winding roads and rails that extend across the continent from cities built brick-to-mortar with its people in mind. It imagines a nation where crime is an option, rather than a necessity. It yearns for a chance to harness America's awesome potential and direct it towards the betterment of all. The path Hart has built for himself seems harder than it should, but the path of good is always hard, else it was never good to begin with.\n\nHail to the new Chief as we bid farewell to the old. Hail to the bright new day that beckons for the nation's heart and soul. But above all: Hail to the American Dream, ever deferred yet ever in sight."
 USA_hart_68_old_friends_new_dynamic_desc: "America's highest legislature knew Hart for his unwavering, almost headstrong commitment to civil rights and the little man. No plea for moderation deterred him from becoming one of Kennedy's most loyal bannermen during the Birmingham Campaign, and no plea for unity kept him from voicing his dissent at every attempt to wring money out of welfare when the people need them most. The lengths to which Hart defended his principles earned not just the admiration of his like-minded peers but also the begrudging respect of his opponents. States may flip and parties may switch, the saying went, but you can always rely on Hart to do the right thing. He campaigned assuming such a reputation will translate to multi-partisan support for his presidential agenda.\n\nThat... has not necessarily come to pass. His erstwhile peers, it seemed, expect differently of a President than of a Senator. His Republican acquaintances kept their congratulations courteous but coldly brief; the Progressives that once joined him for lunch had scheduled no visits since his November victory. The less said of the Nationalists, the better. Even his own party, once in lockstep behind his plans, now cautioned restraint over \"reckless\" initiatives. The whiplash surprised Hart into several days of quiet reflection.\n\nIt will take the new President time to plan around his title's obsolescence, but he is confident he will soon adjust. He can't despair now when so much hangs on the balance."
 USA_hart_68_cuffed_to_the_chair_desc: "Mark Twain may have said that the man who wants to be President the most is also the last man who deserves it. Therefore, the last man who wants to be President is the man America needs, and so must be dragged kicking and screaming all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue so he can save the country from itself.\n\nAlthough Hart sees a man and not a cure-all in the mirror, \"kicking and screaming\" aptly describes his experience in the campaign trail. Party insiders had egged him for years to toss his hat, and he eventually did so only because he had no choice: the alternative to running was standing aside while conniving men dismantle the causes he championed piecemeal. All he did was say his piece as his allies dragged him from soapbox to soapbox and finally to the Resolute Desk. Dreams took him here but what comes after that? The sheer breadth of answers can paralyze even the most stalwart idealist.\n\nEnter deLesseps Morrison. The man who brought New Orleans to the modern age spent a decade making big plans out of big dreams, and in his Creole wisdom the Vice President suggests hearkening to FDR's first Hundred Days. For now EO's are the way to go, mainly to establish agencies that the administration will rely on down the line."
 USA_hart_68_some_lip_service_desc: "President Hart awoke from the transition period learning some cold, hard truths about his new position. The first went by an old adage: \"The President proposes, Congress disposes.\" The second taught him that political friends don't necessarily make for political allies. The third came right after Election Day, when he learned that there were more chickens and horses than elephants and donkeys in his old stomping ground. Now the President has fewer allies than friends; one miscalculated step, and Congress might be more keen on disposing than governing for the rest of his term.\n\nIt pains him to shelve much of his plans for the time being, but Hart knows better than anyone not to alienate a minority Congress this early on. As such his administration shall uphold bipartisanship -- with Marcantonio's Progressives, with Benson's Nationalists, with anyone who'd give him the time of day -- until the exact moment Congress so much as hints in favor of bolder legislation."
 USA_hart_68_saint_of_the_senate_desc: "The President reserved his Election Night champagne for when he was absolutely certain that he had a shot at fulfilling his ideas wholesale. Then Walter Cronkite announced a Republican-Democrat trifecta at 7:48 PM, and in the hours after that his campaign staff saw the logical result of substituting every gallon of Philip Hart's blood with 24 proof alcohol. After spending days making allies out of his friends within the coalition, President Hart now sits in the Oval Office knowing that both the people and the powers that be stand behind his back. There is no better feeling.\n\nFor a mandate this strong lets Hart begin his term with the transformative reforms he had promised to the voters and to himself. No need to tarnish them with compromise when he can go far just by doubling down. No need to hold back when pushing forwards without abandon is both the necessary and the politically expedient choice. Now he has set his eyes on the nation's homeless; with the Democrats to his left and the Republicans to his right, President Hart will give these listless souls the help they deserve but cannot grasp alone."
 USA_hart_68_coronation_week_desc: "The whirl of the inauguration may be behind the newfound Hart Administration, but that doesn't mean that the people of the nation are behind him too. After all, Hart is one of the most obscure figures to win the Presidency in the last century, and while the voters may have learned who he is as a politician, they certainly haven't seen much of him as a person yet. Only with a united nation behind him will Phil Hart be able to muster the kind of force needed for his agenda to pass smoothly, and the longer he can keep the honeymoon with the American people going, the better. An nation-spanning speaking tour may be just what the train needs to really get rolling out of the station.\n\nSimilarly important, however, will be the one-on-one meetings with influential RDC politicians whose states the tour will happen to pass through. Phil Hart is no bully, but he's no pushover either, and his hope that quiet persuasion will pay dividends will certainly be put to the test as he meets with those who can make or break his agenda. The President may not have friends on Capitol Hill anymore, but they certainly don't have to be his enemies."
 USA_hart_68_the_never_ending_campaign_desc: "President Hart's agenda calls for great change in the structuring of America and her metropolitan hearts. These centers of wealth, society, and power have evolved into snarled tangles of crime and poverty, their residents rushing down sidewalks for fear of muggings and sitting for hours in traffic jams. The American city is a miserable, gray, smoggy place, and that miserable snarl is also the backbone of America's economic base. Reaching in to untangle the web may have temporary consequences, and the President wouldn't want those short-term pains to impact America's long-term future in the shape of bad election seasons.\n\nThat, along with an abundance of general caution - the hand of the free market is a cruel beast - means that some money will be set aside for a rainy day. The party apparatus will not be set aside to rust, but will instead be maintained and prepared to help the popularity of both the President and his allies in the Senate. If times get troubled and the people begin to turn away from the Democratic promise, the party will be there to set them back on the right track - or, at least, to mitigate the damage."
 USA_hart_68_some_pixie_dust_desc: "To start the President's campaign of urban renewal, we have to begin digging at the surface. This early slate of ideas aren't meant to hack at the roots of poverty and crime, nor are they meant to turn the American metropolis into a well-planned haven of efficiency and prosperity. Their purpose, symbolic or surface-level as they may be, is to prove that Phil Hart is serious when he talks about change, prove that his ideas are common-sense and practical, and build some bridges in Congress before he gets into the meat of his ideas. The Clean Streets Act, as it stands, will serve as one of the first in a hopefully long line of legislation to be passed through the halls of Capitol Hill.\n\nThe main purpose of the bill is to, as the name implies, clean the streets of America. Too often are they havens of the homeless, the disadvantaged, the drug dealers and criminals. For Americans to start getting around their cities, they need to feel safe in their cities, and as such the Clean Streets Act will provide funding to city governments for the purpose of clearing the homeless from high-traffic areas and cleaning up the messes they leave behind. Is it a solution? No. Rather, it's a subscription to the old adage \"out of sight, out of mind\", and indeed one could call it cruel. But if the President's agenda is to get to its deeper initiatives while faced with a hostile Congress, it needs to have a few easy wins under its belt, and the American people will know who to thank when they can walk down Main Street without needing to rush and weave past muggers and beggars."
 USA_hart_68_im_no_miracle_worker_desc: "The Soup Kitchen Act is another part of President Hart's common-sense start, slotting into his program of urban renewal like a puzzle piece to the poverty question. Food insecurity is a problem which embeds itself in American cities like cancer, forcing those who don't have ready access to meals into desperate scrounging and spending. A man can't survive without food and water, after all, and a man without food and water is a man who's willing to turn to any length to obtain it.\n\nTo carve your own path to success in life is the American dream, but everyone needs some help now and then. By increasing public access to warm meals, we'll undoubtedly make a dent in the poverty plague, giving the disadvantaged one less problem to worry about. While soup kitchens by themselves will not end homelessness or poverty, they together with other initiatives will surely provide hope and support to those who have slipped through the cracks, not to mention the positive effects which the kitchens have on crime. How can Congress refuse?"
 USA_hart_68_a_well_oiled_machine_desc: "What causes poverty? This is the central question to the Hart Administration, one which can be asked to a thousand different people with a thousand different answers. Some say that it's just the way things are. Others say it's an issue of will and drive. Still others will point to economic strength or weakness, under the assumption that the state of the market determines the state of the people. This vague tidal wave of platitudes and diagnoses, when looked at as a whole, look completely unassailable - but when broken into individual pieces, the problems suddenly become clear and workable.\n\nSuch is the idea behind President Hart's early focus on the problem of drug abuse, a poison which worms its way into the blood and brains of those who are down on their luck, keeping them in the muck which they've stumbled into or even dragging them further down. Though heartless politicians in need of a quick boost often cut their teeth on decrying the druggie, harsh punishments and prison sentences often do little more for these Americans than further tarnish their lives.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Recovery Act proposes a different route. By offering ready access to rehabilitation and recovery, the broken safety net that has failed so often can finally be mended. It's a controversial act, certainly, but with a tentatively supportive Congress waiting for the vote, perhaps some ambition in the early slate of ideas is the way to go"
 USA_hart_68_tough_luck_desc: "Unfortunately, the early slate of President Hart's agenda has met with failure in Congress. Despite the best efforts of the President, his cabinet, and his supporters, the proposals met an uninterested and wary body of legislators less interested in their former colleague's ideas and more concerned with their own calculations and positions. It seems that American cities will continue to go without help for the moment while the newborn administration recalibrates around this unexpected opposition.\n\nIn no way does this spell doom for Hart, but it certainly isn't a pleasant sign. What it means is that we'll have to scale back our ambitions further until we find stable ground. We can propose all the dreams that we have to Congress, but they'll all amount to hot air if we don't build a foundation to work with our colleagues in the Senate first. Instead, the President will turn to common sense, acceptable compromises and little boosts to further our agenda and build a relationship with Capitol Hill. It won't be much, but even a little something is better than nothing at all."
 USA_hart_68_a_fine_gesture_desc: "The fight over civil rights has dragged into another year of controversy, and the road ahead remains long and twisted. Segregation remains popular in large swathes of the South, discrimination is still common nationwide, and African-Americans still feel the oppressive weight of insidious institutional racism on their backs. The American table is tilted against these disadvantaged groups, putting them on a lower standing than their white counterparts and often actively fighting to keep them in their place. Something has to be done - something quieter, something which pokes and removes the subtle gears of discrimination rather than blanketing the problem in legislation from on high.\n\nUnfortunately, with our unreceptive compatriots on Capitol Hill, our early ambitions are limited by their distaste for the President's bold agenda. Our ambitions must be scaled to compensate. HBCUs, the backbone of Black education for over a century, have long struggled to maintain programs which their white counterparts keep with ease thanks to a lack of funding. This can be rectified with the stroke of Hart's pen, and so it will be that a pipeline of money will flow from D.C. to Jackson, to Greensboro, to Prairie View, and to a hundred other institutions.\n\nIt's not much. Indeed, sending extra money to extra places is a lazy solution to the deeply embedded lack of higher education available to black Americans. With the state of Congress, however, there's not much more we can do at the moment. If nothing else, what college wouldn't appreciate a few million dollars from Uncle Sam in their wallet?"
 USA_hart_68_all_natural_desc: "Champagne pops and flows at the White House tonight as news comes through that President Hart's early agenda has been signed, sealed, and delivered by Congress. Despite the skepticism and the fearmongering of wary conservatives, Hart and his cabinet have leaned on enough levers and convinced enough Senators to see their proposals through, finding common ground with those within and without his party to start the creation of a brighter, better American city - and a brighter, better America with it.\n\nWith a foundation of cooperation built, the President can now move onto bigger and better things than his early window dressing. The promise of his ambitious policy slate now seems to be materializing in front of the nation, turning from mere hopes and dreams into real and attainable plans. The road to get there, however, remains perilous and rocky. The conservatives of the nation have no intention of sitting back while Hart enacts his will, and they will resist him with all they have. Even so, Phil Hart has no fear of his enemies - his conscience drives him forwards, and he will see the full breadth of his ideals go through come hell or high water."
 USA_hart_68_a_tighter_grip_desc: "Affirmative Action. The idea is obscure, technical, and prone to misrepresentation. To the average white American, Affirmative Action means the federal government stepping in to tilt the table towards minority groups - African-Americans, especially - and depriving them of a fair shot. To Phil Hart and the civil rights activists, Affirmative Action means the federal government stepping in to equalize the table, tilting it towards minorities in order to counteract the centuries in which the weight of the job market has been distinctly skewed towards white Americans. In essence, affirmative action will create policies and guidelines in order to further encourage the employment of minorities, who have long been passed over for better jobs and left in menial squalor by the hand of the free market.\n\nIt's an ambitious, controversial idea, and conservatives have cried bloody murder about it. Moderates, too, find themselves disturbed by the plan - morally by the thought of potentially making job and education opportunities unfair to white Americans, politically by the thought of an angry mob of voters throwing them into the street come November. The full breadth of Hart's plan may not pass muster in today's America, but at the very least, wider developmental fields like engineering will see their gates opened for a wave of qualified minority workers, ready to fulfill both their dream and the American dream."
 USA_hart_68_hart_and_soul_desc: "We have begun the great work of the Hart Presidency. As the first hundred days have elapsed, we have successfully strengthened our commitment in heart and soul (or, perhaps, \"Hart\" and soul, ha-ha) to the improvement of the American common weal. The President and his staff have made the transition from the simpler, more peaceable politics of the Senate to the cutthroat politics that make life in the White House so difficult.\n\nNow, an opportune time presents itself; now the real work begins. We have set the mood for the Hart Presidency. Hopefully, we will be able to keep our promises to the RDC and more importantly to the people of the United States of America. If all goes well, American transportation will be revolutionized, the cities will become what they were meant to be all along, scientific and educational innovation will attain a new height, and civil rights will be strengthened.\n\nStaffers of the White House! The President has full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in political battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.\n\nGood luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking."
 USA_hart_68_eisenhowers_blessing_desc: "For all of its horror, war oftentimes draws innovation from inspired minds and learned experiences. Consider General Eisenhower, who retired from his duties having been enlightened by the German Autobahn. Its builders are heinous but the fact that it expedited the movement of men, materiel, and commerce across the heart of Europe was undeniable. The vision of an America intertwined and united by such a vast network of asphalt and concrete was first among the equals that had driven the war hero to the White House.\n\nHis hopes and its scope were both dashed by a truant Congress, however, and to this day the Interstate Highway System remains a pale, half-built shadow of its planners' most conservative proposals. With the immensity of our task to expand the Interstate above and beyond what they had envisioned, it is only proper that we beseech well wishes from the greatest brainchild among them.\n\nThe toil ahead, after all, is for his legacy as much as it is for ours."
 USA_hart_68_the_enduring_chug_desc: "It is true that men and women, often immigrants, walking on their bare feet conquered the untamed wildernesses of what is now the west of the United States. But their ardor and the gold they mined were not enough to build permanent prosperity in those lands; it was the construction of great rail lines from coast to coast that made places like California and Utah the powerhouses they are today.\n\nThis is proven by a critical observation that was made as the rail lines developed and were improved: that whereas wealth was created in a given settlement after its settlement, true prosperity was only present once rail connections and infrastructure were established. This was true for San Jose, for Salt Lake City, for Spokane and for Selma - indeed, for virtually all of the great Western towns and cities. Without exception.\n\nA public rail initiative will enable us to build on the foundation the old rail-builders left behind, and just as crucially would strengthen business no matter its location and introduce a truly convenient mode of transport for the average citizen. Even if civilians do not line up to take a ride, commerce will still benefit nonetheless - after all, a train is quicker than a tractor-trailer."
 USA_hart_68_amtrack_is_in_business_desc: "The National Railroad Passenger Corporation - our flagship public rail initiative, referred to as Amtrac, Amtrack, and most accurately Amtrak - is at last in service. It is no better time, too - since the early 1900s, rail has fallen headlong into decline. Passenger service route lines are hard on the drop, the US Post Office Department has diverted its mail delivery from the usual passenger trains to other transport, and train lines are talking about filing for bankruptcy.\n\nThis ends now: Amtrak is in business, and a new era for the passenger train will begin soon. Though we have yet to create defined plans for the Corporation, its goals will be lofty. We will not settle for some stopgap solution that keeps passenger train transport functional through the next decade or half-century. Nor will we completely nationalize the trains the way blundering socialists like Bukharin did.\n\nNo, we will use Amtrak as a sort of actuator arm to stimulate the creation of a real public transit service in this country, to rival and surpass the Yamato and Hitlerite systems of transportation."
 USA_hart_68_the_private_eye_desc: "One of the first areas of the economy that Amtrak will hit will be the private sector. As we have stated beforehand, this is a perfect opportunity for such a measure; railways are shutting down left, right, and center as passenger ridership declines and revenue decays.\n\nBefore we proceed, however, let us be very clear about one thing: we do not now see, nor do we expect to see, a need to build a new railway system from scratch. No, the network that we have right now is already a great beginning; what we need to do is retool, rework, and repair the railway system until it is worthy of Americans and no longer reminiscent of some Arab backwater.\n\nThe incursion of Amtrak into the American private rail sector will be twofold: first, we will buy up abandoned rails with a view on refurbishing them, and second, we will cut leases and contracts to modernize other companies' railways."
 USA_hart_68_the_city_pledge_desc: "Fiddling around with the private railway sector and making our old railways worthy of the modern American citizen is well and good, but it is not a be-all-end-all. Nor will it suffice to prove the merits of Amtrak and its program to the average American businessman and civilian.\n\nSeveral forward-thinking city administrations - leaders of what the Hart Administration has tended to refer to as 'Model Cities' adhering to the 'City Pledge' - have already opted into the Government's urban modernization initiative. Therefore, in addition to and support of all the other proposals being worked on, they will prepare themselves for local rail installations.\n\nThese local rail installations may or may not involve connecting the Model Cities to the broader countrywide rail system. Regardless of whether they do, one thing is certain to be involved in most of the railway plans: city-centered rail systems that cannot but benefit the places where they are built."
 USA_hart_68_the_american_shinkansen_desc: "It is not enough for us to build railways in cities or refurbish old tracks; we must make support for the Amtrak initiatives a matter of patriotism. Fortunately, President Hart is aware of the perfect thing to at once shame American complacency, inspire the American people, and galvanize their business and industry in the direction we desire.\n\nThe Shinkansen - \"New Main Line\" in Japanese, colloquially referred to as the \"Bullet Train\" - is a technological achievement of epochal significance and one that puts the rest of the world to shame. Like the ordnance that gave the Bullet Train its colloquial moniker, these Japanese rapid-transit apparatuses shoot from Tokyo to Osaka in two and a half hours (where driving can take easily six or more).\n\nWe, the American people, are more than capable of equalling and overtaking this technology. Amtrak may not be ahead of the curve now, but once American bullet-train development kicks into high gear and yields results, we and not Japan will be the place to look to for expertise and examples in public transportation!"
 USA_hart_68_take_a_step_back_desc: "Far to the south there lives an extremely ambitious man. His name is Juscelino Kubitschek, and from 1955 to 1960 he was President of Brazil. (President Hart, then merely a freshman senator, met him once when he came north on a diplomatic visit to President Eisenhower.)\n\nPresident Kubitschek - who ran for office again in 1965 - promised during both the times he ran for office that he would bring about 'fifty years of progress in five.' He did pull that off during his first presidency, but there was a horrible hitch: the price for fifty years of progress in one-tenth as many years was fifty years of debt in five.\n\nPresident Hart and his advisors are thinking about this because they need any analogy they can get to help them take a step back and look over the budget. The plans for Amtrak - even if they might do for America what Kubitschek did for Brazil - will need to be reassessed lest we commit a budgetary blunder of Brazilian or even Argentine proportions. Corners must be cut; the President's hard decision will be to decide which ones to cut."
 USA_hart_68_rocky_and_the_rockies_desc: "No matter what one calls the redoubtable Nelson Rockefeller, whether that be \"scion of the Rockefeller oil family\", \"philanthropist\", \"liberal-progressive Republican\", \"Rocky\", or \"certified paintings hoarder\", one thing is clear to everyone that listens to him talk about fiscal matters for even a moment - that he is a staunch fiscal conservative.\n\nThis is why the Hart Administration has begun to set up discussion with him and his faction of the Republican Party. A hefty budget may well make Rocky feel faint, but this 'silly man' as many Democrats call him could be the difference between life and death for our agenda regarding Republican backing.\n\nIt may irritate our Administration to have to consult with Rockefeller and his ilk, who in fact are sometimes pejoratively referred to as the \"Rockies\" for how immovable they can be. But Hart knows we have no choice: Republicans are liable to oppose these plans no matter what, and so we need to do what we can to calm their nerves and keep our coalition as stable as possible no matter what we end up deciding."
 USA_hart_68_talking_down_the_bosses_desc: "In a situation where we need to pinch every penny possible to ensure efficient functioning, and move as hard and fast as we can not to give the GOP and other potentially hostile factions any reason to hit us, corrupt and incompetent contractors are something that we cannot tolerate. Decisive action must be taken to secure ourselves against the prospect.\n\nCareful and thorough audits must be conducted of every company and every contract that has been bid upon. Executives and managers should be closely examined for embezzlement, graft, grift, and any other kind of problematic behavior. Materials used in construction should also be monitored to ensure that they are used for the exact things they were earmarked for and nothing else without very good reason to change the plans.\n\nThere is a likely drawback to all this, unfortunately - if we go about auditing things with our customary zeal, delays are no mere possibility but a certainty. It will be up to the President and the Amtrak leadership to determine the extent to which the cost of delay is outweighed by the cost of malfeasance, corruption, and incompetence not investigated and stopped."
 USA_hart_68_full_steam_ahead_desc: "In these past several months, the Hart Administration has crisscrossed the country, leaving Washington and other havens to take charge of things. To the astonishment of observers, they have not been the usual, hum-drum bureaucrats that one sees mocked in the papers. They have been filled with a bounce and excitement for American infrastructure that is stirring. Their verve and brains is what has made the impossible seem possible.\n\nThis latest initiative—this push for high-speed trains—is possible only because of these people and their desire to make America better. We owe it to them, to the American people, to pass a bill that can bring about real change in transportation, that can help consumers of all types live their lives. With new funding, we can bring people together and show them just what an active federal government can do."
 USA_hart_68_everything_old_shall_now_become_new_desc: "If rails are the veins and arteries of America's transportation system, then what is the heart? President Hart believes that there should not be just one beating heart, but countless: each railway should have a number of cities directly connected to it, in order to act as a catalyst for movement of goods, people, and ideas. To this end, President Hart has encouraged these \"railtowns\" to be expanded- larger cities connected to the central system of the United States will breathe new life -or new blood- into the tracks.\n\nCountless hearts for countless veins will make the bloodflow strong and unyielding; and with it, America will grow stronger."
 USA_hart_68_mr_amtrack_desc: "When people thought of Philip Hart, they used to think of him as the Conscience of the Senate. However, as he pushes to revitalize America's rails, he's gained a new moniker: Mr. Amtrak. Even the Washington Post has taken to printing cartoons with the President in a conductor's hat, pushing America forward.\n\nAnd, all jokes aside, that's just what this Administration will do. We'll go further than any administration before. We'll build track after track to bring towns around the country together. We'll unleash a new wave of prosperity and ingenuity, one built on the bright-eyed ambition of our federal workforce. President Hart will be the Mr. Amtrak that tens of millions know he can be."
 USA_hart_68_the_democracy_mobile_desc: "There's no modern invention that better captures the American belief in personal freedom than the car. With it, a person can go anywhere—whether that's in their hometown or across the country. They own not just a vehicle but the ability to choose.\n\nThis desire for freedom is what drove so many Americans to buy cars for themselves and their families. It's what allowed the automotive industry to reach such an enormous size through the first half of this century. While times have changed, Philip Hart still believes in the promise of companies like Ford and General Motors, of all the innovators of Detroit. He is going to turn back the clock and work with those titans of manufacturing to ensure the automotive industry maintains its peak profits."
 USA_hart_68_the_path_forward_desc: "What does Washington do when it doesn't understand something? It creates a study commission, of course. From Teddy Roosevelt's Commission on Economy and Efficiency to Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women, these task forces are a way to bring experts to the table to study a problem, consult the public on their views, and develop \"evidence-based policies\" that can solve the issue.\n\nNow, we have the opportunity to launch a commission of our own to understand how Americans use cars in their daily life. The findings will be essential in guiding our policies to help drivers and boost the automotive industry. We'll just have to make sure the task force is thorough and unbiased in its work and that we can actually follow through on the solutions it suggests. Otherwise, this could wind up a boondoggle."
 USA_hart_68_the_good_ol_market_desc: "After many conversations with the leading figures of American enterprise and experts at think tanks across DC, the commission has found a solution to the ills plaguing the automotive industry: subsidies. By providing our leading manufacturers with a little extra cash, as they do in Japan and Germany, our companies can lower prices and boost innovation. They can make America competitive internationally.\n\nOf course, this means we're going to be pumping a lot of resources into the Midwest. Those blue-collar workers in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio will be thrilled with all the jobs we're creating for them—but it will take a while for the benefits to trickle out of the region and across the nation."
 USA_hart_68_bits_and_peices_desc: "Ford, GM, and Chrysler are called the \"Big Three\" for a reason. Together, these giants control over 90 percent of all automotive sales in the United States. They invest billions in their plants and use hundreds of thousands to produce their cars. GM alone employs half the total population of Flint, Michigan.\n\nWe need to work with at least one of these companies if we are going to get anywhere with our drive to transform transportation. Under the label of promoting \"public-private partnership,\" the Hart Administration will negotiate a contract with Ford or GM, the bigger of the three, to build train parts and other equipment for the US government. The only question is which of the companies we award the billion-dollar contract."
 USA_hart_68_the_answer_to_everything_desc: "Look, innovation ain't cheap. We knew that when we started. None of the things we want to accomplish with American transportation are possible if we nickel and dime every project, if we cut corners to satisfy the impossible demands of the deficit hawks in Congress and the national media.\n\nSo, yes, Philip Hart is going to be spending more money. Yes, he is going to use his authority as President to authorize a stimulus package for the automotive industry. Yes, it may cause some mild inflation. In the end, though, that money will be worth it. It is important, no, necessary that we spend this money to ensure the success of our projects."

We've flipped through the thing and find the whole thing absurd. Just completely absurd.\n\n...But, there's perhaps a kernel of wisdom behind Mr. Nader's absurd claims. We could do what experts have been asking us to do for a long time by mandating that states implement national driving laws, seatbelt requirements, and car maintenance requirements. We could reduce federal highway dollars to states that refuse to check for people driving under the influence. Some state legislators and libertarians will be mad, certainly, but we'd be saving lives with the strike of a pen with these rules."
 USA_hart_68_these_gas_prices_are_too_damn_high_desc: "\"The pain at the pump.\" It's the common refrain these days. People are spending as much as 38 cents a gallon when they go to fill their tank. It's fueling a great amount of animosity across the country. People are cutting trips short and the satirists on the late night shows are presenting little stories about all the ways people have tried to cut down on costs. (A personal favorite: A woman in Ann Arbor allegedly removed all the doors and seats in her car to improve its mileage.)\n\nGas prices are mostly beyond the control of the President, but there's still little things we can do to reduce some of the pain people are experiencing. In particular, we can sign some new trade deals to increase the national oil supply."
 USA_hart_68_the_americar_desc: "After speaking with people across the country, the commission has produced an... unexpected result. There's no problems with the automotive industry, they claim. The industry is healthier than ever. The problem is with consumers. With companies producing sportier, more expensive cars, it's become harder and harder for new and low-income drivers to buy a car. There's just not many options and, so, the commission has recommended the government step in to provide a budget option.\n\nIt's going to be hard but, we'll be damned, if we aren't going to give this thing a shot. We'll need to schedule some meetings and start talks with industry and regulators. Most importantly, we'll need to decide whether to give Ford or General Motors, the two biggest manufacturers in the country, the contract to produce the damn thing. Both are going to fight like hell to win this deal, regardless of whether it revolutionizes transportation or it becomes a billion-dollar debacle."
 USA_hart_68_a_herculean_task_desc: "Americans have always been sensitive to accusations of government overreach. It's part of the reason why this government-stamped Americar effort is so hard. Let the nuts have their way and the whole thing will be smeared as America's first foray into socialism and a gross misuse of tax dollars. Then they'll force Congress to get involved and whittle the initiative down to nothing.\n\nWe'll need some goddamn good PR to sell this thing. Over the coming weeks, the Hart Administration will start meeting in secret with the big advertising companies of Madison Avenue to see how the government can show the Americar's value. From negotiation to production, we'll need to be proactive in demonstrating just what this car can do."
 USA_hart_68_talk_to_me_jack_desc: "The big wigs of the automotive industry are either too stupid, too cowardly, or too stubborn to listen to us. They've not just kiboshed the Americar effort but set it on fire, rolled it off a cliff, and sent it careening to the bottom of a ravine. People are angry and, just as we worried, the nuts are screaming their heads off about socialism or some goddamn nonsense like that.\n\nIt's time for a back-up plan: If we can't make industry more responsive to the people, we can do what we can to make the people more organized and responsive to industry. It's time to give people the power they need to set prices and market trends."
 USA_hart_68_look_for_the_union_label_desc: "The manufacturers don't want to work with us? That's fine. That's their right. We have plenty of ways of affecting the market, of making cars more affordable to the average consumer. As much as we would have liked to collaborate with industry, there are other groups who we know will be willing to help us. Chief among them are the unions.\n\nIt wouldn't be out of line to take a long, hard look at the relationship between the automotive industry and organized labor. Some of our advisors even believe civil reforms in one sector might inspire change in another. With this in mind, President Hart will reach out to the United Auto Workers to see how the Administration can promote unionization across the Midwest. The union will appreciate it and it might get GM and Ford back in line."
 USA_hart_68_drivers_clubs_desc: "Contrary to press reports, we must once again reiterate that we are not mad. We have absolutely nothing but good will for the corporate giants that pointlessly trashed the last, great opportunity to remake American transportation. In fact, we welcome their valuable role they play in the American economy.\n\nWe also value the role of the consumers in setting market trends and want to ensure they have as much power as possible relative to large corporate institutions. The President will spend the next few weeks encouraging Americans to create drivers' clubs so that they spend less on gas and car maintenance. If adopted on a large enough scale, it could lead to fewer people spending money on cars altogether. That might be just the kick that the manufacturers need to meaningfully respond to the public's needs."

Let's cork some champagne and get some good photos with our industry partners. Let's get some photos of Hart touring plants and shaking hands with blue-collar workers. Let's show the nation who is responsible for this modern American wonder."

Why are half these forms filled with gibberish and the other half duplicative?\n\nSurely, the Hart administration can do something here. Let's recruit some people to study the DMV and look at the methods they use to run the place. Once we understand what the hell is actually happening behind closed doors we can find some ways to improve the way they run and maybe improve how our transportation sector runs overall."
 USA_hart_68_one_last_touch_desc: "The Americar is rolling off the assembly line. We're weeks away from the cars arriving on lots and being sold to consumers. There's just one last detail, one final tweak we need to make to ensure they are actually available to most consumers.\n\nWe need tax breaks. Specifically, we need to offer a tax break to any car dealer that stocks and sells Americars on their lots. These dealers might not like Hart but they'd have to be crazy not to accept the low, low deals that President Hart is offering them to be a part of American history."

They can make new memories with the people they love or carve out their own destiny.\n\nLet's help people understand the real freedom they have now. We'll work with federally funded writers and artists to show America the countless possibilities available to them, whether that's using the Americar's engine to cook, laying out on its spacious back seats, or decorating the ceiling with their kids."

The town's GDP has doubled since the rest stop was completed.\n\nWhich brings the Hart Administration to a new bill in the works, it places government owned rest stops in highway towns. Not only does it bring in government revenue, it helps small towns. A chance to show rural America we haven't forgotten about them. We can save thousands of small towns, and simultaneously court the rural vote too."

The President has two options before him. He can either scrimp and save and make sure rural America is connected, albeit, with cheap, low quality materials such as gravel.\n\nAlternatively, President Hart can spend political capital to guarantee well-maintained asphalt roads make their way to every small town in America. Neither option will make everyone happy, but a decision must be made regardless.\n\nWhat will it be, Mr. President?"

By expanding our natural parks closer to our highways and through improvements in accessibility, it is hoped that our roads can spur increased interest in our great national parks and bring in added revenue for the park service.\n\nOf course, efforts must be taken to preserve the safety of local wildlife, lest the natural excursion of many an American are to be ruined by some unfortunate roadkill."

As construction work concludes on the last of the delayed interstates, the United States is linked from sea to shining sea by the Interstate. From California to the New York Islands, our citizens can now cross a continent, luxuriate in the freedom offered by the automobile, and explore the beauty of this great nation.\n\nSome may criticize the methods of construction and take issue with location and cost, but few can deny the achievement. President Hart has shown America that the administration can deliver, not just in proposal and rhetoric, but in street lights and highways too."

Yet, its imperfections are many, from inequality and inequity amongst workers and wages, the endless struggle between big business and big labor, to small businesses eking out a meager existence amidst cutthroat competition. Imperfections that drive forth the ills that infest the streets of our cities, from declining industry to increased crime and urban decline.\n\nThe solution to these woes is not less government, as some on the right would believe, not to let our cities decline and our industries falter. No, it is the opinion of this administration that what America needs is liberalism that builds. An enduring commitment to righting the ills of society, the imperfections of the economy, and the struggles of those unable to help themselves. We will ensure our cities prosper, our poor are fed, and our economy is free from foreign dependence.\n\nThe road ahead will be long and hard. The costs will be great, the problems many, but we shall not rest before we have built that shining city on a hill."

For too long, white supremacist and fascist elements have been allowed to survive and thrive in America's difficult political climate- but no longer. President Phillip Hart will rebuild the country that we love, ensuring that these groups are fought- at the source. No longer will young men feel that they have no other option- and no longer will these groups be able to become violent."

This is an undeniable truth- objects like this have an unmatched ability to end lives. And there are certain groups that utilize this to great effect. Groups like the Ku Klux Klan and various National Socialist groups, unfortunately, manage to get their hands on an upsetting amount of guns- but no longer. Following some recent tragic events, members of certain groups will be put on lists- lists that will make it much harder to obtain high powered firearms.\n\nAssuming we do it right, of course."
 USA_hart_68_eo_34498_desc: "When Philip Hart was elected not too long ago, he entered office with a promise: He would always act on his principles, no matter how hard or inconvenient. Today, however, he has to confess some selfishness. As crime rose in our cities and gun violence became commonplace, he did not act with the haste he'd promised. He allowed a powerful army of gun lobbyists to prevent him from giving the nation the truth it needs to make decisions.\n\nThe only way to repent for that failing is through good works and deeds, so here is this Administration's. This morning, Philip Hart signed Executive Order #334498. This executive order will, for the first time in our nation's history, establish a national, nonpartisan commission to study the causes and prevention of gun violence in this country. Led by Dr. Milton Eisenhower, a well-respected academic and administrator, commission members will try to understand just what is driving gun violence and what common-sense solutions we need to address them.\n\nThis commission's work will not be popular, especially among gun manufacturers, but it is necessary work."
 USA_hart_68_arm_control_act_of_desc: "The Administration's Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Gun Violence today submitted a progress report to the President. Its findings: Two out of every three homicides are committed with guns. While one fourth of our nation's gun supply is composed of handguns, they make up 75 percent of all gun homicides. What's worse, many of these guns have been sold without proof of need. The lack of restrictions and widespread fear of violence has caused annual handgun sales to quadruple in the last five years.\n\nThis situation is untenable. It requires immediate action from the federal government and from Congress in particular. At the President's request, officials in Congress today introduced the Gun Control Act of [getYear]. Not only will this bill prohibit the interstate transfer of firearms by anyone but manufacturers but it will also institute a new licensing system for all handguns, restricting access to only those who can prove they have a special need and have not been arrested for a previous violent crime. Anyone who fails to attain one of these licenses will have their guns confiscated by the federal government and provided adequate compensation.\n\nLet's not let ourselves be cowed by powerful interests. We need this bill to be tough on crime."
 USA_hart_68_the_first_civil_right_desc: "Now, it's time to have an honest and frank discussion about our nation's young people. Every day, somewhere in this country, a child is scarred by gun violence. It happens in the home, when a young boy or girl plays with the toy they found in their daddy's nightstand. It happens in their neighborhoods when they come across an act of violent crime by a discontented person. It happens when a person in need of psychiatric help finds access to a weapon they should not have.\n\nWe cannot stop all these cases, but research by the commission shows that we can limit when and where children encounter violence. Working with the National League of Cities and US Conference of Mayors, we will support efforts to establish gun-free zones that prohibit any individual from possessing a firearm near schools, libraries, and other sensitive locations. Obviously, these zones will be determined by each city and restrictions will need to be enforced, but the Hart administration can provide the expertise needed to establish these safe spaces around the country."
 USA_hart_68_the_cold_war_desc: "One of the great troubles is that you can't simply wish away 90 million firearms. As much as Congress, and the White House, wishes that habits could change with the stroke of a pen, the truth is that legislation and executive orders can only ever be the start. Real change comes about through enforcement that takes years.\n\nNow, we can begin the journey down that long and difficult road. It's a path that requires cooperation with our friends, the police. It's one that means empowering the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies to crack down on those who might try to circumvent our gun and drug laws. By cleaning up the streets and putting away dangerous criminals, we can reverse decades of urban decay and make America safe again."
 USA_hart_68_its_3am_desc: "Our baptism of fire on the so-called Drug Crisis came during our time on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Working with Senator Birch Bayh, we discovered that not only were millions of illegal drugs and narcotics produced and sold each year but that there were vast international enterprises devoted to maintaining them. Thanks to a culture of moral laxity and a failure to combat these networks, millions have become addicted to drugs such as heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana.\n\nThis issue is one that is close and personal to President Hart and so he will be spending many hours working directly with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to destroy these networks. He will push the commissioner to target every person involved in these enterprises, from the bosses up top all the way down to the drug peddler on the street.\n\nIt won't destroy the illegal drug trade but you can be sure this Administration will do all it can to put a dent in its operations."

Unions aid the party with crucial organizing and fundraising abilities, providing Democratic candidates with a solid base upon which to draw.\n\nThis relationship has been strained over the years, from the Eisenhower administration's careful moderation to the cold shoulder of Nixon. The administration's ambitious program of urban renewal and labor reform, however, demands a much warmer touch. The cooperation of men like Reuther and Meany, and by extension, the UAW and ALF-CIO, is a must if we are to succeed, lest we risk fracturing the entire Democratic party."

With a fresh slate of appointments to the NLRB and a newly empowered mandate to enforce the provisions of the Wagner Act, businesses will think twice before trampling over the rights of labor."

Far too often, the liberalization of international trade has been used to undermine the rights of unions and workers with one-sided agreements. American manufacturers are undercut by a flood of cheap products at home and are unable to compete abroad thanks to tariffs and preferential trade policies.\n\nPresident Hart is no protectionist. Fair trade helps support our allies, reduces the cost of goods, and supports broader economic prosperity at home. Yet, we cannot stand idly by and watch as the prosperity of the working man is undermined through unfair agreements. The Hart Administration will ensure America's trade agreements are fair as well as free."

Now, the single mother can arrive to work on time thanks to public transportation funding, the elderly couple does not need to worry about their power going out due to faulty wiring, and every young child of our country can attend school with a newfound readiness and excitement. Nevertheless, the localities across America need our help to ensure that the money being dispensed towards their cities from coffers of the federal government is being properly delegated towards uses that benefit Americans, rather than allowing any to be lost due to economic attrition, or even worse...that same corruption that attacked our predecessors. Now, the Governors, Mayors, State Legislatures, and City Councils will have an outline as to the do's and the don'ts of this federal relief package."

Thanks to the bright minds and valiant hearts of our Administration, we have managed to put America back onto its forward track, chugging along and picking up every downtrodden American who had been afflicted with infrastructure, financial viability, or livelihood that was simply inadequate for the potential of this country. Now, it is time for us to look at how far we have come, and release a formal audit and investigation into the results of our work thus far. Thereby, we can assure Americans that we shall not falter by instead investigating every success and failure, to see where we can improve, where we can relax, and where we need to move onto in terms of our goals for the year.

However, with a friend and ally in Walter Reuther, and a President willing to get the job done, America's workers and their unions will find a newfound partnership in the government that they so-often butted heads with. Now, having a Reuther brother in the inside of their unionizations and multi-organizational meetings, our administration would be capable of heading to the frontlines for American Workers, and to know what exactly these unions are going to be wanting ahead of the curve. To get there, we need to send our best to the man, making sure that he knows that Philip Hart is a President for the working man just as much as anybody, and that he will be ready to come to the needs of Reuther and all of the unions across the country. After all, working together works!"

After all, some of these socialists and radicals have had a history of riot, revolt, and revenge, and giving these groups what they want would simply be equivalent to stepping on the same landmine we buried. Useless. Destructive. Wanton. Instead, our Administration will play our positive cards and our negative cards right, to make sure that America comes out the best in this grand match of cards. By offering incentives towards the more loyal and moderate unions and curtailing the acceptance of the unfixables, we shall be able to make sure that the right unions join as at the right time, with just the right forms of encouragement needed to give the American worker what they really, truly need."

By encouraging the peoples of this country to pivot back towards the virtues of American products, we encourage more and more people to push our country back onto the railroad forward, against the Nazi, the Fascist, and the Imperialist. No matter the costs, and no matter our losses, nevermore will we, as a country, tolerate the international failures of our past and the bending of the knee towards our enemies abroad. Of course, the same old voices of concern and contrarianism will hawk over our work, saying that the immediate financial pitfalls outweigh our goals in the long run.

However, it's time to remind the American People that not only do we mean every word of what we say, but we have the means to make it happen. What this country can accomplish is untold, and in order to encourage Americans to support Americans in the consumer front above potential international substitutes, we need to properly feed the engines of American Industry the coal that this furnace needs to start firing up. American Labor Standards will swirl into a thunderous maelstrom, ready for the long journey ahead to increase production standards across the country while guaranteeing the safety and security of the American working class across every state and city in this long, wide country.

Electrification is the new way forward for our administration's work, and while our cities and suburbs have been retrofitted with the proper modifications necessary to power American homes and businesses, our rural countryside has been left in the dust by past administrations. While Philip Hart, Chep Morrison, and Jane Jacobs know their way around the proper set up of a city, the time has come for our frontliners on rural infrastructure projects to make their way across our cropfields, valleys, and small-time towns to overcome the threshold of power-lines and generators for this modern age.

Instead, it's time to unleash our monster of industry onto the farmlands of this country, covering the fields, orchards, and grazing pens with high-tech, electrified equipment such as tractors, combine harvesters, and seeders. The slickened lightning that charges our great production efforts across this country will aim their sights down upon the farmer and his farmhands, making sure that American backs will never be broken again to produce the best yields our country can provide."

Sure, the costs of improving American industry are heavy to bear for anyone involved in the process; however, the role of the government is to assume these difficulties so that no one else has to. And yes, the conservative budget hawks will continue on their path of whining and moaning over our operations.

The biggest issue? Businesses, willingly segregating their consumers and disallowing some from partaking within their shops, restaurants, and more. No longer. By offering financial incentives for large and small businesses across this country to racially, sexually, religiously, and nationally desegregate, we encourage a new era of freedom in the free market for all Americans.

However, if we make these leaps and bounds blinded by the glories of our work, so terribly will we crash to the Earth, torn asunder by our own stretching beyond our limits. Instead, we will implement a consistent check upon our work, continuously humbling ourselves in our strides towards a better America for all.

Each and every single person in this cabinet has dedicated themselves to a higher cause, a cause dedicated to the Americans from every single corner of this country, to provide them to a life made better, a home built sturdier, a city feeling safer, and an existence more...comfortable. That's it, that's the word! No more will Americans shudder after the horrors they felt within the wicked triumph of Adolf Hitler, Hirohito, and Mussolini.

Memories often first hold onto playground incidents and childhood friends, interests click into place during long classes and lectures, fuzzy ideas are sharpened and solidified through high school and, for those who pursue it, grown through higher education. Our first friends, first successes and humiliations, and first social milestones all come during this time of learning. A great educational system takes in the young and makes them into bright, empathetic, intelligent men and women who are ready to live a productive, healthy, happy life.\n\nWhy, then, does our system fall so short of these lofty ideals? Why do children forced to digest slavish propaganda to the Emperor in Yokohama or to the Führer in Frankfurt compete with and surpass the knowledge of American students in inner New York City or the plains of Nebraska?\n\nThere are historical reasons, of course, but they all amount to excuses. Reasonable ones, perhaps, but excuses all the same, and what our young ones need are solutions, not platitudes. Those who did not have the chance to obtain a formal education cannot be left to rot while the nation moves on without them. What America desperately needs is a restored, modern education system, informative and all-encompassing, able to both bring in the young and teach the old. Their teachers must be the finest in the world, their meals nourishing and substantial, their materials shiny and new.\n\nThe youth are the future of this country. Let's treat them as such."
 USA_hart_68_competition_and_innovation_desc: "There's a lot which America loves about her schools. America loves football, the Friday night lights on the high school gridiron or the epics which play out between her colleges every Saturday. America loves the prestige of its best, the accomplishment of simply making it into Harvard or Yale. America loves the research and the inventions which emerge from her highest institutions, building a better future for the country and the world.\n\nMost of all, though, America loves itself a good competition. The common thread between school sports, school admissions, and school innovation in America is competition. Michigan and Ohio State go at each other's throats not just because they're close, but because over a century of hatred between them and their states has tendered something far beyond simple grievances. The same story plays out in institutions great and small around the country, extending far beyond campus or even academia, puncturing the fabric of the American spirit. America is not the only nation on Earth with competitions or rivalries, but it may be the only nation where crushing your rivals and being the best is so deeply ingrained into every fiber of its being.\n\nThus, when we go to Congress to plead our case, perhaps a change of angle should be considered. No more pleading for cash, no more bland charts and graphs. We will make it very clear that this is the greatest competition in human history, and what good American can turn down a great competition?\n\nNo more shall Americans simply care about the way in which the wars go or the fortune of their political parties, or how the sports seasons are shaping up. They will gather around the television from Tampa to Tacoma, they will watch the best of our children create grand new things, and they will cheer in the knowledge that Americans, not Nazis or Pan-Asianists, will be the ones who set the course of the future."

Millions have flocked to her golden shores with little more than the idea of starting anew and the hope of better things ahead, from the first Puritans in Massachusetts to the waves of refugees fleeing the dark tide of fascism. Perhaps it is telling that the spirit of the American Dream lives on so strongly in many of these recent arrivals, those who have seen the crushing oppression of Europe, Africa, and Asia firsthand and were fortunate enough to escape it.\n\nThe optimism of the immigrants is not shared by those who grew up in these United States. Our youth are disaffected, unhappy, malaised. They have grown up in a world where America is, for the first time, rank with the bitter taste of failure. The twin defeats on both fronts of the Second World War are ones which Phil Hart knows personally, and the ensuing decades of social fury and discontentment has created a whirlpool of dismay and radicalism. How can we hope for a brighter future if our children have no hope themselves?\n\nThe spirit of Lady Liberty cannot continue to wither away like this. Our sons and daughters must have that flame of hope lit within them once again. They must be reminded of the evil extremists who wreak havoc across the seas, of how their country resolutely soldiers on as the bright light in the darkness.

Those brave boys who went overseas to fight and die in the hills of England and the jungles of the Pacific have, in the chaos and despair of our losing effort, been left behind with only meager support to guide them. The same goes for those men who marched to Africa and Indonesia in the support of fuzzy foreign interests, coming home missing arms or legs or spirit. Still, they are subjected to the same overworked and overstretched system which their fathers were forced to work with, their broken bodies preventing them from career opportunities and their experiences finding no place in civilian life. Eisenhower did his best to treat the men he commanded well, but even his efforts have proven insufficient. Veterans are left in destitution, begging on street corners like the Civil War soldiers of a century ago.\n\nPhilip Hart is a veteran of World War II. He served throughout the defense of England, earning a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He saw the very worst of humanity alongside his compatriots, and he watched them fall in battle under heavy fire. He will not allow the men who remain to waste away, devoid of opportunities or hope.\n\nA premier effort is being made to pass an expanded G.I bill through Congress, one which will expand the support network for veterans and open the gates for those who have served their country to attend America's finest universities. There are some murmurs about the details, but no Senator would dare oppose legislation of this nature outright - and with such soft opposition, its success is practically incontrovertible. Soon, Uncle Sam will extend his lanky hand to the men who have served him well, and he will pay them back for their sacrifice."
 USA_hart_68_lessons_for_life_desc: "When the average citizen thinks of the Army, their mind immediately turns to tanks, guns, bombs, and planes. One can hardly blame them. After all, the purpose of the Army is to defend America's interests through military force. The truth is, however, that the military serves a purpose far beyond simply training its men how to hold a gun. In the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, or otherwise, men enter the service as civilians and emerge as honed, disciplined leaders. President Hart would know - after all, he's a veteran himself, and he has the scars to prove it.\n\nCritically, however, the Army is not simply limited to soldiers. Divisions need all sorts of positions to be filled, and the Engineers are high up on that list. Those crucial elite march in front of and behind their compatriots, building bridges and barricades ahead of the men while erecting bases and roads to aid their operations. Additionally, the Engineers help rebuild decimated civilian infrastructure and buildings where war has left its mark. To be blunt, no war could be fought or won by the United States without the hard work of its logistical elements such as the Engineers.\n\nSo why, then, are so many of our military engineers allowed to simply languish without civilian projects when their tours expire? Why is it that Army Engineers are not fast-tracked into electronic and scientific jobs, able to help continue America's growth while being paid handsomely for it? Indeed, why are so few former soldiers given a path into engineering? Electronics industries have created staggering progress in the computing field, and Hart's agenda calls for vast civilian infrastructure overhauls. It's only smart to put two and two together. If we're going to achieve our lofty goals before the Germans or Japanese complete theirs, it'll be necessary."

His clothes are dirty and ragged at the edges, and he smells faintly of marijuana. Passersby take a wide berth to avoid him, their eyes flicking around to the cars, the streetlight, the others around them - anything to avoid eye contact. Not one of them thinks to toss a coin into his crumpled green hat, nor do they take more than a cursory glance at his cardboard sign, letters scrawled in black marker - \"PLEASE HELP A VETERAN\".\n\nThe only thing more tragic than the plight of this once-proud soldier is the fact that he isn't the only one.\n\nThese soldiers have given their all for this country. They went overseas to fight for her ideals or for the freedoms of others, defending our nation from Nazism and Fascism. They sacrificed their bodies, their minds, and their souls to bear witness to the evils of the Reich and the Empire - and for their sacrifice, too many have been rewarded with nothing more than a cold street corner and the promise that the VA will get to them eventually. For many, it's a day that never comes.\n\nThis vast oversight is a scar that has remained on our country's conscience for far too long, and President Hart has no intention of letting it stay any longer. A bill to expand the VA further is sailing smoothly through Congress, soon to deliver itself on the President's desk, where he will take his victory and show it for all to see. A guaranteed victory it is indeed, for not even the most conservative fiscal hawk is willing to stand against supporting those who have put themselves on the line for our country."
 USA_hart_68_the_sacred_right_desc: "America's foundation was built on many things. Everyone knows the passage about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, just as they know about the American Dream and the grand idea of carving one's own path to success. Yet the central pillar to everything comes in a process that today is so sacred, yet so routine - the vote. The American Experiment is what truly defines America, the oldest continuous modern democracy in the world. Such lofty status is even more impressive in this time of darkness and authoritarianism, and it is a status which all decent citizens can agree must be maintained.\n\nBut for many of our brightest youth, they don't get the chance to participate in democracy for themselves before they fight for it. Too many young men, fresh out of high school, have found themselves drafted into, fighting in, and dying in wars while having no choice in any part of their involvement. Between the age of 18 and 21, it is possible - and at times even likely - that a student can be sent off to war without ever having the chance to dissent. Too young to vote, but old enough to die? President Hart can't in good conscience keep such an unfair situation in place.\n\nA solution does exist in the 24th Amendment, which has been working its way into the halls of state legislatures nationwide. The proposal to lower the voting age to 18 has raised some eyebrows among those who are wary of so-called entitlement, and the amendment has stalled for the time being. If we add our weight to the mix, though, we can win victories both political and moral - political in ensuring a friendly base of young voters, moral in it being the right thing to do. Philip Hart can't refuse that."
 USA_hart_68_american_athletics_desc: "There aren't many things Americans agree on in this day and age. Our political divides reach deep into our public discourse, with dozens of different ideologues preaching their opinions on the right track for this country from all across the spectrum. Who can blame them? Even President Hart has difficulty understanding the pigheadedness of some of his most staunch opponents when it comes to solutions he finds common-sense. How must it feel for someone without the power of the Presidency, the average Joe whose political power is practically null?\n\nThere is at least one subject, though, which brings Americans together. Athletics. When the Olympics come around, citizens from coast to coast put aside their differences to cheer for the Stars and Stripes while her greatest athletes put on spectacular performances. Maybe it's American science which makes them so good. Maybe it's the American spirit. Whatever it is, the love of sports extends far past the Olympics into yearly rituals - baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and many other games hold a firm grip over America's heart from the lowest youth levels to the most lofty professionals. Bob Gibson, Joe Namath, Wilt Chamberlain - these are the American demigods of the modern day, far more beloved than any President could ever be.\n\nIt only makes sense, then, to promote the idea of the American athlete far and wide. These young men who make their country proud should be idolized by a generation of up-and-coming citizens, role models in both physical health and their humble attitude. When America is healthy, America is happy, and who's more convincing - a faceless government agency telling you to eat your veggies, or Willie Mays saying the same thing?"
 USA_hart_68_a_life_well_spent_desc: "To be frank, Americans today are scared of the military. They aren't scared of fighting it, or of its ability to defend them. They're scared of serving, of being shipped off halfway around the world to die in the hills of the Boer Republic or the jungles of Indonesia, of never seeing those they love again, of dying for a hazy cause which never seems to get any closer. Years of constant conflict involving our boys has led to a perception of today's military as little more than a march to the casket - a fatalistic view which has seeped into the ranks, dropping morale among frontline troops to the point of crisis and depressing recruitment to new lows.\n\nThe military is not a death sentence. Phil Hart can attest to that personally. What it truly is, according to him and his administration, is a place where young men can serve their community and their nation. The military is a profession, a job as real and as beneficial as any other. It disciplines and strengthens those who enter it, creates strong men who are ready to face the challenges of the world in far more ways than with a rifle. We must place a magnifying glass on the men who have joined the forces and grown into better men, those who have changed for the better instead of those who have been buried.\n\nOur soldiers are American heroes. The Hart Administration has seen to it that they are treated as such, both when in the military and once they've completed their service. Now, it's time to open the door to the next generation of recruits - the men that will keep America safe for decades to come."
 USA_hart_68_the_best_weapon_desc: "Our American youth are growing up into a world far different than the one even their parents knew. Technology has advanced at a mind-boggling pace, political developments are constant and only getting faster, and a wave of social change has swept through America's foundations. Our nation is under threat by twin fascist empires across both oceans. Few times in the nation's history have been so tumultuous as this, nor so crucial. A literal mind would see this situation and decide that the only way to succeed is through direct force - a stronger army, more nuclear weapons, more interventions. The simplest solutions, however, are not always the right ones.\n\nWhat President Hart believes is that America cannot simply fight to win the present. It must also plan and set up its future for success. To do that, we must invest in the future of our children, creating opportunities and building the foundations of a sturdy and able education. These bright youngsters will eventually take the reins from us, as the hand of time eternally dictates, and the best way to ensure their success is to give them a full deck of cards. Short-sighted opponents of Hart's long-reaching agenda may decry this as pointless speculative spending, but we in the White House know better. In twenty years, when our students begin charting America's course, they will have no choice but to thank us for our proactive work. It's the least we can do."
 USA_hart_68_under_god_desc: "Our kids don't understand what a special thing they have! What else can explain the startling rise of extremist ideology among those disaffected youngsters, who in many cases have abandoned the status quo which they believe has failed them? Decades of failure have led our children to believe that there is simply no hope left for them within the system, driving them out of healthy political exchange and into the siren song of communism or Nazism. Should these anti-American radicals get into the halls of power or, God forbid, the Presidency, who knows what sort of damage they could cause?\n\nSomeday, our children will take ownership of our Union, and we cannot simply allow violent radicals to make those future leaders into hardline saboteurs. They must be taught about how truly special their home is, read and learn the works of the great American writers, listen to the songs of America's best composers and musicians. They will know just how unique the American experiment is in human history and how critical it is that we defend the liberty and opportunity it offers. By the end of their education, students from coast to coast will emerge not as disenchanted brick-hurlers or heiling bigots, but instead as productive and intelligent citizens ready to create the brighter future they envision.\n\nThis is not to say that America is perfect as it stands, nor is it to claim that dissenting from the Government's viewpoint is wrong. President Hart does not seek to build a cult around himself. What he wants is for our schools to establish just how precious America and her liberty is, and in doing so convince those wayward sons and daughters of ours that the way to go is not to burn the system down, but to build a better nation for us all."
 USA_hart_68_no_stomach_left_behind_desc: "If you can believe it, some budget hawks in Congress have raised issues with our plan for free school lunches. They claim that the lost revenue will risk pushing schools into debt, that the federal government should not have final say over what children in local schools eat, or that federally provided lunches would be somehow inferior in quality to those privately sold. When all else fails, they bring up the tried and tested complaint of \"socialism\" to attempt to keep us from passing our agenda.\n\nFor the life of him, President Hart simply cannot understand why any good and decent person would oppose something so good-hearted and moral as giving our children free lunches. Shall our kids instead go hungry? Shall students get worse grades on their exams not out of any personal failings, but because all they can think about is the pit in their stomach? Some things are more important than a budget. Some expenditures are clearly worth their price tag. That this sort of legislation has garnered any sort of fight is a disappointing reminder of how dead-set our opponents are in their resistance to the Hart agenda.\n\nNo matter. Most Senators see our point of view that feeding our kids is the right thing to do. Those who don't can have an exciting time in their home state explaining why they think little Billy should go hungry. Only a great calamity will prevent us from succeeding here."
 USA_hart_68_the_elephant_in_the_room_desc: "To many Americans, the issue of school segregation was settled with Knox County Public Schools v. United States and the Civil Rights Act. With the stroke of a pen, the status quo of segregated education was torn down, and with the stroke of another, the new standard of equality was enforced. Finally, Black students could attend the same schools as their White counterparts, receiving the same quality of education and resources that will lead them into a lifetime of opportunity.\n\nOne frustrating point about segregationists, however, is how persistent they are. Despite the best intentions of those who penned the Civil Rights Act, these bigots have sniffed out and exploited loopholes left in the wording in order to sneakily enforce racial inequality. Through the guise of private schools, those Americans who aim to keep their children separate from other races have enrolled them into institutions which just so happen to have not quite gotten around to integrating their student body.\n\nSuch underhanded racism is blatantly against the law, one would think, but the truth is not so simple. Loopholes are loopholes for a reason. We will have to expect opposition, court battles and protests to stop our far-reaching agenda. It will be painful, costly, and may not fall in our favor. We pursue integration anyways, certainly not because it will be easy, but because it will be right."
 USA_hart_68_the_right_stuff_desc: "America loves its heroes. Why else do our citizens cheer so hard for the athletic greats, the Johnny Unitas' and Bob Beamon's of our nation? Why else would grand monuments to Washington and Lincoln be built, their faces carved into a mountain alongside Roosevelt and Jefferson over fifteen years of hard labor? Why else are men like John Wayne and James Dean so revered on the silver screen? These men and the characters they portray carved their own path, left their mark on the world around them, and became legendary in the American consciousness. Nothing motivates popular opinion quite like a good story and a face to pin it to.\n\nDoing the same with scientific breakthroughs is more difficult than in sports, but by no measure is it impossible. Scientists and engineers like Einstein and Edison are revered for their knowledge and innovation, creating brilliant theories and inventions with what tools they had at the time. With the sheer rate of scientific advancement in today's Cold War world, the selection of potential figureheads for America's newfound interest in the sciences spans a wide range. Astronauts, test pilots, inventors, biologists - the frontiers of mankind's knowledge are being pushed on all sides. By attaching a face to these wondrous achievements, we can inspire this nation to look to the future and wonder what's in store."
 USA_hart_68_janey_desc: "In 1961, a bold study by NASA selected twenty-five women to undergo a rigorous set of exercises in order to determine if women really had what it took to be astronauts. The results were surprising: thirteen passed the examinations with flying colors. These \"Mercury 13\" never made it into the astronaut program, but the example they set has overturned all conventional wisdom on the subject. One of those extraordinary women went on to marry the man who now sits in the Oval Office.\n\nJane Hart first discovered her love of flying during WW2 and went on to become the first woman in Michigan to obtain a helicopter pilot's license. When her husband, Phillip Hart, entered politics, \"Janey\" would make waves by flying him to and from campaign events. A nonconformist and trailblazer, she is the model for the new American woman.\n\nIt's high time for President Hart to make his wife the centerpiece of some of his new initiatives on gender equality. She may have not flown into space, but Jane Hart will inspire America's girls to reach for the stars."
 USA_hart_68_after_hours_study_hall_desc: "For the average middle-class K-12 student, the seven hours of mandatory schooling they receive is a chore that must be gotten over with as quickly as possible. But for the countless children of meager means, school is something entirely different: a place of refuge, perhaps from a broken family or crushing poverty. To those children, we must expand upon their opportunities by allowing them to stay at school for extra hours, through so-called \"study hall\" programs. This way, America's teachers will have the opportunity to be the mentors that its disadvantaged children desperately need - and give them overtime pay in the process. A win-win for everyone."
 USA_hart_68_expand_the_public_school_program_desc: "For more than a decade, policymakers and concerned parents have wondered why Johnny can't read. We claim to be a city upon a shining hill, and yet, for a noticeable chunk of our population, a good education remains hard to find. There are places within this country where there are barely any schools for miles around, and many are falling through the cracks. We must do everything in our power to fill the education deserts in America, and once that's done, then we can start worrying about how to improve the schools we already have. President Hart will direct the Department of Education to transfer additional funds to the states for the construction of new schools in underserved communities. Hopefully, nobody will have to ask again why Johnny can't read."
 USA_hart_68_on_ice_desc: "If America is to once again become a shining city upon a hill, she must not close herself off, but share her light with all the world. Ever since the War, academia has been walled off between the various spheres of the superpowers, hindering the exchange of ideas and promoting insularity. Reversing this trend may not fully be possible while the Cold War rages, but the Japanese may be amenable to a less radical proposal: organize a series of international \"olympiads\" in subjects such as math, chemistry, physics, etc. that students from all over the OFN and Co-Prosperity Sphere alike can participate in. By channeling our competition into more peaceful activities, we can cool the tensions between the United States and Japan... and show the world what America's youths are truly capable of. Let's just hope the studious Orientals don't wrack up too many victories, or this initiative could blow up in our faces."
 USA_hart_68_intrastate_competition_desc: "Despite our administration's emphasis on cooperation between all sectors of American society, we understand that sometimes a little competition can do wonders. America is a vast nation with hundreds of universities and colleges, and it's easy for even the brightest fish to get lost in such a large pond. Perhaps we could rectify this by formally establishing a series of national \"olympiads\" in subjects such as math, chemistry, physics, etc. that students from all over America can participate in. This way, we will be able to identify the best and the brightest even from a young age, and give them the tools they need to do great things."
 USA_hart_68_open_up_a_world_desc: "In the age of movies, television, and radio, many children look upon books as an antiquated medium of communication and entertainment. Why waste your time staring at words and trying to conjure up an image in your head when you can feast your eyes on the latest Hollywood special effects, no thinking required? Well, it's the last part that's the problem. Books are the whetstones of the mind, and the more children read, the greater the chance of excelling in school and subsequently their careers. We must launch initiatives to get our kids reading books again, in our schools and libraries. Janey could come in handy with this one - the kids just love her. We should give her a special \"storytime\" program on public television, and combine it with an advertising campaign or two. If all the kids are watching the boob tube, perhaps we can make it work for us."
 USA_hart_68_having_fun_isnt_hard_desc: "To the average American, the word \"library\" conjures the image of a silent, boring space not too much different from a funeral home... but this view overlooks all the good they can bring. Public libraries are an oft-neglected yet still valuable service in the American social fabric - a \"node,\" as Secretary Jacobs would say. Not only providing our citizens with free access to the nation's collective knowledge, they also serve as community centers where anyone can spend a few hours after work or school exploring the world of the written word. They are meeting places that draw communities closer together and keep restless youths off the streets. Secretary Jacobs has proposed funding the construction of hundreds of new public libraries across the country, as well as other initiatives to make the library a more attractive and, more importantly, fun place to visit. Storytime, arts and crafts, even vocational training. The sky's the limit."
 USA_hart_68_national_testing_standards_desc: "Though the Hart Administration has done much to promote the improvement of education across America, one remaining flaw in our system that sticks out like a sore thumb is the lack of a consistent measure of a student's progress. Instead, we are stuck with a patchwork of state testing standards of varying quality, many of which fail to evaluate their students adequately on basic skills that they'll need for the 20th century. If we can't know which students are falling behind, how can we possibly hope to give them the help they need?\n\nThis next step is going to be quite possibly the most radical reform the Hart Administration will put forth in regards to education. We will propose the establishment of a national set of standardized tests that all schools across America will use to evaluate students. Called the National Educational Testing Standard, or NETS for short, this move will represent an unprecedented expansion of federal authority over education - a field traditionally regarded as the domain of the states. Of course, such an act will undoubtedly infuriate America's most ardent defenders of states' rights, and even alienate moderates by raising the threat of \"big government overreach.\" However, President Hart knows that the adoption of NETS is the only way to truly guarantee the competitiveness of our schoolchildren compared to their counterparts in Germany or Japan. It's one small step, but a giant leap for America."
 USA_hart_68_pastures_of_innovation_desc: "At first glance, one would not notice the relationship between science and agriculture. However, their relationship is becoming intertwined. As agricultural scientists innovate the fields, farmers around the world will have better crop yields. Better crop yields lead to better profits for farms of all sizes. Better profits makes everyone happy.\n\nThe Hart Administration will facilitate this ripple effect. It all starts in the pastures of innovation."
 USA_hart_68_domestic_revolution_desc: "In the halls of MIT, Rutgers, Texas A&M, and hundreds of colleges across the country, the students of science are making breakthroughs. One field of study making strides is agriculture, much to the pleasure of American farmers. Each harvest provides access to better equipment, seeds, and fertilizer than the last. As such, this unlikely relationship between humble farmer and august academic is one that the Hart Administration has an interest in fostering."

If the Hart Administration doesn't deliver on its rural promises. Rural America will flock to the opposition.\n\nIt is a necessity to ward off those who wish to cut down our ambitious policies. Our ammunition is political capital, and we will expend it to protect our policies."
 USA_hart_68_thread_and_needle_desc: "Fertilizer seems pretty straightforward, no?\n\nWrong! Fertilizer is fantastic, and it is only getting better. Scientists are innovating boring old fertilizer to produce results we've never seen before. Meaning a farmer can spend less to produce even more crop yield in a harvest. It will, unfortunately, take time to catch on. No big deal, it will be in widespread use by the next election cycle. That's all that really matters...right?"

For the last half-decade, rural voters have been flocking to the NPP and its populist rhetoric. Our administration has not made things better, our heavy focus on urban renewal has made many ruralites feel left behind. Before we push further on our urban agenda. It is necessary to address the worries of our fellow Americans outside of the city. In doing this, we will create a coalition between the urban and the rural that will harken back to the days of Roosevelt."
 USA_hart_68_treading_lightly_desc: "Let's revolutionize the way we farm. The men and women of agriculture shouldn't have to unnecessarily toil in the fields doing labor a machine can. Urban Americans live in the lap of luxury, it's time our farmers are given the ability to work smarter instead of harder.\n\nSynthesized fertilizer, hardy seeds, modernized Tractors. These are but a few of the wonderful advancements that will be made easily accessible for the farmers of America."

Rural flight has been an unfortunate reality that has plagued America for decades. Regrettably, our administration has turned a blind eye to this...\n\nIt is high time to set things right and address the stem issue causing rural flight. A lack of opportunity. We will flood rural America with money for social programs, education, resources, electrification, the whole nine yards. Rural America is the heart of America, and if it remains poor, then we as a nation are penniless."
 USA_hart_68_ink_and_skin_desc: "There is not an American today who is unaware of the Civil Rights Movement. The long-standing struggle of the Black community to achieve equality in America has ebbed and flowed since its beginnings a century ago. From Frederick Douglass to W.E.B Du Bois to Martin Luther King Jr. to innumerable others, the brave actions of Black men and women in the face of vast discrimination and brutality is nothing short of incredible. After far too long, civil rights legislation has been devoted to breaking racism's most evident bindings, ending segregation, denial of constitutional rights, and workplace discrimination. To many in America, this signaled the culmination of the fight. Inequality had been defeated, and the country could rest, heal, and relax. Such is the hope of the majority of Americans who are now more interested with law and order rather than further racial conflict.\n\nUnfortunately, the spirit of Jim Crow still lives on in the weeds of America, away from the eye of John Q. Public. It lives on in redlining, in secret covenants to maintain segregation, in the dogwhistles and unfair policies. No, discrimination isn't dead - it's just gotten smarter, and we must get smarter to oppose it effectively.\n\nTo many White Americans, President Hart's promise to further the fight for equality evokes nervous shifting in their seats. What does he mean when he says he's going to balance the programs of the New Deal? What is the White House planning when they talk about housing inequality or urban renewal? Is this going to affect their neighborhoods, their ways of life? All this and more means the President's road will not be any easier than his predecessors. It will require sacrifice, compromise, and disappointment. What it will result in, if successful, is a more perfect union for everyone - and if that isn't worth the effort, then there isn't much that is."
 USA_hart_68_the_game_of_life_desc: "There is an ancient Chinese \"four-character idiom\" that speaks to the ultimate end goal of Philip Hart, now that he is President of the United States. Its literal translation is \"rich-country-peace-people\", and as one might expect it means a reality in which the country is prosperous and the people are at peace. Whereas we are working to build this reality within the United States through tireless labors in education, desegregation, and transportation throughout the country, it will all be for nothing if we cannot manage to fix the most basic problem beleaguering many of our cities: that many people simply don't have the opportunity they sorely need to do well in the game of life.\n\nSo many Americans, especially in the cities, are forced to move from one house to another by scoundrel landlords and the vagaries of employers. Worse yet, they struggle to find jobs, which in turn destroys their financial security, and thus forces them to prioritize the most basic, primal needs of survival over other meritorious things crucial for their own success and that of their children. How is this a good thing? How does this resemble the great American Dream? If we let things carry on like this, are we truly any better than the fascists and the Yamatos?\n\nObviously, we will not wait a moment longer. People need a house, a job and an education. They need a solid place to call their home, so they can peacefully raise the next generation. It is our duty to secure a simple life for our people; we will not fail or falter in this."
 USA_hart_68_Making_America_desc: "The essence of Fascist Italy at its inception was blind adherence to the \"King-Emperor\" and the Duce (or \"Douche\", as DOS staffers like to call him). The essence of Germany is an even more blind devotion to race, to genocide, and to the Fuehrer. The essence of Japan is psychotic ultranationalism, worship of that bookish marine biologist they call an Emperor, and colonialist brutality that might even give King Leopold pause. What, then, is the essence of America?\n\nIt is simple: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...\"\n\nYet at the same time, to our undying shame, we must remember another set of words. \"What, to the slave, is your Fourth of July? ... To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\"\n\nOur work will not be complete unless we can prove these words wrong, and make it so that all Americans, regardless of race, can partake in the freedoms handed down to us by the Founding Fathers."
 USA_hart_68_cultivating_a_community_desc: "In the places many of our ancestors called home - Europe, Africa, Asia - the power was often held in the hands of a lot of indifferent grandees far away from where many of the ordinary people lived. If there was a disaster, or a famine, or problems with lawbreakers, the people would often have to break their necks and backs going to the gates of the palace for help, only to be thrown out. Even if they were not sent away, their pleas could often be - and often were - ignored by preoccupied politicians, overextended bureaucrats, or put-upon rulers. When this was not due to ill-will, such inaction was often because of a simple inability to do anything about the problem.\n\nBut many of the Native American communities, just like the most successful local communities in the Old World, knew better than to rely on far-away powers for all but the most intractable issues. Instead, they took refuge in one another and relied on the tools and people they had in the closest locality - maybe no more than a five- or ten-mile radius - to see their problems solved. They built connections of friendship and family with one another, and grew used to one another, thus developing a synergy that governments and supranational bodies often sorely lack.\n\nAll this reflects the reality that the most responsive of all governing bodies is a community, especially a local one. Another reality we need to reflect on is that there aren't enough of such things in the United States. We need to do something about this, and quickly; by enabling the building of strong local communities, we cut the burden on the government. At the same time, crime will recede and business will boom."

Local branches of national - or, God forbid, multinational - companies simply do not compare in terms of raw benefit to their surroundings.\n\nEven in the President's own experience, the businesses that allowed this or that national brand to taint them were nothing compared to the mom-and-pop stores that competed with them. That's why he, and a lot of his closest friends and confidants too, like to say things like \"You gotta love local business!\"\n\nThe President has determined that now is a perfect time to prove that those words are more than mere talk. By seeing local businesses grow, we will see local wealth and the power of the American dollar grow at the same time."

But before that the regular rhythm of Senate work, tours of the constituency, and family time was a consolation that stood him in good stead during his tenure.\n\nPresident Hart knows for a fact that many other Americans feel the exact same way (though he notes their jobs are probably very different from any he's ever taken up). Clocking in and clocking out—such a work schedule is a great basis for the American worker to base his week on. That kind of regularity, and the benefits thereof, will in turn also encourage people to work at all in the first place, which in turn will increase the effectiveness of the millions of labor-hours put in by Americans every day."
 USA_hart_68_the_future_is_you_desc: "Through the millennia of human history and into the present-day, Earth's various peoples have preserved local cohesion through activities in their home communities and regions.\n\nFor instance, the old towns of Southern Spain gather in 'brotherhoods' during Holy Week every year to perform Passion plays and carry great statues of Christ and the Virgin Mary. We are told that the Muslims congregate in groups at the end of their version of Lent, Ramadan, to eat sweet and savoury foods in amounts larger than they ate during the entire month before.\n\nIn many countries, all one needs is a field and a goalpost—or, failing that, some shoes—and then they can get to playing soccer (or 'football' as they call it for some reason). Similarly, given what little we have heard from the ruins of Russia, we know that one of the few things that unite those squabbling statelets is enjoyment of the old, great game of chess. And President Hart has been told by James Abourezk of small towns in Syria that speak the language Christ Himself spoke, held together across religious boundaries by their study of and love for that language.\n\nWe, in America, have our own share of such activities, too—but we need more of them, for all Americans young and old. The communities we have mentioned before hold together because they eat, work, play, and in some cases pray together. We, too, can and must encourage this, for as we have made clear this entire time, the strength of community is incredible."
 USA_hart_68_the_flood_gates_desc: "We have, at last, completed the long work of crafting an effective recipe for the construction of successful American communities able to match and surpass the cohesion, achievement, and economic output of the best in our country and its neighbors and rivals.\n\nBy a combination of, among other things, promoting work scheduling, strengthening community cohesion, pouring funds into community activities, and backing local business, we have created communities capable of guiding themselves, make their own money, and in general simply further the work that we have put into ensuring the best they can possibly be.\n\nHaving succeeded in this, it is time for us to receive in turn fruits for our labor.\n\nAs the farmer labors over a single plant or tree and receives in due time the return for his or her diligent work, so we too will be able to oversee the successful economic results of our tireless efforts. We have ensured that the children and the elderly will be able to live out their lives in greater peace than ever before, and that the people that come into the workforce both public and private will be healthier, happier, and more loyal to the United States and its ideals than they were in the past."
 USA_hart_68_americas_sport_desc: "The Japanese and Germans, when they can crack jokes without getting the Kenpeitai or the Gestapo on their asses before they say \"I worship my head of state as if he was the Lord God Himself,\" love to make fun of American football. Hell, even the Canadians and Cubans do it; in fact, easily 99% of the foreigners that know about football run around making fun of how it allegedly amounts to running around with an egg that never touches the person's feet.\n\nThankfully, we in the White House don't stake our nation's honor over what American football is and is not—rather, we prefer to express our pride in a sport with a far greater international reach: baseball.\n\nRecently, it has become clear to us that baseball could do with far greater investment: we deem that the solution is simple—give it more funding. People have poisoned themselves with partisanship and paranoia; we need to incite them to lay down their brickbats and pick up a baseball. Let them fight for their local sports team rather than their damned old political party, and at the same time strengthen the bonds within their communities."
 USA_hart_68_sundown_desc: "Despite the recent progress of the United States government in the work of preserving civil rights, there are some extremely bold instances of racial discrimination that continue to take place in defiance of the declarations of the White House, the Supreme Court, and the United States Congress. Some of the most flagrant cases of these across the country have the presumption to outright ban racial minority groups from even existing within certain cities; these are the so-called 'sundown laws.'\n\nSundown laws have effectively butchered any method of nurturing any sort of racial justice within the cities that have them, even after the recent movements by the United States Government towards civil rights. Obviously, if this is permitted to continue, more horror stories of lynchings and other harassment will make their way to our desk, and the country will be ever-further destabilized. Therefore, President Hart and the White House leadership have undertaken to ban these at best deeply problematic diktats nationwide."
 USA_hart_68_the_parade_desc: "Fiscal stimuli are frequently suggested during times of economic crisis - the government pours money into this or that district or sector to ensure it stays alive (if not thrives) into the short and medium term. However, it has also been that such fiscal stimuli can be used to seize the moment brought about by this or that policy—to provide governmental support for a fledgling socioeconomic venture in which the State believes.\n\nThis latter type of stimulus is what is on the bill currently going through the United States Congress. Communities in cities participating in the current Urban Renewal Initiative will, via major financial stimulus packages, be granted federal backing in their plans to expand construction in local sites.\n\nIf this can be brought about, it will not only strengthen the local economy but bring about vital cultural change in the exact direction America needs to outcompete the Nazi and Japanese menaces."
 USA_hart_68_midnight_basketball_desc: "Local youth-targeted activities, funded and promoted by people from the communities in question, will keep youth that are out late on the streets from doing malicious things born out of poverty.\n\nIf an inner-city kid is out with his friends making himself practice his feints and triple threats for the midnight basketball game coming up next Friday, he will be too busy to sample drugs or harass his classmates. If someplace else a young man has forced his nose into a book because the janitor keeps beating him every which way in evening chess club meetings and he wants to try and leverage Fischer or Capablanca's tactics to regain his honor, he'll have absolutely no time to try any of these life-ruining substances or worse yet to sell them.\n\nIt's really quite simple. If the youth just have to be out late on the streets, it's best that they be with others playing harmless games and growing that way, rather than being corrupted into learning things that will send them into the cold grave far sooner than is just for kids their age."
 USA_hart_68_lampposts_desc: "Since the early Greek and Roman times, lampposts (or 'street lights' as some officialistic pedants like to call them) have been a tool of great use to civil society and the state. Whatever unnamed ancient genius came up with the idea immediately saw results: the new contraptions lit up roads well enough where people had a clear path from point A to point B at night with a reduced risk of coming a cropper or being attacked without prior notice.\n\nYears have passed and we find ourselves in a far different time and place from the first users of the lamppost. Yet their use—and that of lighting on streets in general—remains obvious. If a street is dark, crime proliferates, injuries are frequent, and surveillance is rendered ineffective; if the street is well-lit, none of those are the case.\n\nLamp-posts are cheap, well-tested, and easy to install. It would be asinine for us not to move quickly on getting them implemented."
 USA_hart_68_in_action_desc: "Over the past few years the Hart Administration has done quite a lot to irritate the various assorted debt hawks in the United States Congress and civil society. Their screaming about this or that program—at times motivated by (c)overt racism or fear of losing some precious privilege of theirs—has become so frequent that the administration simply ignores it as background noise and the Beltway flap du jour.\n\nThis time, the debt-heads are foaming at the mouth like so many rabid raccoons because of the recent proposal to relieve some cities of the financial burdens the URI expansions are putting on them. Rather than forcing the cities to bear the burden alone, this proposal would transfer some of it to the government at a fair, competitive rate.\n\nThe fiscal hardliners look at this proposal and see 'blatant financial waste and adventurism', but they are as always flat out wrong: there is no choice for us but to move quickly to protect these cities from bankruptcy. Otherwise, the spending we in Washington directed them to ear-mark will do them in. The growing pains of the new American cities deserve our full attention. Only an irresponsible fool or an ill-willed villain would ignore them."
 USA_hart_68_the_crime_bill_desc: "Crime is the worst of all the everyday disasters that the average American and his or her government at all levels of society are forced to face. It takes many forms—drug-selling and possession, human trafficking, murder, sexual and physical assault, theft—and all of these are disastrous for society and damaging to the societal and economic fabric.\n\nContrary to the lies spouted by the Nationalists, we members of the Democratic Party recognize this quite well. Let there be no confusion: the Democrats are, and always have been, tough on crime. Though his concern for the public welfare might provide the assorted hardliners and Axis-lovers in society with an excuse to think differently, our President has never been an exception to this trend.\n\nThe President will now work with the U.S. Congress to draft a crime bill that can see a suitable plummet in criminal activity in cities, combined with proper enforcement. The most important focus of this bill will be less on preventing criminals from thriving than it will be on protecting innocent, law-abiding citizens of the United States of America."
 USA_hart_68_listen_bud_desc: "When a lazy teenage boy is given the \"onerous\" task of taking out the weeds in the garden, he will not ask for the weed-puller and get rid of them root and stem. Instead, he will run around with a shovel or some such and knock the heads and stems off the plants, leaving their roots completely untouched and allowing them to grow back in force several days later.\n\nThis is a perfect metaphor for the current strategy of drug enforcement. In too many cities, the average policeman uses draconian punishments on people possessing drugs without asking one word's worth of questions about who gave them the drugs.\n\nFortunately, we have a way to uproot the problem rather than just nip it in the bud. Direct security attention away from the folks possessing drugs and instead tackle the people giving them drugs, as in the planters and dealers. These scum are the source of the crime of possession; cutting them off from business would necessarily mean a decline in possession charges throughout the country."
 USA_hart_68_youth_employment_opprotunities_desc: "Let's not kid ourselves; the youth are the lifeblood of this nation and its future. To pretend otherwise would be a denial of not just our future - but our inevitable mortality as well. We're getting this country out of the jam our contemporaries put it in, but we can't do it alone. When your car gets stuck inside a rut, you don't get it out by simply flooring the gas pedal and hoping for the best. No, you get your passengers out; they push with all their might while you drive it out of the hole. That's why this country needs all hands on deck to get its economy back on its feet.\n\nEmployment courses, skill training and interning opportunities are just some things that we can offer our kids to prepare them for the future that we're creating. Not only does this keep them straying from the path of gang activity and homelessness, but it will also make sure that our heirs will do an even better job than we have of preparing their kids, as well."
 USA_hart_68_all_of_gods_children_desc: "It's simply a fact that some people are just more vulnerable to society's great ills - homelessness, drug abuse and crime - than other folks. It's a tragedy of the human condition, but it's part of it nonetheless. What isn't a fact is this inhumane notion that we should leave these people - our fellow man - to the wayside to rot in the churning dustbin of obscurity while we press on. What sets America apart from the Nazis is that we are not a nation built on callous greed and murderous hierarchy. To be sure, to know that a part of our nation is suffering and choosing not to do anything about it is murder. That is a choice, don't fool yourself.\n\nMy Presidency will not be a cruel one. Senators and Congressmen want to talk about getting people off welfare. What better way than to increase it until the baton passes and our thriving job market can genuinely uplift people from destitution? This does two things: it helps our economy bound to new heights but also allows us to spend less on welfare once our huddled masses have finally taken the liberty they so yearned for."
 USA_hart_68_review_sentencing_desc: "The only thing worse than making a mistake is denying that a mistake was made. We can acknowledge that our crime bill may be... too harsh, in some places. But that's okay- we can revise and rebuild it, trimming the fat while adding new and improved bits to better suit our needs. Maybe we punished petty crime too much, or completely focused on the wrong things- regardless of where we messed up, we have the rare opportunity to fix it, while still keeping the spirit and goal of the bill- to crack down on crime."
 USA_hart_68_zip_it_lock_it_desc: "How many debt hawks does it take to make the world a better place? None, they didn't want to spend tax money on an exploratory committee to brainstorm solutions.\n\nA rather unruly, vocal minority has formed across party lines, they are concerned at the enormous price tag our urban renewal is costing us. Hampering our ability to push benchmark bills through congress. To give into these debt hawks would render our goals defunct, and even make us lose progress. Therefore we must work hard to make the debt hawk agenda difficult to attain. It might get dirty at times, but it will be a necessity if we want our urban renewal to pack some punch."
 USA_hart_68_breaking_the_red_bars_desc: "On every map, there are lines; they represent national or state borders, roads, rivers, or mountains. They come in a variety of colors- blue, green, yellow. There is one kind of line, however, that should not exist on maps in President Hart's America- Redlining.\n\nRedlining, a holdover from America's racist past, is the practice of withholding certain services from neighborhoods or parts of cities that are deemed \"dangerous\" for those in charge of providing them. It is no coincidence, of course, that these \"lower income neighborhoods\" tend to be primarily African American.\n\nWe must put a stop to this unethical practice."
 USA_hart_68_alterative_movement_desc: "Buses, bikes, boots, boats, trains, trolleys, and trams. These are all alternatives to driving. The Hart Administration wants its cities to be a beacon of alternative transport. Driving won't have to be the only option to go to a concert, club, or wherever an urbanite wishes to go. It will also help keep people in shape, the option to walk is a big factor in health. So quite literally, it is a public health matter to present alternative forms of transport for the American people.\n\nWhether it is bike lanes, bus lanes, or elevated tracks. We will leave all options on the table for urban planners and architects."
 USA_hart_68_forever_mitus_desc: "Like their namesakes, they silently circle their prey, waiting for the opportunity to strike. They move silently, just under the waterline of the law, able to ruin lives. But people need them; people need the loan shark. By making it easier to get a real loan from a real bank, we will curb the overreliance on loan sharks and other shady figures that many impoverished communities face- and thus, solve two problems at once. This also plays into President Hart's banking reform- making banks more common and better staffed will allow wealth to flow into cities and into the pockets of those who had been previously denied it."
 USA_hart_68_americanist_cities_desc: "America is built on freedom and equality; it is in our founding documents, of course. Some American cities, however, do not reflect this honored tradition. Whether it is because of the sickly legacy of slavery and segregation, or the less violent (but still racist) redlining and gentrification, there are towns and cities all across the United States that are still starkly unequal for those of a different skin tone, or a variety of other things. We must tackle this issue; and rip out the weed from its root. Architecture that specifically elevates one group will be rebuilt- in Hart's America, all groups must be on the same footing.\n\nEveryone deserves the reach the American Dream."
 USA_hart_68_never_too_much_desc: "This might be a pyrrhic victory, but we scrounged together enough votes to force our bill through congress. This bill is everything we dreamed of for Public Housing. A multitude of subsidies, dozens of contracts to build new affordable housing, and money for much-needed maintenance and overhauls.\n\nNow, comes the bad part, we've unfortunately evoked the ire of the opposition. Debt Hawks are already angrily protesting on the floors of the House and Senate. All that matters, however, is that the people know we did this, and will hopefully vote in the next election. Nevertheless, President Hart has acknowledged that politics is a tough game, and we have claimed a small, hard-fought victory."
 USA_hart_68_rmoney_desc: "While it is not the housing bill we wished for, this modified version of the housing bill has the backing of George Romney and a gaggle of Republicans. Thus giving it some added legitimacy. The bill includes coverage for new public housing and overhauls for current dilapidated housing. It doesn't go the extra mile to provide maintenance and a plethora of subsidies.\n\nHowever, it did not invoke the ire of Debt Hawks and our own party. Beggars can't be choosers, we will take what we can get."
 USA_hart_68_rebuilding_the_bank_desc: "In the days of cowboys, sheriffs, and gold rushes, a town's post office was the most important building within it. Part bank, part meeting house, they were often the first part of a town constructed; or, in other cases, towns would simply spring up around them. They were the center of these old Western towns, often both literally and figuratively. President Hart wants to return to this echo of America's past. By once again allowing post offices to function as banks would solve a lot of problems presented to us by other, private banks. Not every town has the wealth or affluence for one of the fancy private banks to set up shop- but every town, simply by necessity, has a post office. In addition, having these banks be federally mandated will allow us to crack down on any sort of discriminatory policies taking place."
 USA_hart_68_the_chicken_hawks_desc: "Over the past few years the Hart Administration has done quite a lot to irritate the various assorted debt hawks in the United States Congress and civil society. Their screaming about this or that program has become so frequent that the Administration simply ignores it as background noise and the Beltway flap du jour. However, despite what some might surmise from this, we are not completely inattentive to them. In fact, we have developed an ability to tell several types of them apart.\n\nSome budget hawks just hate spending, period, and stand no hope of being convinced. Others, however, are mere budget contrarians—hence why they get called 'chicken hawks' at times. Rather than just generally shouting about waste, these individuals say, \"Don't waste money on A, spend money on B instead!\" By definition, therefore, these fellows are far easier to deal with than their hardline compatriots.\n\nLet us make some concessions to calm them down. We can give an earnings report, or boast about the sustainability of their programs that we have implemented. Between these, the fiscal contrarians will be shut up well and finely for a good while."
 USA_hart_68_stability_starts_at_home_desc: "Today we will completely misappropriate a quote of the Turkish President, Kemal Attaturk, who said that his policy consisted of 'peace at home, and peace in the world'. Though we believe in that in the sense that he and his Republican People's Party meant it, we also believe in it in a different sense that is, as it were, \"closer to home.\"\n\nThe ability of any person, no matter their origin, to compete in the world relies on what they call home. Those with happy and prosperous households (regardless of wealth, for wealth alone does not make true prosperity) tend to have a far more advantageous initial trajectory than those with a broken home life. With a stable home life, one is enabled to face the world with strength—\n\n—and it is our duty to cultivate a city, a Nation, where that is available to all. If, thanks to our work, the USA becomes known as a place that successfully nurtures its children, the whole world— even the egomaniac genocidaires in Germania and Tokyo—will be forced to look to us for an example."
 USA_hart_68_new_incentives_desc: "These days the Hart Administration is being treated to a resurgence of one of the most annoying—not to mention dangerous—talking points that modern American governments have to cope with.\n\nLarge groups of people, especially social and fiscal conservatives, are complaining that President Hart's programs will disincentivize people from working because they can instead \"rely on the government to give them money\". They spread panic about welfare queens and lazy homeless bums in order to support their unrealistic viewpoint.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that that is not how things work, the cities and their funding must be defended lest the budget hawks tear them to bits while we aren't watching. We must make clear to these naysayers, especially the ones within our governing coalition, that the Hart Administration—no-one else—has brought cities from rags to riches specifically because of the strength of American labor."
 USA_hart_68_by_and_for_desc: "What's the point of producing all this fancy new equipment if we just ship it off to another country, never to be seen again? No, cities that produce appliances and tools should be encouraged to use them within those very own cities- even if it's just for efficiency's sake. \"Made in America\" is hugely important, of course; but \"Used in America\" is even more so. The local use and production is important as well; it should not have to be sent to some central warehouse in Idaho in order to be shipped back to the city from which it came- from the city that needs it.\n\nPresident Hart argues that the process of transporting this much-needed equipment from producer to consumer should be streamlined, rather than relying on existing (and quite antiquated) systems.\n\nIt must be rebuilt from the ground up."
 USA_hart_68_toss_the_dice_desc: "Now that the Hart Administration has dealt with public housing, it is time to go after housing itself. The last vestiges of segregation can be seen in the housing market. Whether it is the act of redlining, or the urban wealth actively pestering their towns to keep minorities from moving in. We will focus our efforts on overturning these subtle acts of racism, and making sure every American has an equal opportunity to live in the community they want to live in.\n\nIt will be an uphill battle, but so has every other challenge this Administration has taken on."
 USA_hart_68_uniquely_american_desc: "There is a uniqueness to American Racism that makes it extra hurtful. It is mundane, it slowly saps away opportunity from inner cities. It is seen in the black soldiers who step up to liberate the oppressed people of the world and come home to a country that forces them to sit in the back of the bus. It is seen on water fountains, 'concerned' parents who don't want their children going to school with people of different colors.\n\nWe have handicapped the racism gripping the south for generations, and with a little more effort we can keep it down for good."
 USA_hart_68_wave_2_desc: "When a tsunami recedes, it only comes back stronger. The same can be said for our urban renewal projects. We have given some time for the first wave to yield results, and now it is time to send in the second wave. New loans, more bike lanes, improved public transport, trees, trees, and a few more trees! Whatever a city needs, we will provide it. Housing? Zoning reform? We'll go the extra mile and give juicy contracts to construction companies. We will make sure the American city will be the envy of the world!"

The Republicans and Nationalists in Congress have been on the prowl, lookin' for ways to demolish whatever Chep doesn't bulldoze himself. Even our old friends in the press have been houding us, eager for sensationalistic stories about Zsa Zsa and all that.\n\nIt's a lot but we can't let it get to us. Just take a deep breath, smile as we always do, and show people what you're capable of. We're no Philip Hart, but we can still show that we have what it takes to lead."
 USA_chep_The_Better_desc: "To get the cabinet in line, we gotta start by winning over our most vocal opponents. We're not talkin' Kissinger, that ass-kissing bastard, or Lansdale. We're talkin' the mother of all Northern elites, Jane Jacobs.\n\nIt's been no secret that we haven't always seen eye to eye. Jane has—unfairly—always thought of us as a huckster and a charlatan, a holdover from an early age of Southern Democratic politics. We, on the other hand, have always seen Jane as a kind of pencil-necked brainiac who has no goddamn idea how hard it is to get anything done in this country. Still, we have one thing in common—we both loved Philip. Let's see if we can work together, this one time, to save his legacy."
 USA_chep_Mannish_Man_desc: "People often say marriage is tough but never how tough. It forces you to make sacrifices you never thought you'd have to make. It turns you into a person you can't recognize in the mirror. It leaves you feeling all hollow inside. Sometimes we lay awake at night and wonder if the Kennedys ever felt the same way...\n\nBut this isn't about them. This is about Zsa Zsa. We've tried to be patient and understanding, but things haven't been good between us for a long while. She's said things, hurtful things, to the press. She's lashing out, looking for a way to hurt us and the country. Given Jane's advice, we know we can't ignore this any longer. We gotta talk to her and reach an understanding."
 USA_chep_Gold_and_Silver_desc: "We've dealt with budget hawks for a long time. Hell, it was exactly these kind of folks we dealt with in Louisiana, always sayin' \"no\" to projects 'cause they lacked the imagination to see what was beyond their noses. Washington's no different. In fact, it might be worse.\n\nSince Phil—may God bless him and his family—passed, the usual ragtag group of conservative blowhards have been sitting and plotting. All of 'em, from Goldwater down, have been gunning for the URI, lookin' for ways to tear apart the President's greatest legacy. They know they can't repeal it all, not so long as we hold the veto pen, but they can always underfund it so it withers on the vine.\n\nWe gotta act fast to nip this threat in the bud before it's too late."
 USA_chep_Domino_Theory_desc: "Oh hell, they're going for it. They're going for the URI. They aren't even waiting until Philip's cold yet. Those bastards. Those conservative sons of bitches. The cocksuckers.\n\nIt's time to pull out every name in the rolodex, every card that Hart left us behind to stop this. We need everyone from the cabinet to the common man to assemble and show that this act is unacceptable. Only through a massive show of public support can we save the URI from destruction. Let's see if we still have any charm left to pull this kind of rescue mission off."
 USA_chep_Demons_in_the_Cave_desc: "Look, we've always thought of ourselves as a friend to all races. The Blacks, you know how they are, benefited from a lot we did as Mayor of New Orleans and Governor, even aren't happy about it now. We brought in a lotta new business. We cleaned up a lotta crime. Goddamn it, we did what we thought was right at the time. We didn't know all this \"gentrification\" and \"police brutality\" thing that Jane is always barking about now.\n\nBut... look, we know we're not these people's first choice. Philip was. And if we're gonna live up to Philip's legacy and hold together what he built, then we're gonna need to fess up to what we did a long time ago. We're not the ideal candidate for this kind of flower-child \"healing and reconciliation\" thing, but maybe we can reach an understanding with the groups most likely to oppose us."
 USA_chep_Big_Talk_desc: "Did you fellas hear about how Chep Morrison was one of the folks pushing hardest for the highway improvements? Did you know that Philip Hart came to Chep first about the Americar? How about how Chep used his experience from New Orleans to build the URI and the Crime Bill? The environmental reforms?\n\nIf there's one thing we and Zsa Zsa have always excelled at, it's been the razzle dazzle—inflating the truth just a little bit to win support from the rubes in the crowd. While we've often done this for less than selfless reasons, here it's gonna be important to get us the political capital we need to survive the next few months. If people think we were the one always making decisions side-by-side with Hart, then they might be a little more accepting of us at the Resolute Desk. Let's just hope Janey Hart doesn't react too badly."
 USA_chep_Bayhing_Time_desc: "There's all sorts of nasty things that get said about the vice presidency. Thomas Jefferson considered it \"splendid misery.\" Daniel Webster called it a premature burial. Even the South's own John Nance Garner described it as less valuable than a bucket of warm piss. And, sure, all those sayings are witty and memorable and get passed around at fancy parties but that doesn't make 'em true. The last coupla years with Hart have shown that the Vice Presidency can mean a whole hell of a lot if you let it. It's why our first priority has got to be getting our old office filled.\n\nAfter talking it over with the great minds of Congress, it looks like Birch Bayh from the Great State of Indiana is our best pick for a second-in-command. The man is young. He's a great speaker. And he's apparently got a real knack for managing legislation that will be critical if we're to survive in office. Let's offer him the appointment and hope we can get it through the Senate."
 USA_chep_Glass_Houses_desc: "These Senate bastards. These rotten, crooked bastards from the United States Senate, so goddamn miserable about having to live with themselves that they inflict their misery on other people...\n\nOver the last week, the leaders of the greatest deliberative body have marched to the White House and made it clear in no uncertain terms that they don't like us. They consider us a poor replacement for Hart—God bless him—and their constituents feel the same, unsure why a pathetic dandy from Louisiana and his tabloid wife are in the Executive Mansion. It doesn't take an astute observer to know that all this is readying for an assault, not just on our power but on the power of government as well. Soon enough, they'll be trying to tear down the house we built with Hart."
 USA_chep_Without_Reward_desc: "People don't know this—the press like it when we talk about the water-skiing and fancy parties—but we pray every night. We get down on our knees and give a real, old-school Catholic prayer to the Lord on High. Zsa Zsa doesn't like it, she's made comments about it before, but it's a habit that helps us get through the toughest times.\n\nLately, all our prayers have been about the Urban Renewal Initiative. We've been begging God, please let us save this. Please let us do this one good thing for poor Philip. Give us the strength we need to be a good President, to preserve those things that the both of us worked hard for. We'll do whatever you ask. Just let us get through this."
 USA_chep_No_Sleep_desc: "It's been a long time coming, this assault, and no amount of praying was ever gonna stop it. Every corner of the conservative establishment—from the National Review to the American Enterprise Institute—has gathered their forces to loot and pillage this Administration. Their agents march through the Halls of Congress, ready to take down the URI like the old Visgoths took down Rome.\n\nIt's awful, an awful thing. And all we can do is watch as it unfolds. Every day, we pace through the halls of a House we never wanted, surrounded by people who don't like us, in a country that does not know us. We spend sleepless nights pouring Philip's old paper trying to find some secret to fix this whole goddamn mess, to make it turn out all right.\n\nAre we the right man for this fight? Or will we wind up as nothing but a gravedigger of history?"
 USA_chep_Morning_desc: "The assault through the night was long and hard. The hawks came at us with everything they had, corralling senators from all parts of the country to support their URI bill. It could have destroyed us. It could have destroyed Hart—God rest his soul—but we held our defenses. We stopped the bastards at the gates and lived to see a new dawn.\n\nSomething has changed in Washington, with this whole presidency. It's visible in the White House and it's visible from Congress. Everyone knows that Chep Morrison isn't some Southern softie that you can push around. He's gonna use everything he's got to keep this country moving."
 USA_chep_Noon_desc: "Dawn moves toward noon. The sun rises from its lowest point to its highest. Goddamn if it doesn't look gorgeous, if it isn't a beautiful day to entertain a few folks from the good days of the Hart Administration.\n\nThe person we're most interested in entertaining right now is Walter Reuther. When the news first emerged that Philip—may he rest in peace—would hand us the reins, Reuther took a step back. He didn't know if we were friend or enemy, if we had it in us to stand up against the goddamn budget hawks around Congress. Now that he knows we have fight in us, he's willing to mobilize his boys to stop these conservative bastards. The two of us can really work together to show just what the Democratic Party can do when it's united."
 USA_chep_Supper_desc: "The midday turns to dusk. Busy people return from work. They're tired, exhausted, and ready for to let off some steam. More than anything else, they want to be entertained. Lucky for us, Chep Morrison has always been good at that.\n\nAs the conservatives continue their assault on the legacy of Philip Hart—grant him serenity, Oh Lord—President Morrison is going to be on television every night reminding America what it is exactly they're threatening to do. This isn't about numbers on a balance sheet, oh no, it's about starvin' kids getting fed and clean, well-paved roads. We'll use the most outrageous rhetoric we can think of—little ol' ladies being gunned down in the street, families freezing to death in their homes—to remind them of what's at stake here. If we can rile people up, chances are we can spook off some of our opposition."
 USA_chep_Show_Face_desc: "Now comes the end of night and, with it, the end of the whole rotten mess. We've done good stayin' strong, keepin' on the defense. We didn't let the bastards get us down, as Nixon woulda said. And with the enemies repelled, it's time for us to press our case.\n\nIt's not just that Congress wants to kill little ol' ladies and starvin' kids and the homeless, it's that it does nothing except that. What we got in Washington is a Do-Nothing Congress, one so beholden to radicals like Phyllis Schlafly and Barry Goldwater that they're unwilling to do anything to help the American people. We'll talk to reporters about all the things that Congress hasn't been doing—how they killed price controls and they killed any hope of a housing bill. We'll talk about how the only thing on conservatives' minds is making sure poor old Chep is a one-term President."
 USA_chep_TXTICON_desc: "It's done. The conservatives have cokced up all of their chances of meaningfully repealing the URI. They can hold committee hearings and force symbolic votes all day, but all of 'em know that nothing is getting past Chep Morrison's veto pen. All they can do is stamp their feet and cry, the poor bastards. Imagine being some Washington bigshot and getting outgunned by some henpecked Louisiana dandy.\n\nWith the threats ended and the end of our term approaching, we think it's time we do something for ourselves: An Oval Office Address. We're gonna do our first televised address since becoming the President of the United States to show the nation who we are and what we're capable of. Most folks won't think that we have a legacy but what do they know? Saving Hart's URI—God bless him—is enough for us to sleep at night."
 USA_chep_The_Dynasty_desc: "It took everything we had in us, along with the help of a few friends, but we survived an onslaught and made our mark in Washington. There's just one more journey left for us, one last chance to honor a truly great President."

Then came the updates on the oil crisis.\n\n\"It's bad, Mister President.\" The aide informed him, \"Many industries are suffering, as you are aware, but there has been an update.\"\n\nPhil raised an eyebrow, \"Is that so?\"\n\n\"Yes, John Murray of the Association of American Railroads commissioned a report on the rail industry, and it yielded concerning results.\"\n\nThe aide pointed to the Manila folder, Hart opened it. He would have to read the report in full later, but glancing at it, Phil saw the opening sentence. 'The energy crisis to the railroads is like a Get Well Card from an undertaker.

It doesn't matter if they were a freight line or a passenger line, we'll buy it. Then, we put our current and acquired assets into one state-owned company, the Consolidated Rail Administration, ConRail for short. Lastly, while the bureaucracy is being sorted out, we undergo an extensive electrification process for rail lines across the country. Completely bypassing a train's dependence on oil!\"\n\nAfter finishing the presentation, Mike opened the two-man floor to questions.

You say you can get it done in a year, and generate profitability two years after that, but we don't have that kind of time.\"\n\nPhil set down his trusty American Legion mug, then responded to Chep. \"The pamphlet Mike gave us was pretty thorough. I think we can assuage the fears of debt hawks, and, in this time of crisis, we can propel public transport to the forefront. However, I must concede that this is more of a stop-gap than a remedy to the underlying oil crisis.\"\n\nChep, sensing Hart's hesitation, jumped at the opportunity to rebuff him. \"Right, If these railways are struggling to electrify in the first place, doesn't that mean they were destined to fail years before this oil crisis? It's the free market doing its job.\"\n\nPhil pondered the arguments laid out before him, and, after a minute of suspenseful silence, delivered his final verdict."

He wasn't the only one that had the idea of electrification. Many smaller companies, seeing their margins grow concerningly slim, started the process of electrification. According to the report, they had all gone bankrupt before they could complete the process.\n\nMike resolved himself to bring the issue up at the next cabinet meeting, but the window had passed. Bankruptcy had started to affect the mid-tier railways. It was a matter of time until the party was over. Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific stock had been nose-diving the entire day.

Even at his older age, Humphrey was practically bouncing in his seat, drawing papers from folders and spreading them neatly on the table before the comparatively stark-still President. Chep had to wonder if there was a motor strapped to his back. Did he ever get tired?\n\n\"Now, you know as well as I do that a lot of people in the Senate aren't so keen on you as they were on Phil, God bless him. They knew him, they worked with him, they respected him. Now, if you ask me, I think it comes from the perception that Phil was the man putting the ideas out there and you, well...\" He tapped his fingers on the table. \"You were the salesman.\"\n\n\"That's not fair.\" Chep murmured, sipping his coffee. \"I did as much work as anyone. Hell, more than most of the others. You think Gene McCarthy was wearing the pants in that cabinet?\"\n\n\"I worked with Gene long enough to know better.\" Humphrey smiled. \"But that's the thing. The Senate can take a huckster-\"\n\n\"I'm not a huckster either.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. But the Senate can take that if they think he's got a good man with his head on his shoulders besides him. A Phil Hart, if you will. Which is why...\" He pulled yet another folder from his briefcase, slapping it onto the table and violently rattling the coffee mugs. \"I suggest you take Senator Birch Bayh from Indiana as your number two. Good man, committed liberal, focused on women's rights-\"\n\n\"His wife has cancer, doesn't she?\"\n\nHumphrey paused, finally. \"She's been battling it for a few years, yes.

She hated how tense she was- that at the funeral of a man who had become a dear friend to her she wasn't allowed to cry. But she knew that, while all the men who would speak today would be permitted their imperfections, as the highest ranking female cabinet member in history she would not get that luxury. So she stood strong for the memory of her friend.\n\n\"Philip Hart was not a great President, or a great man, because he was always right,\" Jacobs said. \"He was not the leader that he was because he marched forwards under the belief that he had all the answers. He was a great leader because he knew that he was just as human as the rest of us- that he could not change America alone.\" She swallowed, and gave herself a small nod. \"I was introduced to Phil when he contacted me after reading my book. I was expecting the same political nonsense I'd heard a thousand times- flattery, vague promises, the subtle request for an endorsement. But that's not what Phil Hart gave me. He didn't want anything from me. All he wanted was help understanding my ideas- and help understanding how he could apply them to serve the American people.\"\n\nShe allowed herself a snort. \"If you want the truth, if you told me I'd be standing up here, giving a eulogy for a President whose cabinet I'd served in, ten years ago, I'd had laughed in your face. But that's just who Phil was. He was ready to learn from anyone, from the highest academics to the humblest of activists. And I learned from him. I have a lot to thank Phil for- his friendship, the example he set, the opportunity to serve this country. But most of all, I'm grateful that he let me believe again- believe in the promise of America.\""

He was afraid, now that the greatest advances for the poor in the history of America were at risk of slipping away. But America- the people he'd spent his life fighting for- didn't need his fear. So as he gave his eulogy for the greatest protector the American worker had ever known, he looked straight ahead.\n\n\"In the primaries most of the country looked at this newcomer- this outsider from the Great Lakes suddenly trouncing all the party insiders- with confusion. But- I can tell you- not Michigan. We knew who Phil Hart was since he served as our Lieutenant Governor in the 50s. We knew he had integrity and honor, and that he would do everything in his power to fight for the common man. I know I speak for all Michiganlanders when I say it's been a privilege to watch the President show the nation the kind of man he is just as he's shown us. And while I mourn the President's death, I take heart in the knowledge that cancer can kill a man but it cannot kill his legacy. President Hart has entrusted the America he built, an America of equality, of brotherhood, of freedom, to all of us. It's our job to pick up the torch he left us.\"\n\nAs applause rang out in front of him Reuther fought off a scowl. Conservatives probably had enough decency to give the nation one day to mourn. But, he knew, the knives would come out tomorrow. Everything Hart had done would be dragged to the altar of fiscal responsibility. And for everything Reuther had said today, in his heart of hearts he didn't know if the efforts of the American working class would be able to save what they had won."

Because that might have been how most politicians would have done it, but not Phil Hart. He always made sure that I was included in cabinet discussions, that my voice was heard, that my concerns were answered. Sure, we had our disagreements, and the cabinet wasn't always perfect.

The eulogy was the kind of eulogy a President taking over from his dead predecessor was expected to give. Platitudes about duty, honor, and the goodness of America- of the need to come together. It was a eulogy for America. But after it all, Philip Hart was his friend. And he deserved better than this.\n\nChep looked up, not letting his eyes to drift down to the paper. For a few seconds he just stood there, finding the words. \"Phil was the best of us,\" he finally said. \"You know, when you spend so long in government you can forget that the people you were elected to serve are more than just numbers on a ledger- that each and every one of them is a person with hopes and fears and loves. I know I've been guilty of that. But not Phil. Everything that got put on his desk- urban renewal, healthcare, detente- didn't matter. He'd approach all with this... kindness. That's the only thing I can call it. Maybe he wasn't perfect and maybe he made mistakes. But everything he did... he never did it to score political points, or to get one over his enemies. He did it for America.\"\n\nFor a few seconds he floundered, trying to find the words for what he felt. \"You know, I- I'm not like him. I know I'm not. I'm an old Dixiecrat and I peaked when Ike was President. And there were times when... when I made backroom deals, when I went low, when I played politics instead of serving the people. But I guess... I guess he thought I had a place in one of the greatest administrations this country's ever seen.\" Chep felt a lump in his throat; with herculean effort, he swallowed it. \"That's what made Phil Hart the man he was- the President he was. He saw the best in everyone. He saw the best in America. He believed that whatever our weaknesses- whatever our prejudices- we all can be great. So today I invite all Americans- white and black, men and women, old and young, rich and poor- to honor the legacy of my President and my friend by proving him right.\""

I have been out there on Civil Rights and Women's Rights. I've helped get two Constitutional amendments ratified and I'm working on two others.\"\n\nBayh paused, thinking. \"Now, Mr. President.

But I promise you that if you pick me, I'll work and fight as hard as anyone to get things done here in Washington and to make a real difference in the lives of the people in this country just like you and President Hart have done.\"\n\nChep nodded along. Bayh seemed nice enough, handsome too, which never hurt. He'd be a good pick, but he wanted a look at the alternatives. \"Senator, you're a farmer by trade, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, a farm boy from Vigo County, got my first degree in Agriculture.\"\n\n\"Well, you've certainly given me a lot to think about.

What the hell am I gonna do? How'm I gonna pass anything if I can't even get a Vice President?\"\n\nOf all things, it was the dead air which rattled the phone in its stillness that caught the President square in the gut.

Your voice has been one of the most influential and certainly stands out among the chorus of critics so I thought it best to direct my message to you. I am aware of the flaws within the program and welcome the proposed reforms to fill in the cracks and restore proper fiscal discipline.\n\n\"I think it best for the country that we work together on this issue and develop a proper reform bill to be sent to my desk as soon as possible.

For weeks, she had read article after article about the President doing nothing while his vice presidential nominee Birch Bayh languished in Congress. For weeks, she had sat twiddling her thumbs waiting for the President to schedule a cabinet meeting.\n\nNow, many weeks too late, Jane had decided to take matters into her own hands. Dressed in a smart black dress, she strode through the West Wing unannounced, her heels clicking against the tile. Standing with a folder in the lobby, the President did a double take as he saw the small woman make a beeline for him.\n\n\"Long time no see, Mr. President,\" said Jane Jacobs with all the politeness she could muster. \"Any new developments happening in the White House or should I expect to be briefed by the Washington Post once again?\"\n\nThe President opened and shut his mouth several times. \"Jane, I...\" He gulped. A deer stuck in headlights. \"I was just...\" He looked down at the folder in his hands. \"It's Congress. They're gunning for the URI and blocking everything they can.\"\n\n\"Once again, Mr. President, I do find time to read the newspaper every now and then. What I'm more concerned about is what you're doing to stop this.\"\n\n\"I'm still trying to figure that out,\" he said. He placed the folder behind his back like a child trying to hide a bad report card. It looked to Jane like some proposal. \"Just... give me some time.\"\n\nJane Jacobs scowled. She did not suffer fools. \"We're on thin ice, Chep. One false move and that's it for the URI.\""

It was a place with class, a place with culture. With so many diplomats squeezed into one place, all looking for a way to ingratiate themselves to their American hosts, the neighborhood was overflowing with parties and celebrations.\n\n\"My goodness, Mrs. Morrison, aren't you just divine this evening?\" Said a voice. Zsa Zsa turned to see Diana McLellan, Washington gossip columnist standing with a champagne flute and a notepad.\n\nZsa Zsa frowned. \"I think you meant 'First Lady Gabor,' darling.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course! I'm so sorry. It's just, with all the decor, Moulin Rouge is on the mind.\" The woman gave a chuckle but Zsa Zsa was certain the faux pas had not been a mistake.  \"It's incredible that you still find time to attend these parties with all of your very important duties at the White House.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am quite busy,\" said Zsa Zsa with a tight smile. She could tell when someone was playing with her, when someone was fishing for the tabloids. \"Doing all kinds of renovations at the White House, redecorating and helping bring all kinds of beautiful things to Washington. And, of course, parties like these help me relax after a long day helping my darling deLesseps.\" Zsa Zsa needed something to show the woman who was boss. \"Why, just the other day, I was helping my wonderful husband deal with those nasty brutes in Congress. He came to me and just begged for my help to reform the URI or whatever you call it.\"\n\n\"Chep Morrison is asking Zsa Zsa Gabor for help to reform the URI?\" said Diana, her eyes gleaming as she scrawled a note. In the pit of her stomach, Zsa Zsa felt a knot. She wasn't sure what she'd done, but something she'd said would make headlines."

The two of them had been talking through cuts, looking for a way to save the URI by finding parts to offer to the conservatives. By the time he returned to the Oval Office to find a note on his desk, it was already past noon.\n\n\"What in the world is...\" said Chep, as he picked up paper. He scanned the note. There was a \"Dear Mr. President,\" a line about it having been a pleasure to serve, a signature from Jane Jacobs. Chep's eyes went wide as he realized what he was reading. \"Someone—. Someone get the hell in here.\"\n\nThe next hour was a frantic flurry of activity. None of his aides could remember seeing Jacobs come in. None of the calls to her office went through. Chep found himself on the telephone, begging and pleading with Janey Hart until the widow, begrudgingly, surrendered the former secretary's personal DC number. Minutes later, Chep Morrison was sitting at his desk, praying to himself as the phone rang. \"Hello, this is Jane—.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank God, Jane. It's Chep. It's the President. I just got into the office. I just got your note. I don't—. I'm not sure what I did, but I'm sure it's a mistake. What did you—? Why did you...?\"\n\nThere was a long pause on the other end of the line. \"Chep, I don't suppose you've read the Post this morning?\" The voice was dripping with malice. \"'First Lady Reveals Plan to Reform URI.' How exactly will Zsa Zsa be reforming the URI? Using school lunches to pay for diamonds? Selling roads for taffeta dresses?\"\n\nThe President sat in shocked silence.\n\n\"I warned Philip that it was a mistake to keep you on board. You're a disgrace to your office and a disgrace to his memory.\""

In every major newspaper, there seemed to be some condemnation of his administration, some shocking expose into his incompetence. The New York Times had an exclusive interview with Jane Jacobs, in which she called him \"an incompetent troglodyte\" and shared embarrassing details on the Hart Administration. In the Detroit Free Press, anonymous cabinet officials were bad-mouthing his fumbling relationship with them. In the Los Angeles Times, there was an excoriating editorial on how Chep and his wife were \"backcountry hicks\" who had \"demeaned the office of the President.\" There was even a political cartoon of him and Zsa Zsa as The Beverly Hillbillies, driving a car labeled \"Washington\" off a cliff.\n\nAll of it made him want to melt into a puddle under his desk. It was stupid, childish even, but he couldn't understand why they were being so cruel to him. He'd done so much already for Philip—God rest his soul. It seemed that everyone in the world wanted to destroy him.\n\nHe put his head in his hands. This wasn't just about Hart's legacy any more. With Jacobs gone, with his caucus in chaos, he couldn't save the URI any more. All he could do now was survive with whatever trinkets he could carry. If there was going to be any hope of his retrieving some fragments of his and Hart's hard work from the rubble, there would need to be people to take the fall.\n\nSighing, he removed his hands from his face and rummaged through his desk for stationary. It was time to start demanding letters of resignation."

All through the previous weeks, Washington had been rocked by \"resignation\" after \"resignation.\" The text of over a dozen letters thanking the President for the opportunity to serve had dotted the pages of the Washington Post. It seemed inevitable to Kissinger that the President would eventually take him behind the barn too, that he'd force the resignation of his wildly popular secretary to show he wasn't afraid of the media and was carving his own path.\n\n\"No,\" said Kissinger across from Chep. \"I don't think I will.\"\n\nHe looked babyish behind the big desk. The President blinked as he tried to digest what he'd heard. \"I'm sorry? You aren't...?\"\n\n\"I will not resign from the Office of the Secretary of State. If you want me gone, Chep, you will have to fire me.\"\n\nThat a secretary might refuse a direct order was clearly not a possibility Chep Morrison had considered. Kissinger said nothing as the man made a pathetic noise. \"But you aren't—? Why?\"\n\n\"To be blunt, I don't respect you. I don't think anyone you would appoint would be better positioned to preserve our nation's security...\" Kissinger did not mention the other reason, that him being martyred by an unpopular President would only bolster his reputation. Instead, he made a patriotic display for any tapes that might be recording. \"I won't let you destroy Philip Hart's legacy.\"\n\nMoments later, Henry Kissinger found himself in Foggy Bottom, stacking his personal effects into a box. He gave a cool wave to shocked State staffers as security agents escorted him from his office. He made sure he left the building through the main exit, into a throng of snapping cameras and shouting reporters."

It's crazy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll tell you what's crazy...\" Chep was aware that he was shouting, aware that there were aides who could probably hear him through the walls of the Residence, but he didn't care. The world around him was on fire. Congress was eating away at the URI while Jane Jacobs and Henry Kissinger picked away at him in the press. Every day there were angry headlines about his failures, his incompetence, about his inability to lead. There were angry calls and cruel parodies of him on every television station. He couldn't think straight.\n\n\"I didn't come into this marriage to be treated like this,\" Zsa Zsa said. She was pointing her finger. Her eyes were full of hurt. \"I never wanted to be carted off to Washington and have to explain myself to a bunch of uptight, old—.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'll call up Conrad Hilton to see if he'll take back his washed-up, old whore then?\" Chep spat. There was a beat. He looked at Zsa Zsa's face. Furious tears ran down her face. \"I... I didn't mean that.

 chep.cabinetdie.8.desc: "Moonlight illuminated the trees' gentle windward waltz outside the Oval Office window as President deLesseps Story Morrison watched alone in the dark room with glazed eyes. The private residence was too empty, the staff offices were too hostile, if he went for a walk, he'd certainly be shot, and nobody in the world would accept a call from him. For these reasons, on sleepless nights like these, President Morrison lay flat on a couch and watched the night sky. It was perfect, all things considered.\n\nStill, the whole world was not against him. A knock at the office door startled Morrison upright, who suspected that another ambush was afoot. Instead, a small cadre of wellwishers from among his staff appeared bearing gifts. \"We're all worried about you, Mr. President,\" voiced a female staffer, whose face embodied this worry.\n\nThe President forced a smile and waved them off, but they insisted; he didn't look good and needed to eat. \"I'm fine, girls; now just go.\" Bitterness rippled in his voice, but still, they insisted he leave the office. \"We just want to help, Mr. President,\" they said, but the President finally snapped.\n\nChep took the basket from the staffer's hand and dropped it onto the floor, shouting, \"What can you do to help me!? Are you going to put my marriage back together? Save my cabinet, finally make me President? Where? How?\" Silence hung over the group as the President turned on his heel and walked towards the southward window. He came to his knees and leaned against the windows, staring again at the swaying trees. One of the staffers kneeled to reorganize their gift basket, placed its contents on the table, and nudged the others to leave.\n\nOnce they had left, Chep pilfered the basket for its contents and found, packed a the bottom, a flask of whisky. Philip Hart would never have drunk in the Oval Office, but Chep Morrison didn't care; he was barely a President, unlike responsible Hart. There was a man history would remember, thought Morrison, with a tinge of regret. Then, unscrewing the flask, he raised the whisky and offered a toast.\n\n\"To you, Phil.\""

There had been bad blood between them in the past but it was important, given the circumstances, to try to turn over a new leaf in their relationship. Frankly, Chep Morrison needed every ally he could get. They shook hands and awkwardness, tinged with animosity, hung between them.\n\n\"I wanted to say that I regret the bad feelings between us during Philip's time in this office,\" Chep began, attempting to dispel the cloud between them, \"I know I certainly rubbed you the wrong way at times, and I'm sorry for that, but with everything going on I don't think our feud is worth continuing. Truce?\"\n\nJacobs blinked, slightly taken aback by Chep's opening. Some small, uncharitable part of her had never believed Chep was capable of a gesture like this but she didn't mind being surprised. She nodded, her mind moving from the bad blood between them to the issue at hand.\n\n\"I appreciate that, Mr. President. With that being said, I believe the most important thing now is making sure the URI survives past this administration.\" A sad look crossed Chep's face, quickly replaced by a mask of professionalism.\n\n\"I don't want the URI dying on me. That won't be the legacy of this administration, not as long as I can do anything about it.\" Jacobs felt a brief flash of pride, perhaps admiration, for Chep as he took on the whole threat of the failure of the project.

The URI's popularity is down by double digits in some of the most liberal parts of the country and senators don't to go down with it.\" Left unspoken between them, as both were well aware, was how every conservative in the country had taken the opportunity of Hart's death to launch every imaginable attack on the URI.\n\n\"Do you think Morrison will be able to work through it? The Presidency is one heck of a bully-pulpit.\" Even as she asked, Jacobs knew the answer. Chep had been chosen for the Vice Presidency, Hart's handpicked successor, but whether he measured up to the requirements of the Oval Office remained an elephant in the room-sized question mark.\n\n\"I can't be sure,\" Bayh replied, rubbing his chin and trying to be optimistic, \"He's a man on a mission, trying his best to help the country. I like to think someone like that always has a shot but there are many more cynical than me. He can't rule by decree, but Congress won't listen to him, so he's in this limbo.\"\n\nBayh continued but Jacobs drifted away briefly, slightly haunted by the memory of the passion, investment glinting in the eyes of Morrison as he described his plans to fight for the URI. It hadn't been his idea, but he was now one of its staunchest defenders and seemed to have his whole heart in the fight. If the URI died, its blood would not be on Morrison's hands.

At the time, she had chalked it up to the strength of her arguments and force of will, perhaps his cowardice. Now she worried that each time she had stood up to him her victory had come through unknowing exploitation of his dysfunctional relationship.\n\nHart had mentioned it to her, though she had only gotten a full view of the problem now. She had been proud to know the warning signs of such things, but in her ill-will to Chep had turned a blind eye to his situation. Now, however, she knew she had to help him.\n\n\"What do you want out of your marriage, Chep?\" She asked. The President halted mid-sentence, the question requiring a few minutes of careful thought. He was still getting used to her new attitude towards him.\n\n\"I remember with my first wife, Corinne, before she passed,\" He said with wistful, sad smile, \"She wouldn't yell. I didn't feel like I was on thin-ice every moment of my life. I guess it was a normal marriage rather than something truly special. Zsa Zsa and me, we've had some good times, but the lows were...\" He trailed off. Jacobs nodded. He needed to process the problem rather than have Jacobs shepherd him through it.\n\n\"Do you think you can have a normal marriage with Zsa Zsa?\" Chep's eyes dropped. The implicit, underlying follow-up question hung in the air between them as he pondered. Any animosity had disappeared hours ago, replaced by awkward amity.

Something in the man refused to admit that the situation was exactly as it appeared.\n\n\"Chep, do you think I don't see how things are?\" She asked, \"I see how she yells and you don't respond. How she makes decisions and you accept them without a question. She'll leave on a vacation at the drop of the hat and never even pretend to invite you. It's okay to admit that the way she treats you is domineering.\" She halted, seeing Chep's face freeze. She knew she had crossed a line he was not ready for.\n\n\"I love my wife, Ms. Jacobs, but I am the President of the United States. She does not boss me around and I am my own man. I know this marriage can work, it's just a matter of effort, and divorce is out of the question.\" Jacobs didn't like it, but knew when not to push.\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Morrison, but leave some room for yourself too in this marriage. Work is all well and good, but both of you have to be willing to put it in.\" Chep nodded but Jacobs knew he was not listening like he had been before.

It had been some time since they had last discussed his marriage and, to Jacob's experienced eye, \"Morrison did not seem to wish to take it any further.\n\n\"I appreciate your help, Secretary Jacobs,\" The President said, leaving the topic of his thanks deliberately vague.

Now, however, it was time to focus on the work.\n\n\"The opportunity to help save the URI and so many people's hard work is more than enough thanks, Mr. President,\" She replied.

Going forward, it'll be my turn to try to keep the URI together.\"\n\n\"I hope you have better luck than I did.

Per usual, he seemed tired and energized all at once, powered by whatever caffeine and personal determination was keeping him from falling asleep. Wired or prepared, Chep was prepared to accept whatever McCarthy he was getting. He needed good news from the Secretary of Agriculture, in whatever form it might come.\n\nMcCarthy leaned forward and pulled out his briefcase, fiddling with it as he spoke. \"You remember our conversation, a few weeks ago? Well, I had an idea about it. Called up an advertising agency, and got these printed.\"\n\nMcCarthy's briefcase opened, and he pulled something out of it, slapping it on Chep's desk. Pamphlets. Colorful pamphlets, with graphs and plans, explaining URI benefits to rural communities.\n\nChep picked up one design and rifled through it, admiring all the graphics and arguments. \"It's nice, McCarthy - punchy, clean, modern. This is good work.\" Chep got up, and began to move around the office. \"Now, the unpleasant part. I need you to know on the onset that this is your department's work. You'll have to sort out the distribution on these.\"\n\nMcCarthy grimaced. \"I understand. I have a lot on my plate, what with the rural pushback, but I can get this through.\"\n\nHe smiled faintly, which made him look even smaller."

It was a never ending cycle, and Chep was burning out.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a voice from the other end of the hallway. An unassuming man was running towards him. McCarthy, he noticed. Seemed he'd had a meeting here as well.\n\n\"Mr. President, good to see you!\" The secretary shouted, his voice just a little out of breath. As he got closer, he slowed to a walk, and his voice quieted. \"I have some good news for you, if you'd like it.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding?\" Chep said, frustrated. \"I'll take any good signs I can get. McCarthy, spit it out!\"\n\nMcCarthy quickly began speaking. \"Well, recruitment in the Department of Agriculture has risen. We're getting a lot of recruits from rural areas—the same regions where the URI backlash began. Given the Department's current recruitment drive, we can assume they have read the pamphlets.\"\n\n\"And they must like what they're hearing. Good job, Gene!\" Chep patted McCarthy on the back, nearly knocking him over. \"Getting the farmers on our side - that's one step closer to shutting down this whole backlash. Glad I ran into you.\"\n\nWith a smile on his face, Chep turned towards the double doors. As he left, he looked back at McCarthy, as he ruffled through his notes and walked into his next meeting."

Environmentalism, clean government... common sense ideas, in my view. Somehow, they've started circling with the urban youth. I keep getting letters from them.

The press is working to ruin me like there's no tomorrow, and that aside, what are you asking of me, exactly?\" Chep felt a slight grin hug his face and leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"Nothing much, Reuther, just a hand in mobilizing support for the URI- I know I'm not Hart, but we've still got an obligation to work together on these things, especially when they're as important as this.\"\n\nToo true, Chep thought. So far as he'd seen, the two were practically symbiotic in their work routine, and not in such a way that Morrison could easily fill that gap. A sigh emanated from the phone.\n\n\"Alright, Chep, where do you need me?\"\n\n\"I just need you to come to Washington, we can hash things out there.

I haven't exactly warmed up to flying in 15 minutes- you seem a bit off, are you feeling alright?\" Morrison let out a sigh and slid down his chair, losing his composed, harrowed look.\n\n\"No, Reuther, I'm really not. I'm sorry to drop this on you but I've been through more theatricals than governing lately, and I'm only getting more sick of both, and even being around that damned Boeing...\" Reuther nodded empathetically, with more than a touch of enthusiasm.\n\n\"I know all too well- if you don't mind me telling the truth, my flight was downright dreadful. Nothing particularly bad about it, I've just always had a fear of flying, you know. Bad feelings from those.\" Reuther said, watching as Morrison began to nod, still staring straight forward, though seeming more lively now.\n\n\"You and me both, Reuther, that's what I like best about you- you always seem to be real spooked of the same stuff I am.\" Chep smiled, glancing over to Reuther.\n\n\"Sure, Chep, but that's the difference between you and me both- you know how to hide what you get spooked of.

Anyways, I can ask them and see if I can pull out some carrots for them, but it'll be a struggle.\"\n\nMorrison nodded, processing the information.\n\n\"And how about those union boys? How far can they go with this?\" Chep asked, a new wave of concern sitting with him.

Scenes like this are unfolding across the nation, and it can heard from almost any union leader today; the URI stays, or the workers leave.

Reuther had outdone himself. Dialing up the phone on his desk, Chep listened to the ringtone for a moment before Reuther picked up, and after a moment of exchanging pleasantries, the pair chuckled to each other.\n\n\"Reuther, I have to say, I'm impressed. I hope this wasn't too costly, was it?\" Morrison asked, still wondering how so many could be mobilized in such short time- if only he could mobilize these numbers come next primaries.\n\n\"No, Chep, but don't expect this kind of treatment again anytime soon. At this rate we'll be on every paper in America, and I suppose that's the best it can get for this movement- it'll only get less coverage from here, you know.\" Reuther warned. Morrison let out a sigh.\n\n\"I know, Reuther, but if nothing else sways the balance, this will. Thank you for that.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. President.

As the slight din of conversation began to pick up around them, and the pair received their dinner for the evening, they began to finally broach the topic of why they were there that night.\n\n\"Walter, I have to say, you've impressed me.\" Morrison said with a smile while picking at his dinner. \"I'd expected nothing more than a shot at the support of the union boys, but this...\"\n\n\"I know, to be perfectly honest I'm a little shocked I managed it myself,\" Reuther stated, cutting through his steak with a slight tinge of anxiety. \"But I'd say it's a victory on my end, too- just because we've got the Civil Rights movement marching for the URI, we've already opened ourselves up to a new ally, and this kind of clout doesn't come out of nowhere- I've got to thank you for at least part of this, Chep.\"\n\nMorrison let his utensils rest against the plate, and seemed lost in thought for a moment, before finally speaking.\n\n\"Walter, it's not every day that you can find an ally like you folks and the UAW.

I swear, these people you have, they swarm around like gnats getting in the way but never helping.\" She waved imaginary insects out of her face. \"The papers loved it. Audiences loved it.

Though I understand your discretion, I wish you had been able to meet Hart. I am sure the two of you would have gotten along.\n\nThis is not the subject to which I am writing. Rather, my concern - and my impetus - lies with the gap he has left behind. My fellow cabinet members and I have spent the last few months in a state of perpetual crisis. Without Hart's oratory skills and congressional authority, we have been left to rely on Chep Morrison, who lacks the ability or personal strength to properly navigate this political system.\n\nWithout his defence, Congress has come to pick apart the Urban Renewal Initiative. Conservative and rural legislators have begun fighting against the core of the program, picking apart at its protections, hoping to break apart its core administration. They lampoon it as an expensive waste, one which does not protect their constituencies.\n\nI will cut straight to my point. Mr. Rustin, I need your help. Without proper defence, the URI - and all the good it has done for the underprivileged of America - might be destroyed. Whenever you might be visit Washington, I ask that you might visit me in person. Your insight would be valuable, even necessary, in this moment of crisis."

Set at a mediocre diner in the heart of Washington, Jacobs and Rustin had exchanged many pleasantries, and required no more from each other. This was less than a conversation. This was a negotiation, or perhaps a desperate plea.\n\n\"You know I wouldn't ask for this if it wasn't important.\" Jacobs responded, still staring into her coffee. \"We need to find support in minority communities if we have even a chance of getting the URI through without some cuts. If you don't help now, it might destroy everything that we have organized.\"\n\n\"That you have organized,\" quipped Rustin. \"I'm not saying that it's not worth saving. But you're not the problem here - it's Chep. In my days with Reverend King, I saw Morrison's Louisiana, and it was no different than Wallace's Alabama or Faubus' Arkansas. That man was committed, seriously committed, to the institution of segregation - and now, he was looking for a bailout from the black community?\"\n\n\"President Morrison isn't asking for your help, Rustin.

Sure, he'd helped out Hart with some useful reforms in the cities - but this man was a southern governor during the height of segregation. When Chep invited Rustin to meet with him and Jacobs, Rustin tried to come in with a good outlook - a few friends had described Chep as a reformer, after all, and he certainly soaked up the black vote during his time in New Orleans.\n\nBut so far, the verdict remained decidedly negative.\n\n\"The URI has touched a lot of urban minority communities.\" Chep continued. \"Hell, we saved a lot of communities that even FDR wouldn't touch. Black folks got a lot of wins, a lot of wins.\" Chep chuckled to himself for a moment. \"Now, we're hoping to flip the tables, so to speak. We need help from folks like you—men who can organize the minorities of America to fight for their country. That sound good?\"\n\nChep burst out his widest smile. Rustin took some care in his response. \"What makes you certain I'm going to say yes?\"\n\nChep blurted out a response with a mix of confusion and indignation. \"Should I be thinking otherwise?\"\n\nRustin turned to his friend Jane Jacobs, who appeared to be cringing in her seat. \"I think... perhaps this matter is best handled between the two of us.\""

Jacobs typically remained composed in her time in government, but she had spent more time than she wished to admit fretting over Rustin's response. She had stuck her neck out trying to get him on her side - him saying no would be devastating, and he had so many reasons to decline. By the time it arrived, she barely could find the patience to grab her penknife before slicing it over.\n\nShe looked it over. A quick scan found the key word - \"help\". She could finally breathe.\n\nYet after a closer reading, it was remarkable just how much he was promising. This was more than just some advisory meetings - rather, it was a plan to create a real campaign of support for the URI, raised from urban black activists. Clearly, Rustin believed the black community agreed with his views on this issue. It wasn't just a favor. This was a major show of confidence from one of the largest civil rights leaders in America.\n\nJacobs chuckled at the last line - \"Just as long as I never have to speak to your boss again.\"\n\nWith a gentle touch, she placed the letter back in its envelope, filed it in her desk, and pulled out a pen.

Tomorrow, she would try to paper this over, move on to the next plan. But first, she'd have to write a response.\n\nRustin's letter was a pointed, simple refusal. Rustin reiterated a few of his basic criticism of the URI, noted his previous recommendations, and stated that, in his view, they had come true. The URI was not properly protecting communities of color, in his mind. It was papering over them.\n\nIt shouldn't have bothered her so much. Hart had never kept close with the civil rights movement. It wasn't a reflection on her, or her work, or their connection. Yet it stung all the same. She had been fighting for these issues, trying her damnest to make sure the URI was good for everyone. Even for all of Hart's failings, had she not done enough?\n\nFinally, she got up. She couldn't find it in her for a response - she had to go home someday. Maybe tomorrow, when she had some more energy, she would be able to accept his criticisms and move on. Rustin could wait another day.\n\nAs she left, she noticed the photo of her and Hart, framed on her desk. Just one more movement that was leaving Hart behind, she thought to herself.

Organized by Rustin, the \"Marches for a Safer City\" kept the world watching the urban streets.\n\nTheir marches were lit by bright new lampposts, paid for with URI funds. Their paths were built to highlight the new housing developments, where lower-income families could find a home. Their marchers walked under new elevated trains which connected their neighborhoods, and over repaved streets that kept them safe. Their paths were a tour through the new American city, one designed for the camera crews that followed their every move.\n\nThrough televisions across America, people far from city life watched. For those months, every American saw what Hart's initiative had created - and all the people it had helped."

It was the effective privatization of the URI's public housing programs, capable of dealing a massive blow to the entire program.\n\n\"If this passes, Mr. Morrison, the administration is back to square one on housing,\" Jacobs warned, \"Once investors get their hands on this and turn it into amarket we'll see marked-up costs and any pretense of affordability for all abandoned. America's poor and vulnerable squeezed out of their first homes they've ever had...\" Jacobs continued laying out the crisis ahead but Chep had drifted away.\n\nHe was no pessimist, having gotten where he was with a boot-strapping positive attitude but even he was daunted by the mountains ahead. He knew he had to go lobby senators, congressmen, appear on television, radio, heck the street corner if that was what it took to keep Hart's legacy alive. The image of doors slamming in his face, allies walking away, and the conservative sharks circling clouded his mind.\n\nSomething small and rotten inside of him resisted, arguing that resisting the attacks on the URI was pointless and why even make the effort? Even as he left the Oval Office, Chep, knowing better, listened a bit too much to that little voice. It had been correct more often than not recently, he reasoned.

Well, Chep thought to himself, if he was lucky and the Senate still had some sense he still could veto the bill.\n\n\"Mr. President. I'm sorry, sir, but the bill passed with a super-majority. I tried to get some of the friendlier senators on board, but they would barely hear me out, let alone switch their votes.\" Bayh sounded deeply apologetic, well aware of what this meant to Morrison. The veto option, the last chance, was gone.\n\nChep squeezed his eyes close. Damn. Damn. Damn. Another failure, another slap in the face from a Senate eager to tear everything he and so many others had worked for to pieces. Sitting in the Oval Office, phone in hand, he suddenly felt the loneliest he ever had in his life. He hung up after murmuring a goodbye to Bayh.\n\nHe had saved the Cabinet, at least he had that, the President thought, as a headache came on. Sure, the URI was being ripped apart, but the ship of state was steady asides from that. What could any other President have done? Could Philip Hart have charmed an austerity-mad Senate from hacking his ambitions down to size? Chep had certainly given it his all, hadn't he?

The market has a natural role to play, but not an exclusive one. For all Americans to have housing, a governmental option is necessary and I view these programs as foundational to my predecessor, President Hart's legacy. With that said, I veto this legislation.\"\n\nIt was a start at least, as he looked it over. He had speechwriters to punch it up but still wanted to revel in this victory a bit longer, to see it written out before him. It had probably been back in New Orleans the last time he had savored a triumph like this.\n\nOf course it was still concerning that the bill had passed at all and come close to the margin for victory and overcoming his veto. He could not let his guard down and would have to keep lobbying against these bills, regardless of the conservative opposition, if he wanted to keep the URI alive.\n\nIt was good to have a victory under the Morrison Administration's belt, he thought, as he reached for his phone. It would shake the confidence of the heretofore cocky conservatives, confident that the deficit panic would push marginal senators towards repealing the URI piece by piece. Now, maybe, hopefully, the momentum and shifted and his calls would fall on more receptive ears."

The Senate had against all predictions and odds, indeed seen sense.\n\n\"Bayh, my apologies. That is wonderful news indeed. Seems like Laxalt and his crowd had more bark than bite. We need to stay vigilant though, one victory doesn't end a war like this but its certainly good for our spirits.\" He hung up the phone and sat back.

These weren't the pencil-pushing bureaucrats the right rhetorically targeted but instead those who maintained and expanded America's infrastructure, much grown after President Hart's tenure. With these workers gone, America's transportation arteries would begin to atrophy.\n\nChep nearly found it funny, until Bayh walked him through the Senate's disposition. The bill could still very well pass with a veto-proof majority, which wiped any hint of mirth from his face. He still had a job to do and a battle to fight.\n\nThere were marginal senators, one who would appreciate the Administration directing favors their way, or who'd appreciate assistace during campaign season. The activists could also be useful if deployed properly. And of course, these workers themselves had every incentive to fight for their livelihoods, as did every American who used America's roads or rails or waterways.\n\n\"Thank you, Vice President Bayh,\" He replied, coming out of his ponderimg, \"I'll start working my way down this list and you do the same.

Then the conservatives would have to water their bill down and pass it through the Senate again and if they'd lacked the votes he could have sent it right back to them again. But that hadn't happened. Instead, a supermajority of the Senate had passed the America's Choice Act despite his administration and its allies' lobbying.\n\nNow, tens of thousands of Americans would wake up tomorrow with a cloud over them, never knowing when their job would vanish and their lives be uprooted forever. It hardly bore thinking about, but in this moment of absolute defeat, all Chep could think of was everyone he and the Senate had failed.\n\nHe had rarely felt quite so alone as he did now. There was nothing that Bayh could say at this point, his touch with the Senate had been insufficient and it was now a matter of waiting for the next blow to fall. Nor could he stand seeing Jacobs. She would be even more acutely aware of this bill's fallout and seeing the disappointment in her eyes would be intolerable.\n\nSighing deeply, he reached for the phone.

They had not seen eye to eye but Chep felt a duty to his predecessor's programs built on deep respect for the man. It seemed that some of that residual goodwill remained in the Senate, at least for now. He had his hand back on the ship's tiller, feeling back in control for the first time in a while. His administration had been buffeted and thrown about the storms of history and politics but now they semed to be on a stabler course.\n\nThe conservatives would be back, naturally, with another attack on the URI, on what remained of Philip Hart's ideas for America. Chep Morrison would be waiting for them with every senator, representative, activist and citizen that he could mobilize. The bill had still passed and had a few minds been shifted a devastating blow could well have been dealt to the URI.

Homes would be kept and a mini-tidal wave of human misery had been averted. It hadn't been easy fighting off the privatization scheme, requiring all the arm-twisting, speech-making and horse-trading that he had in him. It had stretched his political abilities and endurance to the breaking point in a stretch of campaigning he could only compare as similar to the most frenetic parts of presidential campaigns.\n\nIt had all been worth it though. Even if he knew the conservatives and deficit hawks in Congress would be back again with another attack on the URI when they had regrouped. He would be ready and waiting.

The legislation, called the Worker's Welfare Act, at first appeared like a very mixed bag. It did not repeal any of the URI's new welfare provisions per se, instead it simply bound up the program in voluminous red tape.\n\nIn order to access their benefits, workers would have to show proof that they were employed, not using drugs, that their children were in school, that they were married and on and on and on. Each individual restriction seemed reasonable on its face, but as the pages turned concern mounted within Chep. String enough requirements together, enough demands for proof and paperwork and the number of people eligible for the programs would shrink accordingly.\n\nAnother part of him, less charitable, rejoiced at these restrictions. Why should public funds go to criminals on drugs who wanted their addictions paid for by John Q. Taxpayer? Shouldn't the government be encouraging marriage, work and sobriety? Yet he knew deep down that that was not the intent behind the bill. Rather than repeal this section of the URI, its critics instead would rope it off with red tape, its programs a tantalizing enticement to the many Americans who needed who, unfortunately, would never be able to see the program's fruits.\n\nDisgust rising in him, he pushed the bill away from him. Another attack on the URI was in progress and he would have to be ready to bat it away. Hopefully the senators would see the downsides of the law, and if they did not, he would hopefully at least retain the ability to veto the bill."

 chep.billpass.4.t: "The Silver Lining"
 chep.billpass.4.desc: "A wry smile appeared on President Chep Morrison's voice when he heard the news from the Senate that the Worker's Welfare Act had passed. He had expected that outcome given the bee in the Senate's bonnet regarding the deficit and spending. His mouth hardened somewhat when the margin was announced. A Supermajority. The Senate had taken it out of his hands and now he could not even veto it if he were so inclined.\n\nMaybe it was for the best, he thought. Chep had always been skeptical of unrestricted welfare. He suspected people had a greater capacity for graft and laziness than some believed. He certainly would not have liked the idea of some bum using his hard-earned money to relax and smoke a joint instead of working. Ultimately, he could not truly disagree with the Senate's decision, even if it stung that the ability to veto it had been taken away from him.\n\nIf the URI was going to survive, he reasoned, the most controversial, flawed parts of it would have to go. The Senate had really done him a favor by picking off this part of it. Better that the unrestricted welfare of it be repealed than the transportation provisions, for example. With each new justification, Chep's anxiety eased somewhat. This wasn't his fault, and it might even be a good thing.\n\nPhilip couldn't blame him for this, the Senate had taken it out of his hand. And maybe even he would admit that that element of the URI had been flawed. It did not really matter at this point, the Senate had made clear that it did not particularly value Hart's legacy or Chep's objections when it had spending to cut and programs to wind down. He had tried his best. Chep kept repeating that to himself as the sun began to set and the Oval Office darkened."

 chep.billveto.4.t: "The Stroke of the Pen"
 chep.billveto.4.desc: "Looking at the Worker's Welfare Act before him, Chep hesitated. He had mixed feelings about the bill, the Devil's Advocate within him saying that, out of all the anti-URI bills this was the most reasonable. Maybe it would be better to give the conservatives a victory and satiate them rather than continue to try to hold back the tide.\n\nThen he thought beyond that. He imagined everyone who relied on the URI's programs to pay their rent, to feed their children and to live lives unburdened by crippling poverty. Some would manage to navigate the new requirements for aid under the URI, but far, far too many would fail to do so and lose the lifeline they so desperately needed. He could still prevent that from happening, and he reached for his pen. He had seen some positives within this bill but now at the moment of truth he knew what he had to do.\n\n\"I will be vetoing the Worker's Welfare Act. I believe that this is an attempt to de-facto repeal provisions of the Urban Renewal Initiative through the deployment of bureaucratic red tape and labyrinthine procedures. If the Senate takes issue with a program, they should be honest and openly repeal it, not hide behind weasel words and regulations and deceive the American people.\"\n\nHe smiled as he read over the veto message. He had often felt powerless in the Oval Office but in this moment, wielding the veto power, he felt like a proper executive. This was what the President was supposed to do: wield his powers to defend the vulnerable and marginalized from a penny-pinching legislature. Another plank of the URI would survive, at least until the Senate regrouped and tried again."

I doubt we'll be seeing it again.\"\n\n\"This is wonderful,\" Jacobs said, clapping her hands happily. She had expected the worst from the Senate but it seemed that the URI's enemies had dropped the ball very badly indeed. The URI's welfare provisions would survive to another day.\n\nAlone amid the celebration, Chep Morrison worried. He knew many Americans were perfectly open to restrictions upon access to welfare. Plenty of hardworking citizens did not like the idea of public funds going to anyone who could fill out a form. He was one of them. With the mood of the country, it did not seem like the best move to be celebrating this victory when it could so easily backfire. Jacobs raised a quizzical eyebrow at him, prompting him for an explanation for his silence.\n\n\"I just worry the conservatives will hang any welfare fraud around our necks,\" He explained, \"This bill has problems, but it's trying to deal with serious issues...\" He trailed off.\n\n\"I see your point, Mr. Morrison,\" Bayh said, \"But these provisions of the URI are popular, and if we want them to work properly then we can't have all these conditions and restrictions placed on them.\"\n\nJacobs nodded, adding, \"When the storm passes, Mr. President, and the conservatives' energy fades, this program will stand as a keystone of the URI.

He'd been briefed on it a few minutes earlier, but Chep thought he'd take a moment to look through it himself.\n\nThe proposed bill was weak, even by the standards of the anti-URI movement. Devoid of any of the clever workarounds in previous bills, the Transportation Assessment Act was a naked set of cuts to the precautions and regulations that Hart had established during the Oil Crisis. With the energy crisis \"over\", supposedly, there was no need for these \"frivolous\" protections.\n\nChep knew it wasn't an attack on Hart, or Jacobs, or even himself. The URI was their target - these men had a host of incentives, ideological, economic, and careerist, a messy entanglement of beliefs and motives which Chep had long given up analyzing. Yet he couldn't help but see it as low. No matter what they screamed on the television, these men had to understand the reason that energy precautions were vital - they had seen the oil crisis play out all across the globe. Even after watching others fall, they were still happy to hack at the ropes beneath their feet.\n\nChep sighed. He was just one man.

The final systems of the URI, the emergency energy precautions, had been left in tatters.\n\nIn the wake of the law passing, Birch Bayh attempted to convince Chep that the government could continue—that there were answers, bodies to save from this fire. But Chep couldn't believe it, even consider it. All Chep could think of were the people he had failed, the nation that he had failed, and the predecessor he had failed. If another energy crisis came, Americans would suffer the harsh colds and rusting cars that Hart had fought so hard to move past.\n\nChep needed time for himself, he resolved.

Perhaps it was a win too small—after all, Chep had still been forced to use his veto. But the Transportation Assessment Act was a dead bill. The emergency precautions which the Hart administration built would last a while longer.\n\nIn the days afterward, Chep thought long and hard about the few senators who had gotten off the URI bandwagon to abstain from the Transportation Assessment Act. Perhaps even some of the anti-URi crowd understood, deep in their hearts, the misery which the energy crisis inflicted across America. They must have understood that America deserved to never face such a horror again.\n\nWhatever they felt, it was a victory.

America is telling us they have faith in us again, faith in Hart. Think of the things we could be doing with this kind of headway!\"\n\nChep did consider it, but not for long. \"I appreciate the attitude, but I got to be honest. I just can't keep staying up like this. I'm a spent man, Bayh—at least for now. You're gonna need to give me some time.\"\n\nThe two said their goodbyes, and Chep got up from his seat.

It was devouring his soul, he was sure of that.\n\n\"Sir?\" Said a voice from nearby. Chep turned to see the lanky figure of his press office aide Gary Moriarty.

The \"Federal Finance Act\" would impose new restrictions on URI recipient cities, require localities receiving federal aid and grant programs to have balanced budgets, require cities to drop from programs such as the URI if they failed to meet certain federal requirements...\n\nThe President's face went pale. What he was reading was nothing less than an attempt to destroy URI funding across the board. The conservatives had determined that Chep's efforts to raise popular support for the URI had failed and were throwing aside all pretensions of gradual, respectful reform. They knew the ghost of Philip Hart would not rise from the dead to stop them.\n\n\"Do you want, um, to put together a press conference to protest this, sir?

Any moment, the bill would be passing with overwhelming margins. It would devastate the URI's funding. He continued watching as a man passed Cronkite a paper. The reporter grabbed it, adjusted his glasses, and then began mouthing its contents. Chep unmuted the television.\n\n\"—on the Hill. We're receiving word that the caucus is now introducing a second bill and, bypassing the usual legislative process, is expected to vote on it tonight.

He could call what few staffers he had left to get him in touch with leadership. He could even get the Secret Service to drive him to the Capitol right now to make desperate pleas to individual members, throwing himself pathetically at the mercy of legislators. But Chep Morrison found that his body could not move. The conservatives wouldn't be pulling this sudden power play if they didn't already have the votes.

All in the West Wing was silent. All except his Secret Security detail had gone home. Zsa Zsa wasn't coming down to save him.\n\nShaking, Chep Morrison rose from the couch where he had been sitting. He hobbled across the enormous circular carpet of the Oval Office and sat himself behind the Resolute Desk. He stared at the few knick-knacks he'd decorated the surface with—a baseball, a snow globe of New Orleans, a photo of him and Philip Hart. He grabbed the last object and put it gingerly in the desk drawer.\n\nThe Urban Renewal Initiative was gone. Most of what he and Hart had worked for was gone. Every struggle that he and the cabinet had gone through, every sacrifice that they had made had been for nothing. Two entire administrations had been disintegrated in the course of a single evening.\n\nChep set his head on the desk. Perhaps, he forced himself to think, there was still some way to salvage this situation. He just needed a moment's rest to clear his head.

He hoped that next year, people would realise the selfish, treacherous behaviour of the conservatives and vote them out, securing Philip and Chep's legacies.\n\nOf course, he decided to distract himself from the failures of his term as President - attending parties and spending time with Zsa Zsa, but his mind always wandered back to the damage done to the URI. He often thought about who was at fault for it, blaming the conservatives, the cabinet (particularly Secretary Jane Jacobs) and the feckless voters and activists who had failed to demand from the conservatives the bill's preservation."

Hart's Presidency saved it from demolition and the neighbourhood was revitalised by the development schemes his administration created. This was why after her retirement as Housing, Education, and Welfare Secretary, Jane Jacobs decided to return and spend time with the people she had fought for.\n\nSure enough, The Village was delighted to host her, and Jane Jacobs got to experience genuine gratitude for the first time in a long while after the Urban Renewal Initiative was cut to the bone in Congress. A reporter from the local newspaper asked her, \"Mrs. Jacobs, would you say that you are happy with the work that you have completed under Presidents Hart and Morrison?\" Jane responded, a forced smile on her face with, \"Yes, absolutely.\" \"Do you intend to do more work on urban issues in the future?\" \"I may well end up doing so, but right now I need to spend some time at home to remind myself of what I was working for in Congress.\"\n\nAs she settled back into her life prior to being in the presidential cabinet, she could clearly see that her work had affected everyone in The Village's lives for the better. However, she was still bitterly regretful of the Administration's failures, blaming President Chep Morrison for it mostly but also questioning her own skills when it came to the preservation of the Urban Renewal Initiative."

After their string of legislative losses in Washington, leaving the URI battered and bloody, they had come to Chep's hometown to get their minds off of the defeats. Thus far, they had had little success.\n\nWandering the city, Chep blathered about every street and store and occasionally stopped to chat with friendly pedestrians. The question of the URI loomed: Had it survived, would New Orleans be different? Better? Safer? The questions went on and neither man wanted  to address them. Coming to some invisible line between two neighborhoods, Chep halted and looked around.\n\n\"This is a bad part of town, Bayh. I think we should turn around.\" Bayh's eyebrows furrowed. It didn't look like a bad area, but then a passing family greeted Morrison.\n\n\"Mr. Morrison,\" The father said, beaming, \"I doubt you remember me, but we met at a campaign event back in '54. Frank Richmond. I just wanted to thank you for all the fighting you've been doing for those of us here. I've lived in this neighborhood for decades but it was only when you and Philip Hart were in the White House that things got better.\" Chep graciously thanked the man, greeted his children and continued his walk with Bayh.\n\nHe had a new spring in his step, the Vice President noticed. Perhaps meeting supporters from happier times had dredged up fond memories when his only concern was the city of New Orleans. Maybe meeting those who had been helped by his seemingly futile battle had given all of his struggles and suffering of late meaning. Whatever it was, Bayh was content not to pry."

It is an astounding proposal, having known that the OFN and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere have come to conflict many times over the past decade, and it is at this point that we should consider the limits of our relationship with the United States.\n\nWhat the Americans want in return for such a seemingly-generous deal is unclear. I, however, will venture to give an educated guess. the Americans want their ports in California to return to their fold, reasoning that if the Empire could bask in the restoration of trade relations, they should equally be rewarded by the return of American territory.\n\nIn light of this information, I place myself at the service of the Cabinet yet again, and trust in the colleagues to make the right decision regarding all of this.\n\nSigned, Takeuchi Ryuji"
