 POLITICS_TROFIM_LYSENKO_DESC: "トロフィム・ルイセンコはかつてソ連から社会主義科学の金の卵としてもてはやされた。ブルジョワ機関が宣伝する反動的な「教育」を退けんとする謙虚なプロレタリア科学者がついに現れたのだ！マルクスの原理が人間社会のみならず地球の果実にも適用されることを証明したその人である！彼の理論はソビエト連邦を世界的な農業大国へと変貌させるだろう！ダーウィン主義は過去であり、ルイセンコ主義こそが未来なのだ！\n\n少なくとも、彼はそう約束した。\n\n彼の成果は遥かに期待外れだったが、都合の良い戦争の到来により、深刻な状況に直面することはなかった。ルイセンコ及び忠実な科学者の一団は、ソ連の前線が崩壊するとともに第22NKVD自動車化歩兵師団によって東へと避難し、彼の「重要な研究」がファシストの手に渡るのを防いだ。ソ連が崩壊すると、ルイセンコは出資者を失い、第22師団は命令を受けられなくなったため、その二者間で同盟が結ばれた。彼はたとえ連邦が国家としてまとまった存在でなくとも、連邦のために自らの研究を続ける必要があると考え、新たな研究施設が必要だと第22師団の指揮官を揺さぶった。西ロシア革命戦線においての活動後（最終的に離脱）、廃墟と化した工業都市マグニトゴルスクに安息の地を見つけ、かつて見捨てられた「黒い山」を研究、延いては科学革新の拠点にしたのである。\n\nしかしルイセンコは擬似ラマルク的進化論を捨て去ることはなく、その正しさの証明のために時間と資源を注ぎ込み続けていた。そして、連邦が危機に瀕している今、彼の理論が人間にも当てはまると証明することは、軍事的なメリットにもつながるかもしれない……"
 POLITICS_STEPAN_BUNKOV_DESC: "NKVD第22機械化師団の唯一無二の指揮官であるステパン・ミハイロヴィチ・ブニコフはソビエトの祖国に、ドイツの戦車がそれを破滅に導いた後でさえも忠実に仕えた。彼とルイセンコとの運命がどう交差したかは定かではないが、同志ブニコフはモスクワが陥落する直前にクレムリンより、ロシアの中心部が侵略者に屈したのちも科学技術関連の知識人が国家の利益のために働くことができるようウラル山脈の麓へと避難させる任務を受けたと一般には信じられている。亡命の途上で全ての自称ソ連の後継者から必要とされなかったルイセンコは、亡命科学者の軍閥を創設してその支配を固め、NKVD師団を抑圧とテロルのための武器として利用した。\n\nマグニトゴルスクに到着して以来、ブニコフはルイセンコの監視のもとで数々の残虐行為に手を染め、ルイセンコの判断を自ら信じた。しかし、ルイセンコの実験が残虐で正気を疑うようなものになってくると、ブニコフはマグニトゴルスクのエリート科学者に対して疑問を抱き反対し始め、ルイセンコは彼をソビエトのやり方を取り戻すための足手まといになると考え始めた。だがブニコフは先手に動き、ルイセンコをその地位から追い払った。短い統治の間にルイセンコ主義者の悪夢を終わらせ、旧ソビエトの学会を再構築する試みを行い始め、ルイセンコの下に蔓延した無秩序に終止符を打った。しかし、彼がこの国を強く支配している以上、反体制派を従わせるために残忍な手段を取ることも可能だと考えても、非難される筋合いはないだろう。"

Every time we give Dirlewanger an inch, he takes a mile.

 MGN.51.t: "Communiqué 07.j"
 MGN.51.d: "Investigation of Magnitogorsk armory storage facilities, and subsequent testing of equipment discovered within, has indicated that weapons stored within protected locations (Depots, Armories, Caches) prior to the collapse of the USSR remain in working condition for the most part. Out of 320 recovered Mosin-Nagant 91/30 rifles (See weapon profile summary 1-c), 278 were still usable and the remainder require only minor maintenance to be restored. Though not as well preserved, ammunition within the armory still remained usable, with a survey estimating that of the 4,500 7.62x54mmR rounds recovered, 3,200 are still usable.\n\nOperating under the assumption that the conditions of the Magnitogorsk arsenal are similar to those of other Soviet era weapons caches, it is probable that there are large numbers of functional military-grade weapons and support equipment unaccounted for within our territory. The location and retrieval of these items has been made a class b priority (see priority ranking document) and teams have been dispatched to likely locations (see accompanying map below) to search for the depots. Soviet records on file, especially document 45380 (report on military installations in the Southern Urals region) and the 1938 army census have been used as the primary information sources to determine probable caches, though it it is important to note the dated nature of these sources (see addendum 1)."

Several hundred guns and a few thousand rounds of ammunition have been recovered (refer to attached unit reports at the end of this document for exact numbers and specifications) and are being sent to Magnitogorsk to be issued to the army. The primary causes of the low returns are: weather damage in exposed caches, and stolen supplies that were probably taken shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union (for list and map of breached military locations please see the attached report). Comrade Lysenko has scheduled a meeting with the officers responsible for the searches to thank them for their efforts, and has ordered a review of the predictive processes that overestimated the amount of recoverable supplies (see predictive algorithm procedures summary). The weapons that have been recovered will prove useful in keeping our field operatives well equipped in the event of an unanticipated production delay."

 MGN.54.d: "Black Mountain, the pseudo-communist pseudo-scientific state led by Trofim Lysenko has approached us. Sending a heavily armed ambassadorship in starched uniforms, they declared themselves the rightful successor to the Soviet Union's science program, a tenuous link seemingly fueled entirely by the madness of a man who does not believe the Union ever fell, and demanded that we give them a tithe of men, women and children. After inquiring why, they stated that the people would be serving the Soviet Union, their rightful government, in advancing the cause of \"socialist workers everywhere, by ensuring the continued advancement of Soviet science and advancement for use against the great enemy in Germany\". When further pressed to elaborate on what that actually meant, the soldiers, seemingly members of the NKVD, admitted this meant that they would be participating in 'scientific experiments' in order to make them stronger. To better fight the Germans.\n\nWhile these demands are patently ridiculous, and while any sane leader would refuse this outright, the soldiers of 'Comrade' Lysenko seem quite formidable. Still polishing the buttons on their khaki uniforms twenty years after the last order was given to do so.\n\nWe could refuse, should we choose, but are the lives of a few peasants truly worth such conflict?"

This 'tributary' system (see attachment pg.1-8 for supplementary and historical information) would greatly ease Subject Extraction efforts and allow us to maintain subject flow easier, thereby streamlining our experiments and increasing our knowledge on the 'Lysenkoist' science system mandated by the Supreme Soviet (see Soviet Science Directive 14.A on the use of technology against the German Reich by Comrade Bukharin in archives for additional explanation). (see Science compendium for supplementary information)\nHowever, after dispatching an ambassador to a neighboring autonomous Soviet republic, we received a written response and an envoy returning with a noted lack of subjects.

They have been shot already of course, though their plans were extensive and seemed too ambitious for three guards.

Stepan Bunkov, Commanding Officer of the 22nd, ordered Comrade Lysenko to be seated and for his attendees to be thrown in shackles, the Comrade's protests were met with enforcement of Bunkov's orders by the agents. Comrade-Lieutenant-General Bunkov read out a list of accusations against Comrade Lysenko, including numerous counts of crimes against humanity and treason against the long-dead Soviet Union. In addition he listed the demands of the NKVD in order to maintain a status-quo, nigh unmeetable terms that effectively neutered Comrade Lysenko's ability to perform research or command anyone outside of his close circle. Comrade-Lieutenant-General Bunkov lifted his eyes from the paper before him and regarded the intense, hateful stare of Comrade Lysenko. Comrade Lysenko had mere moments to defuse this situation."

The news of Comrade Lysenko's arrest was made public, the NKVD had valiantly removed the despot from power at great risk to their own lives, but his trial was a serious matter, the people were assured, and there could be no mistakes in gathering all the evidence. The NKVD junta had no second thoughts over Comrade Lysenko's fate, they didn't care for a beaten-out confession or to torture the creature, no matter how justified it would be. No, the NKVD simply wanted the monster gone and dead in a ditch, the thousands dead at his twisted hands would not care for any false mimicking of a trial. Indeed, his execution would be a just and noble act, perhaps the first the NKVD would perform in decades. With a brief discussion, ultimate responsibility for the execution was passed to Comrade-Commissar Smorodinskii, who gathered a firing squad within the hour.\n\nTrofim Lysenko was dragged into the cold, silent prison courtyard. He mumbled incessantly into the sack over his head, a request from the firing team who feared the deranged eyes of the monster. With little ceremony, the presiding officer quickly rattled off the crimes of Trofim Lysenko, and the punishment meted out by the Transitionary Council. When the officer finished he nodded to the five men gathered before him and granted them permission to fire. The Madman of Magnitogorsk, Trofim Lysenko, howled at hearing his fate but was brought silent as his body was rattled with five precise shots from the firing squad. One of the shooters spat in the direction of the limp corpse that hung from its post, a final farewell to the lunatic that had done so much harm to all those he encountered."

 MGN.102.t: "Armament Planning"
 MGN.102.desc: "One of the biggest weaknesses that our army has is a lack of equipment and ammunition to fight the Ural League and Orenburg Commune. This is also coupled with the fact we even have to ask the bandits of Dirlewanger's Brigade for help. That fact has been an utter embarrassment for the proud scientist. With war coming ahead, NKVD commanders along with Lysenko have come up with Armament Plan C as the newest Armament Plan alongside the highly censored plans A and B.\n\nArmament Plan C, unlike past plans, will be made known to all soldiers in order for them to work together. Plan C will ensure that every soldier within the NKVD is not only able to fire their weapons, but also to make their own weapons in order to be the best army in the Southern Urals. Every battalion will be required to work to make weapons together. Lysenko's reasoning is not only to make the best soldiers, but to make the best camaraderie and strengthen efficiency as they work together in ideal Soviet unionism.\n\nArmament Plans A and B, however, will be Lysenko's main plans which only the highest officers in the NKVD know. He has demanded that if any officers break censorship and have these plans leaked, they will be subjected to experimentation and then executed for treason after their tongues are cut out. As Lysenko sees it, everything must go according to plan, or else state morale will fall apart."
 MGN.102.a: "Plan C is the optimal choice."

 MGN.103.desc: "Change was such a fickle thing, especially in the technocratic realm of Lysenko and his entourage. Seemingly from one day to the next, the overworked and mistreated factory drones that powered the scientist's small empire saw themselves and the Soviet-era capital they were working with completely reorganized and restructured. New guidelines, rules, regulations. Away with waste, away with unnecessary breaks, away with mismanaged logistics.\n\nSudden new orders from the former NKVD guards began to work them worse than any nightmare story they had been told by their childhood bedsides of the old days of emperors and tsars. As one wave of workers was permitted to go home once their torturous shift was done, another was brought in with sullen, broken faces. The thick, cancerous smog, now never retreating from the city no matter the time of day, was beginning to have its effects too. Some wondered if this was what it felt like to be exploited by the Germans, a thought whose utterance would land you a one-way ticket to the mountain complex they all toiled for. This great restructuring of the industry that was proving to be the lifeline of his work had been conceived by the ominous technocrat who ruled almost like the great dictators of the West, moving the populace around like his little chess pieces, maximizing potential value.\n\nFrom the vast array of former scientists that Lysenko had brought with him to Magnitogorsk, a small, efficient minority had now been chosen to head the Supply Production Planning Committee. These management and industry experts were in the process of radically transforming the industrial output of the still ruined city, with its many factories and plants, with the intent that all necessary factors of production for their unbalanced economy, whether that be land, capital, or most importantly, labor, could be utilized to the utmost. Whatever they may cost, innovation and progress were the only things that concerned the former Soviet intelligentsia."

Of these two months, two weeks are to be dedicated specifically to training with advanced weaponry. This is to prevent any further incidents of improperly trained troops mishandling and damaging valuable military equipment.\n\nAll field officers are to spend an additional month being trained in how to command their soldiers in a variety of combat and non-combat situations. Topics to be covered will include leading raids, acquiring test subjects, scouting unknown territory, defending research sites, and others to be detailed in further communiqués.\n\nTest subjects who have been designated for combat training will be subjected to this new regimen as well as any ongoing experiments that they are taking part in.

The Ural Guard is annoyingly attempting to obstruct our research efforts by hindering acquisition teams, preventing them from retrieving the necessary test subjects. In order for our vital experimentation to continue as scheduled, this obstacle must be removed.\n\nThe 22nd Motor Rifle Division carries superior equipment compared to the Guard, but predictive exercises indicate that our force is of insufficient numbers to launch a sustained offensive against the Ural League. One possible method of augmenting the number of troops at our disposal is diplomacy. An alliance with the Dirlewanger Brigade seems the most likely solution if this route is pursued. The Brigade is highly undisciplined and unpredictable, yet they do possess numerical superiority over every other force in the region. They should have enough men at their disposal to defeat the Ural league, especially if our units are acting in support. Intelligence indicates that Dirlewanger's primary goal is to loot Orenburg, but harassment by the Ural Guard has prevented him from achieving this. The elimination of the Ural League would be mutually beneficial to our two parties.\n\nIf this course of action is not desired, there is an alternative. Lysenko believes Dirlewanger and his men would be interesting test subjects if captured alive. Much valuable information could be gained from experiments conducted upon them.

He had gleefully read about his brave bandits partaking in vomit-inducing acts of degeneracy whilst on duty. Despite the constant stream of reports, Dirlewanger never ceased to find pleasure in the misery of his subjects. The Oberführer was expectant, having heard rumors of a horse-bound messenger to arrive. Suddenly, a tremendous bang echoed throughout the Oberführer's chamber, as the imposing oak doors came to rest still on the skull ridden walls. Two aging and disheveled men dressed in worn-out Waffen-SS uniforms aggressively dragged another man across the stone floor towards the 'Bandit King'.\n\nThe two men violently ceased their manhandling of the poor gentleman and moved to either side of the Bandit King's throne, in a protective stance. Clearly, they were ready to brutalize their 'guest'at a moments notice. The quivering envoy slowly rose to his feet, identifying himself as a representative of Lysenko. The envoy then exposed a neatly sealed envelope. His hands shook uncontrollably as he reached out to hand the message to Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger promptly snatched it off the envoy, causing the man to stumble back and wince in fear. The Bandit King ripped apart the envelope to expose its contents, a mere letter. Nothing but a lousy pathetic letter. Despite his unjustified rage, he began to study the contents of the letter, it was noticeably written in quite a technical dialect. He commenced reading the letter before pausing, looking over towards the envoy and grinning menacingly. Finally, Dirlewanger burst out into a deranged fit of uncontrollable laughter. The envoy looked on in astonishment at Dirlewanger, who signaled to his guards to have the man escorted out of his chambers.\n\nA few hours later, the Bandit King called a meeting of his most trusted comrades, to decide what to do with Lysenko's offer. They bickered and bantered, exchange graphic tales of rape and plunder whilst indulging in excessive blood-red wine, sipped from their tin goblets. Eventually, Lysenko's offer resurfaced in conversation. Dirlewanger's now heavily intoxicated inner circle aggressively rambled to one another over the deal. The proposal itself seemed to be positive on the surface. Lysenko offered the Dirlewanger Brigade potential access to Magnitogorsk's industrial facilities and a further promise of potential armaments and munitions supply if necessary. The debate continued well into the early hours of the morning, following further intoxication and a lengthy discussion on barbarism, Dirlewanger and his comrades eventually decided on whether to accept or reject Lysenko's offer for alliance..."

 MGN.111.desc: "The diplomatic mission to the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' bandit group has proven to be successful. Estimates of Oskar Dirlewanger's unpredictability had set the probability of success to a mere 50%, one Comrade Lysenko wisely saw appropriate to take a risk on. A representative of the Dirlewanger Brigade, one -REDACTED-, had been sent in an ill maintained truck, in a manner identical to our own. This behavior is noted to be due to the lack of a diplomatic history from the 'Dirlewanger Brigade'. The letter of approval from the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' was notably written in a curious manner, seemingly penned on the opposite side of Comrade Lysenko's letter. The handwriting is remarkably consistent with studies on individual performance while intoxicated. Regardless, they will be used as a tool to aid in our destruction of the Ural League. Such a result will undoubtedly be beneficial to both Comrade Lysenko and the bandit leader Oskar Dirlewanger. Communications regarding weaponry and mutual tactics will begin shortly."

The decapitated head of -REDACTED-, the diplomat sent to the 'Dirlewanger Brigade', (see anatomy chart and autopsy attached) was reportedly launched at Extraction Team 12's envoy while en route to extract subjects from a local tributary. The Extraction Team immediately returned to the Black Mountain to deliver the head of -REDACTED- to be regarded by Comrade Lysenko, a diversion ruled acceptable by those on site when the nature of their immediate return was discussed. While it is unfortunate that the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' has refused our mutually beneficial pact, it has been assured to all of those in service to Comrade Lysenko that the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' was merely useful, but not necessary for the continued security of the Soviet Union. The superiority of Soviet will triumph over the Ural Guard regardless of the unreliable aid of the 'Dirlewanger Brigade'."

Our chief field researcher, -REDACTED-, delivered a letter personally written by Comrade Lysenko to Oskar Dirlewanger himself. Comrade Lysenko's letter effectively used persuasion and flattery techniques (for further information on the techniques used, pg. 52-89 on persuasion and flattery techniques in espionage handbook.) to masquerade any possible indication of current plans to abduct Oskar Dirlewanger and his band for research purposes. The 'Dirlewanger Brigade' has sent a response envoy, one known as -REDACTED- to confirm the approval of the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' in cooperating with our forces.\n\nImmediately, the envoy was told to return to Oskar Dirlewanger with a second letter, also penned by Comrade Lysenko, informing Oskar Dirlewanger on a location to have a personal meeting for what is described to be regarding the exchange of weapons and discussion of tactics, along with standards for using the technological facilities of the Black Mountain. Unknown to Oskar Dirlewanger is Comrade Lysenko's immediate order to set up positions for the quick capture and extraction of Oskar Dirlewanger and anyone he deems fit to bring with him. Probability of the successful capture of Oskar Dirlewanger in this maneuver has risen to a high 72.4%. Preparations will begin for the capture upon the distribution of this public communique."

Dirlewanger himself was lured to the venue as indicated in previous communiques. However, he has evaded capture by existing military assets on the ground, summarized in addendum 27.b.ii, and his men appear to have dispersed in methods familiar to senior military advisors. The latter observation suggests that methods of evasion are concurrent with the tactics used by Dirlewanger's Brigade veteran training techniques. Capabilities of our current operational assets in capturing Dirlewanger have fallen by 43 percent.\n\nEnvoy -REDACTED- has been liquidated as per Protocol 569E, concerning personnel with potentially compromising evidence involving classified domestic military operations. A request was personally submitted for his liquidation for failure to conduct successful diplomatic activities by the Committee.\n\nHowever, significant strategic opportunities present themselves regardless. Significant reduction in military activities and concentration in Dirlewanger's territory (see strategic report 3.c.iv) has been observed, and military assets outlined in -CLASSIFIED UNDER NKVD DIRECTIVES- are operational and ready to secure territory.

BREAKING OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY WILL RESULT IN LIQUIDATION.\n\nThe abduction of Oskar Dirlewanger and his 'Dirlewanger Brigade' has ended in failure as per original mission parameters. Oskar Dirlewanger accepted Comrade Lysenko's proposition to personally meet for what he assumed to be strategic purposes, with Operational Team 12 preparing an ambush. Dirlewanger and twenty of his soldiers appeared in a convoy for their meeting with Comrade Lysenko. Upon arrival, suspicion was displayed as to the whereabouts of Comrade Lysenko. Comrade Lysenko did not attend due to the substantial risk involved in this operation. Regardless, Oskar Dirlewanger proceeded into the meeting place, setting himself up within a 4.2% difference of planned destination. When Dirlewanger was informed that Comrade Lysenko would not appear, he immediately began egress preparations.\n\nIt appears that Extraction Team 12 was not skillful enough to properly prepare for such an event, as the Extraction Team moved with undue haste to abduct Dirlewanger. Their movements revealed themselves at an improper time, leading to a firefight between the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' and Extraction Team 12. Seventeen of the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' members escaped, with casualties unknown at this time. Dirlewanger himself was shot in chest four times (refer to attached autopsy brief), causing Dirlewanger's death shortly after. While this will certainly lead to the collapse of the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' (refer to Assessment on Dirlewanger Brigade Stability, paragraph 3), the members of Extraction Team 12 are to be promptly liquidated for their complete failure of the mission. The escaping seventeen members have the potential to rally a revenge assault against Comrade Lysenko, and a double increase of patrols along the southwestern border are to begin."

He was quickly disarmed and restrained by the collection team, who took special care to avoid causing excessive physical harm to the primary objective. He too was quickly taken to the transport trucks, and upon his successful delivery the mission was concluded and the trucks began carrying their cargo to the Black Mountain.\n\nThe former bandit king of Russia has been delivered to the personal laboratory of comrade Lysenko, who has already scheduled several experiments designed specifically with Dirlewanger in mind."

However, it has come to our attention that violation of this rule has been more widespread than previously believed. The incident on -DATE REDACTED- involving 130 NKVD personnel, a company in strength, has shown proved our initial estimations have been wrong. A communal punishment-rehabilitation is currently being carried out in holding facilities across our controlled lands. we are confident that more incidents will be revealed to us.\n\nSoviet-era military facilities, as noted in earlier reports, have recorded reduced yields from scavenging activities. It is now clear that this is due to widespread personal acquisition of equipment on a level beyond the individual. In some cases entire stocks of explosives and ammunition, sufficient to arm a battalion for a week, have been siphoned off for personal use and profit by NKVD personnel.\n\nMost disturbing is the testimony of Private -REDACTED-, involved in the incident mentioned above, on whom disciplinary punishments were carried out concurrent with questioning.

 MGN.300.t: "The Elimination of the Southern Obstruction"
 MGN.300.desc: "Reports of resistance from forces identifying as the Dirlewanger Brigade (a.k.a the Black Bandits) have been steadily decreasing following the total collapse of their central leadership in the face of our offensive. Since the initiation of hostilities the unorganized nature of the bandit forces made them vulnerable for well coordinated assaults (for more information see after action reports on operations l-438 and z-19). This allowed the forces of the 22nd Motor Rifle Division to halt their attempted offensives with an 82 percent success rate and launch their own counter offensives into bandit territory. Bandit resistance increased measurably as they retreated further south, in all likelihood due their increasing proximity to their power bases and centers of command. This increase in resistance peaked during the fighting around Orsk (see population center file: Orsk) the unofficial capital of the bandit territory and the site of Dirlewanger's personal headquarters. Conflict was particularly intense within the urban center, but the disorganization of the bandit forces still proved their downfall as the city was surrounded and all resistance within was isolated and eventually terminated.\n\nWith the exception of several hit-and-run raids by isolated bandit groups (see patrol reports 1235, 7532, and 0192) all resistance within the region has come to an end and order is being reestablished. Members of the bandit command have been detained and are scheduled for transport for Magnitogorsk where they will be quarantined assigned to special testing procedures (see special test subject experimentation protocol guidelines). The remaining bandit prisoners are to be held until they can be examined to determine their suitability as potential test subjects. Though heavily damaged by the bandit occupation, the industrial resources of Orsk and the surrounding region will make useful additions to our own industrial base, and reconstruction is scheduled to begin soon."
 MGN.300.a: "わかった。"
 MGN.301.t: "Removal of the Western Obstruction"
 MGN.301.desc: "Despite significant initial resistance, the Ural League has been eliminated as a source of opposition within the region. Following the efforts of the Ural Guard (see opposition force information files 7 and 12) to obstruct the retrieval of testing subjects from the western population centers, their removal was deemed necessary to continue pursuing multiple vital avenues of research. Due to their advanced training (see sub file 12-1 for details on Ural Guard training regimen) and the unfavorable combat conditions of the Ural mountains (see attached elevation map) the initial offensive operation did not prove as successful as hoped, with only 48 percent of units reaching their designated targets within the opening weeks. However, the superior manufacturing base and greater manpower pool of the greater Magnitogorsk area (see most recent census documents) proved decisive, as the Ural Guard were unable to keep their forces sufficiently reinforced and resupplied in periods of extended engagement. As the conflict progressed they were forced back until eventually all significant population centers in the southern Urals were secured and the Guard lacked any functioning command structure.\n\nThe newly acquired territory is low in both population and industrialization. The capture of large numbers of former Ural Guard members has made the conflict a net gain, despite heavy losses (see casualty record filings and equipment loss reports). It has been observed that the average Guard member displays significantly higher strength, stamina, and dexterity than the average inhabitant of the region(see experiment 1961-4-i for specifics). These qualities make them ideal testing candidates for many of the most important experiments being conducted at the Black Mountain involving physical and genetic manipulation. Already approximately 12,000 former Guard members have been identified and detained for transport to testing facilities. Acquisition teams have begun searching the former territory of the Ural league, as it is probable that large numbers of Guard remain in hiding."

 MGN.302.t: "Acquisition of the Southwest Population Center"
 MGN.302.desc: "Resistance within the region surrounding the city of Orenburg (see population center file: Orenburg) has been successfully terminated following the defeat of the militias within the city itself. Despite numerical superiority of opposition forces, the equipment and experience disparity between the communal militias and the 22nd Motor Rifle Division made most attempts at resisting our advance towards the city futile, with 92 percent of offensive operations succeeding in meeting 50 percent or more of initial objectives. (See report collection z-81 for reports of successful defensive actions by communal forces during the conflict). Upon approaching the city, large-scale defensive measures were encountered, including conscripted peasants and hastily constructed barricades and trench networks. These measures, while effective in slowing the offensive by 33 percent, proved insufficient to halt operations entirely; the city was secured shortly after the former government disbanded and fled. Acquisition teams have been dispatched to locate and secure prominent members of said government (see specific testing subject objective list: Orenburg).\n\nThe city is the largest population center in the region (see population estimate files pending replacement by a census), and will allow for a much greater number of testing subjects to be acquired relative to previous measures. This is expected to allow for at least a 45 percent increase in overall testing due to increased subject availability. Additionally, the manufacturing and infrastructure of the region will prove a significant asset to the production capabilities of Magnitogorsk and the southern Urals as a whole as soon as integration and redistribution programmes are completed."

Caretakers were instructed to make no attempt at communication with subjects or with each other while in test environment, including the use of all vocal and visual indicators as well as XXXXXXXX. Subjects were provided standard rations and conditions for their age in all other respects, including XXXXXXXXXX. This environment was to be maintained for an eight-year period designated Phase One. Upon the conclusion of Phase One, subjects' test environments were merged into a single environment and the subjects were introduced to one another. Subject C showed confusion and aggression and irreparably XXXXXXXX Subject E, forcing both to be removed from the experiment. The remaining four showed curiosity and soon began to display affection for one another. Experiment is currently four years into Phase Two with no sign of developing communication besides basic indicators such as crying, laughter, and physical violence.\n\nResult: Inconclusive. If Phase Two continues for four more years and no communication is developed, the experiment will be concluded and a final report logged.

This was to ensure a mental link was established. Subjects were then removed and placed in separate chambers, divided by a soundproof wall. Subjects were interviewed twice a day and told to answer the question that the other subject had been asked.\n\nResult: Experiment terminated. Researcher XXXXXXXX was initially shocked to find that the two subjects began to successfully answer questions that had only been asked to the other subject after only XX weeks of the process. Researcher XXXXXXX was preparing to declare success until an audit found irregularities in the actions of the two subjects. It was eventually discovered that they had somehow convinced the NKVD security guard assigned to the experiment to bring the questions from one subject to the other - he did so by listening in one room, writing down the question on a small piece of paper and then quickly passing it to the subject in the other room by slipping it under the metal door as he pretended to tie the laces of his boots. The experiment was ended, and the guard stripped of all ranks and volunteered as a research subject."

This will incentivize use of captured armaments in the event that their issued weapons are disabled and cannot be promptly repaired or replaced. Likely candidates for the expanded program include modified hunting rifles commonly wielded by the Ural Guard, outdated German weaponry carried by majority of the Dirlewanger Brigade, and old Soviet arms still in use in communes around Orenburg. While these weapons are all of inferior design to those produced in Magnitogorsk, they are widely available in the field.

It is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\n\nA group of ambassadors have been sent to Orenburg to negotiate with Malenkov and his underlings directly, hoping to draft some kind of official strategy as to how we will both work to contain and eliminate the Black Brigade. Negotiations, however, have been slow-going. Malenkov agrees that the Bandit King of the Urals needs to be dealt with at some point in the future, but he has been reluctant to fully surrender strategic control or give command primacy to NKVD troops in the field. He is an idiot in many regards, but at least he is smart enough to guard what power and sovereignty he has.

Two men, clad in antiquated uniforms belonging to a country since passed, step out into the breezy night air. One admires the night sky for a moment, the other simply steps further out and digs his hands through his pockets. They reconvene after a moment, and light a flimsy cigarette. Silently, save for the occasional restrained cough, they make it burn.\nBehind them, the truck explodes, painting the world orange and red and gray. The soldiers recover their footing, and turn around in shock and worry. Into the night, a single silhouette sprints away. One man pulls out his gun, and fires at the diminishing shadow, but to no avail. The figure has disappeared into the night as soon as it came.\n\nPerhaps it was some vengeful civilian, angry for the loss of a loved one, or an ideologically-enraged partisan, but whatever the motive, the fact remains that the soldiers' truck is gone.

The boy struggled to make his way through the breadline that, like a long snake of people chattering, coiled around a building - at a corner, a uniformed guard holding a rifle broke up a fight between two drunkards. Kirill waved to a girl he recognized, who smiled at him while holding her coughing mother's hand. The building used to be a storehouse for industrial materials - after the NKVD took control of the Black Mountain, it became a centre for distribution of food and medicines to the people who couldn't afford it. The walls were now adorned by the hammer, the sickle and the sword of the NKVD soldiers' uniform. Kirill crossed the street and turned left, passing by two soldiers laughing and smoking cigarettes. Behind them, a freshly glued poster picturing Bunkov watched over them; the solders didn't seem to mind the silent observer. Finally, Kirill walked along the footpath before reaching his home. He knocked and was greeted by his mother and little sister. Just a few metres ahead, a soldier standing on a watchtower turned to look at them, before sighing, adjusting his blue cap and going back to look towards the sunset.\nThe sun would dawn again, and another soldier would still be there, on the watchtower - and when the sun would fall again, someone else, still wearing the same uniform, would still be standing on that watchtower, observing Kirill returning home after school. Being watched by the NKVD is something the people of Magnitogorsk are getting used to, and soon enough living under their watchful eye became a habit. In time, most would never have experienced life without frequent visits from commissars and soldiers. Still, some say that it doesn't have to be like this, that it shouldn't be like this - but those who say such things too carelessly usually don't last very long."

While defenses are necessary to our survival, especially in Russia, there is a point where they devolve into mad paranoia. Soldiers of the NKVD are forces to walk down the mountain in complicated serpentine patterns to avoid landmines or stake filled pits, and navigating the deeper recesses of the mountain require us to trace our route with string like the Theseus of legend, lest we get lost in the purposefully winding labyrinth of the structure.\n\nDemolition and dismantlement has begun, with engineer teams carefully trying their best to ensure the safety of every man who dares walk down the mountainous slopes or steps out of his barracks to relieve himself.\n\nAlready, six have died in the efforts. Either from poorly constructed traps and explosive devices releasing and detonating at the slightest touch, or by stumbling upon traps that had been long lost to record. Several traps seem to have even be constructed at some point by those outside of the NKVD, and without our knowledge, seemingly built explicitly to kill any poor fool chosen to disarm others.\n\nProgress is slow, but it is sure.

But unlike those young men who looked up to him, he did not pretend as if it was Lysenko who had made them the monsters. He had personally shoved men into the back of trucks to send them to gulags, shot prisoners as a part of some grand political game, and had looked away as Lysenko and his cronies stuck children with all manners of pricks and needles.

When the platoon was in the middle of their task they were hit with heavy rifle fire coming from all directions, the Chekist shot back but soon it was clear that the situation was unsustainable and a retreat was ordered, the village narrow streets become a trap, turning the soldiers into easy prey and leaving most of the platoon dead before they could leave.\n\nCommissar Georgy reached for the Maxim machine gun installed back of the truck, just like the Tachankas of old, and started firing at the attackers that were mowing down his men, he hoped that he could at least save a few of them but it was soon clear that those who were not killed in the streets were getting shot running on fields, when his last round of ammunition was spent he knew that he could only save himself. Taking opportunity from a break in the fire coming from the village, he tried to get the truck running but the old machine wouldn't start, and slowly people from the village started gathering around it.\n\nThe commissar got out of the vehicle and desperately started talking with one of the men \"Listen Comrade, I am a commissar of the NKVD, we are here to help you, here take this...\" and gave the man his canteen.\n\nThe Commissar's body was soon found hanging from a tree with a sign that read \"He will never take our sons again\"."

He was reminded of mornings learning how to hunt with his father, and Christmas mornings playing outside in the snow with his sister. But now, on this sunny, idyllic day, he was being hunted like the rabbits he ate. Out of the corner of his right ear, he heard the shot of a handgun, and then a scream. Then, to his left. Another shot and another scream. His hand shook so much as to drop the old revolver he held in it. He would not go silent into that good night. Back in the years before the war, his loving father had been taken by the NVKD. He would not fall to the same fate. His own bullets would go into his own brain before he let himself surrender to those mongrels.\n\nIt had all begun when a beggar on the street threw to him a small booklet. What he had expected to be a little pamphlet calling for prayer was a scathing criticism and expose on the nature of the new NKVD ruled government. It must have been intended for another man, a braver man. But the man who hid in the thorn bushes was intrigued. He stayed up reading it all, the little booklet printed on thin paper and held together by flimsy rings. Then, he hid it as deep as he could under his bed.\n\nThe next thing the man knew, he had become a member of a small resistance group. Fighting for the freedom of his settlement and from the tyrannical government that lorded over him, he distributed leaflets, set traps, and generally undermined authority. Everything seemed to be looking up, until the ambush began.\n\nNow, the man's friends and comrades were dead, and he had reverted to his cowardliness.

It became especially clear during the times when Lysenko waged an open war against his own people for his anti-humane experiments. Even though Lysenko is gone, the people are still reluctant to obey the governmental orders and continue to regard any state interference as an act of violence towards them.\n\nIt is clear that in such situation we can't afford to rely on terror and coercion as measures to keep the population in line with our order, as long as the memory of Lysenko's nightmare is still fresh in memory. Thereby, we give to the residents of Magnitogorsk all liberties they need but were deprived of for so long a time. We won't allow the situation in the countryside to ever fall to the anarchy of the past as long as we stand, and we shall not interfere with their lives as long as they faithfully perform their duties and do not stand against us. Seeing our benevolent nature and convincing themselves in our well-meaning intentions, the population of Magnitogorsk will cease its attempts to topple our rule and will be dutifully working for the good of their new nation.\n\nWithout a glance at the lands of milk and honey of Orenburg or the safety of the League, they instead will be laboring to build a better future here, around the Black Mountain.

Most agree this is because of an easing of restrictions on civilian populations, and some suggest not letting the peasants roam so freely. Reintroducing lists that would state civilian names and would serve to limit freedom of movement within our territory and generally restrict civilian life to those on a list. While some urge strongly against a return to Lysenko's insane tyranny, others state that to maintain the safety of not just the leadership, but the civilians, these restrictions must be put into place. The upside about these lists is that we could use remaining infrastructure from Lysenko's reign, and introducing them would be of low cost.

Such a heavy burden falls onto our weary shoulders, consolidating Orenburg will be long and arduous task. However, there are multiple ways in which we could control the communes apart from a direct annexation. The first and easiest option, as well as the one the communes will be more likely accept, is honoring the strength of our alliance by culminating our diplomatic relations into a friendship agreement. The other is offering the communes autonomy within our greater state and letting them keep their anarchist lifestyle in their settlements in exchange for troops and taxes. The second option is better for us, it would mean not having to deal with the problems of annexation and would provide more benefits than a friendship agreement. Of course, the Workers Council will not be so welcoming of this request, our move being too similar to the one the one many had warned the Guards would take.

 MGN_NKVD.1201.desc: "The familiar sight of NKVD trucks would greet many citizens although today, for the first time, they came with a different purpose. Per Bunkov's orders, the NKVD arrived not to gather men for Lysenko but to enforce the peace in a fragile region. Some argue that the move is a rather blunt one and there are some suggestions that, should we act too hastily, we should expect resistance. Our motives are pure, however, and surely we have nothing to fear."
 MGN_NKVD.1201.a: "We must pursue order aggressively."
 MGN_NKVD.1201.b: "We must not be heavy-handed."
 MGN_NKVD.1202.t: "We Were Misguided"
 MGN_NKVD.1202.desc: "Our efforts to maintain power following the removal of Lysenko has met a significant roadblock, mainly in that much of the population still remain wary of our men, whilst many more remain utterly uncooperative. To counteract this, Bunkov has declared his intent to address the issue of our involvement with Lysenko directly through radio address, hoping that even the far flung villages would have at least one functioning radio. The details of this speech have not been fully planned yet and debate has raged over to what extent our NKVD played in assisting Lysenko, and how much of this we should relay to the population.\n\nEventually, after exhaustive arguments made by both side of the argument, Bunkov made his decree clear..."
 MGN_NKVD.1202.a: "We must downplay our role."
 MGN_NKVD.1202.b: "We must tell the truth."
 MGN_NKVD.1203.t: "Payment Is Due"
 MGN_NKVD.1203.desc: "Perhaps the most convenient, surviving part of Lysenko's regime was the man's obsession with lists upon lists, records upon records, and more copious details than we initially knew what to do with. We have the names of every living former experiment and we know how to find them. As has become increasingly clear over time, the tendency of these former experiments toward dissent and disruption has become increasingly clear and we must make sure they understand under who they work.\n\nThe last few days has seen extensive and rapid action as per our leader's orders, as NKVD regiments hunt down and corner these potential threats, wherever they might have scurried to. Now rounded up, they are to be told that..."
 MGN_NKVD.1203.a: "Every man must fight."
 MGN_NKVD.1203.b: "Every man must serve."
 MGN_NKVD.1203.c: "Every man must believe."
 MGN_NKVD.1204.t: "Threatening Loved Ones"
 MGN_NKVD.1204.desc: "Dissent persists within the ranks of the citizens, those who do not understand their place now, especially amongst the former experiments. Our latest order ensures that their loyalty to the regime is tied to something tangible and, more importantly, something which will not allow them to become martyrs. This insignificant display of resistance ends now, so that we may focus on other matters."
 MGN_NKVD.1204.a: "Thank you for your cooperation."
 MGN_NKVD.1205.t: "Conscription in the NKVD?"
 MGN_NKVD.1205.desc: "最高司令部内の多くの将校が予想しているように、将来のウラル連盟との戦いでは我々は特に人的資源の面において代償を払うことはもはや明白だ。そのため、我々の現在施行している徴兵法が効果的であるかどうか、また先頭を目前にして準備ができるのかどうかについての激しい議論がなされている。"
 MGN_NKVD.1205.a: "人的資源は最重要だ"
 MGN_NKVD.1205.b: "議論はここまでだ、我々の兵は十分戦える！"
 MGN_NKVD.1206.t: "Rogue State of the League"
 MGN_NKVD.1206.desc: "A historical tangent, previously extensively written reports from the dastardly Lysenko and our own scout sightings have given us the necessary information concerning the strange army with a state, the so-called protectors of the Ural steppes, the League. And as some of the senior NKVD commissars sat together on a cool wintry night, rereading and brooding on those reports it suddenly became very apparent that the League needed to be exterminated if the NKVD security state is to persist in this harsh world without a clear challenge. A mortal rivalry between the two militaries was bound to occur otherwise. After all, the guards represented everything wrong with the treasured Union that fell to the degenerate Nazi onslaught, the weak, the traitors, the criminals, the church. A cold fury descended onto the commissars as they finished reading, every day that bastard nation continues to exist, and so close to their core territory, was a stain of disgrace on the NKVD legitimacy and reputation. The soldiers were not to find out about who it was they would be killing, it would be a sweeping operation with no survivors."
 MGN_NKVD.1206.a: "Natural order has to be restored."
 MGN_NKVD.1075.t: "Dawn Reaches Magnitogorsk"
 MGN_NKVD.1075.desc: "Dawn stretches across the smogs of the Black Mountain, and, on occasion, pierces, landing upon the stones below. The Technocratic Order has reached it's end, and in its stead shall be built a society guided by the Luminary of Bolshevism. The People have been drawn from their mines, the Subjects freed from their chambers. In shambles, yet no longer in chains.\nBeneath the dawnstruck stones, an unfamiliar smoke begins to mundanely rise into the smog of the Black Mountain."
 MGN_NKVD.1075.a: "It is done"
 MGN_NKVD.1076.t: "Under the Dawnstruck Stones"
 MGN_NKVD.1076.desc: "Deep within the belly of the Black Mountain, those few administrators, scientists, and yes-men who have yet to find themselves mingling in the smogs of Magnitogorsk remain. They are there for one of two reasons - their minds and bodies are still needed for the extraction of information, or they deserve far worse than a single, quick and meager death.\n\nThey are left in a stark, black, silence for most of the day. Occasionally they are drawn from their chambers in short intervals for intelligence extraction or to be tortured. The two are very often one and the same, a fitting conclusion for the men who converted thousands of lives into digits and charts. Only when they have outlived their use, or become incapable of experiencing any greater an agony, are they then added to the smokestacks.\n\nIf you wish to see what justice looks like, look to the black smoke from a nameless facility south of Magnitogorsk. There, rising in greasy fumes to the sky, is where true penitence is, and boundless, boundless sorrow."
 MGN_NKVD.1076.a: "Let there be nothing left!"
 MGN_NKVD.1077.t: "The Greatest Threat"
 MGN_NKVD.1077.desc: "The threat posed by Dirlewanger's brigade is enormous; an insane group of lunatics more unhinged then even our previous dictator is something rarely found. If we sit still any longer without taking action towards the existential threat posed by those fascists, we risk perishing ourselves. Therefore, it is imperative that we take action as soon as possible to repel, or, more optimistically, destroy Dirlewanger and his Nazi bandits. The high command has discussed a number of battle plans that have been constructed in an effort to settle on one military action that can be taken, even seeking a possible alliance with our neighbors to deal with the issue. Currently, a strong spearhead into the chief camp of the Brigade seems to be the optimal option, but even something like this could fail in the face of Dirlewanger's hardy bandits. For now, we can do nothing but wait and plan as fascist rats fester on our borders."
 MGN_NKVD.1077.a: "Our time will be coming soon..."
 MGN_NKVD.1078.t: "The Enemy Of Our Enemy"
 MGN_NKVD.1078.desc: "The 22nd motor division might be one of the strongest professional army divisions left in the former Soviet Union, but to face down the accursed Dirlewanger brigade it might not be enough. We lack the manpower to both defend Magnitogorsk itself from a possible invasion by the Germans and their pet Russians and also deploy men in the field to defeat the Brigade decisively.\nIn the west stands the loose confederation of communes centered onto Orenburg city. The local don't stack up very well to a proper army, or even to veteran bandits like Dirlewangers men, but the communal militias are certainly numerous and quite desperate. If we could ally with even a fraction of the communes we would have the men to cut off any easy path of retreat west of the Ural to Dirlewanger. If the city of Orenburg itself was to join other communes in an alliance with us, the combination of our army with Orenburg's guard and a bunch of smaller militias could be just enough men on the ground to defeat the black brigade.\nAs the Ural League has learned to its frustrations, the people of Orenburg are skeptical of centralized groups in general, especially a well armed one such as ourselves. Negotiations to get them to fight with us will be difficult...But Magnitogorsk is not without a certain quantity of resources that various factions and political groups in Orenburg city covet. A deal might still happen if we play our cards right."
 MGN_NKVD.1078.a: "Let's see what these anarchists have to offer us."
 MGN_NKVD.1079.t: "Our Friend Malenkov"
 MGN_NKVD.1079.desc: "It seems that we are not as alone in the Urals as we once thought ourselves to be. Georgy Malenkov, a politician of prominence back in the days of Bukharin, has come to power as the premier of Orenburg, and it seems that he is of a far more centralized mindset than his comrades. While hardly a great luminary of the Soviet era, he can nonetheless be of great use to us as an ally. And seeing how we are surrounded by degenerates and counter-revolutionaries on all sides, we will need all the help we can possibly get, so we cannot afford to be too selective.\n\nPreliminary ambassadors have already been sent, and discussions have begun concerning things like military equipment and material that we could generously donate to them. They seem to be receptive to the idea, though it very well might be that they're simply desperate for whatever firepower they can get their greedy little hands on. But what other choice do we have to win them over?"
 MGN_NKVD.1079.a: "They have chosen the right person."
 MGN_NKVD.1090.t: "The Traitor Burba"
 MGN_NKVD.1090.desc: "Aleksander Burba was not the man we wanted in charge of the Orenburg Communes. He does not believe in Communist values, nor is he aligned with the interests of the NKVD. After all, we didn't overthrow Lysenko simply to bend to another degenerate technocrat's will. However, with the growing strength and aggressiveness of Dirlewanger's brigade, we may be forced to align with Burba, at least temporarily, in order to destroy the bandit \"king\" and euthanize his pack of rabid animals.\n\nWe need to decide quickly, lest we give Dirlewanger the chance to strike first. Do we preserve our integrity as the true protectors of Communism, or will we sacrifice our values for the sake of survival and the Orenburg peasantry?"
 MGN_NKVD.1090.a: "This was not the outcome we wanted."
 MGN_NKVD.1091.t: "The Dirlewanger Question"
 MGN_NKVD.1091.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger and his gang of fascist bandits continue to be a thorn in our side, raiding our border territories and slaughtering villages there for their own profit and amusement. Thankfully, we are not the only people he has chosen to incite - he has long been a pestilence on our brave comrades in Orenburg. Feeble-minded as he may be, Malenkov nevertheless should be able to comprehend just how much of a threat the Brigade is to the continued survival of socialist thought in the Urals. It is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\n\nA group of ambassadors have been sent to Orenburg to negotiate with Orenburg directly, hoping to draft some kind of official strategy as to how we will both work to contain and eliminate the Black Brigade. Negotiations, however, have been slow-going. Malenkov agrees that the Bandit King of the Urals needs to be dealt with at some point in the future, but he has been reluctant to fully surrender strategic control or give command primacy to NKVD troops in the field. They are an idiot in many regards, but at least they are smart enough to guard what power and sovereignty he has. We must be content with vague promises and empty handshakes for now, and focus more on finding ways to fully alleviate their doubts about us."
 MGN_NKVD.1091.a: "Better than nothing."
 MGN_NKVD.1092.t: "The Science"
 MGN_NKVD.1092.desc: "In the aftermath of Lysenko, we have to find something to do about the madman's so-called \"science\", and the science of the Black Mountain.\n\nTwo choices are presented to us. For one, we could throw it all away, getting rid of all the mad scientist's disturbed beliefs and outright untrue and harmful \"socialist\" beliefs in the field of science. This would result in a subsequent purging of all of the documents of Lysenko, and all of his advisors, we must\n\nSecondly, we could make our way through all these documents in an attempt to find something that will be of use. This will probably end as a useless waste of time, but will result in Lysenko's comrades getting out alive. What should we do on the matter?"
 MGN_NKVD.1092.a: "There's no use in his foolish escapades."
 MGN_NKVD.1092.b: "Perhaps, under all the failure, there is truth."
 MGN_NKVD.1060.t: "Wake Up Call"
 MGN_NKVD.1060.desc: "Perhaps a gun can defend a man's family. But a starving man can't hold a gun, and a gun can't build itself. Our workers and peasants must know their vital role in our society through any means, we will not tolerate provocative behavior that would risk our workers' morale and motivation to work and produce for their people. We will impose harsher quotas, and promote productivity within our society by setting up commissars and bureaucrats in the workplace and establish proper control and order in the fields and in the factories. It's time to deal with \"demoralizing\" elements of society more accordingly."
 MGN_NKVD.1060.a: "This should motivate them..."
 MGN_NKVD.1060.b: "No. We have faith in our people."
 MGN_NKVD.1061.t: "The Trials"
 MGN_NKVD.1061.desc: "Since we rescued former League citizens from the terror of Lysenko we have brought a potential danger into our newly liberated society. We can't walk in our own streets knowing that some of our very own citizens and comrades are conspiring with the man across the Urals. To secure our people from these traitors and traitorous sentiments, we must work in an unconventional, yet familiar manner. The 22nd will work swiftly and efficiently. Conducting secret trials, Interrogations, exiles and executions on suspected \"League associates\" will assure the loyalty and cooperation of our citizens in the face of Uralic aggression."
 MGN_NKVD.1061.a: "Back into the cage."
 MGN_NKVD.1061.b: "They suffered enough already."
 MGN_NKVD.1062.t: "The Speech"
 MGN_NKVD.1062.desc: "A poster at every street corner, at every factory and at every train station. Radio stations will be set up, buzzing with speeches from Stepan Bunkov. The common man of Magnitogorsk will be flooded by depictions of the NKVD's brave struggle against the bandits and Lysenko, by bombastic speeches and by parades in the streets. The people must hear the word of their friends and guardians, and as long as a single man could go through a day without seeing, reading or listening to our message, we have failed our mission."
 MGN_NKVD.1062.a: "Turn on the printers!"
 MGN_NKVD.1062.b: "This is unnecessary..."
 MGN_NKVD.1063.t: "The Fate of the Communes"
 MGN_NKVD.1063.desc: "We press ever forward, and now that the communes are under our watch, we have encountered a dilemma. Orenburg being the largest city in the Southern Urals, we now have a large and unruly populace unaccustomed to our... variation of rule. Our choices are simple. We imprison the angry masses, execute the dissenters, and send our own settlers, or we spare the people, brave the storm, and create unity between the mountain and the city."
 MGN_NKVD.1063.a: "They cannot be controlled."
 MGN_NKVD.1063.b: "A solution for the future is in order."
 MGN_NKVD.1064.t: "Adjustment"
 MGN_NKVD.1064.desc: "Life under NKVD watch isn't as different as some would have thought. There are trucks of soldiers roaming the streets, and rationing is a little stricter, but other than that, life is fine. There are even new civilians from the east moving in. I think that, eventually, we can learn to coexist with these people. Unless, of course, you're a dissenting opinion."
 MGN_NKVD.1064.a: "And so, life goes on..."
 MGN_NKVD.1065.t: "Internment"
 MGN_NKVD.1065.desc: "They come on trucks, in bands of 5 or 7. They wear black wool masks, with a red star on their olive green rags. They knock, they enter, and they take. Nobody asks questions because they fear they will be taken too. If there is no response on the other side, they enter anyway. Nobody knows where they come from or where they go. They take, and those taken do not return. They are relocated, but to where is uncertain. Some say they are shot out of town. Some say they are used as slaves. But nobody truly knows."
 MGN_NKVD.1065.a: "We did what was necessary."
 MGN_NKVD.2000.t: "The Red Dawn - Dirlewanger's Fall"
 MGN_NKVD.2000.desc: "Some fights happen once. Others are reflected once and twice and thrice, down the narrow alleyway of history, in scuffed mirrors and twisted reflections. This is the price of a broken world; endless fights for justice that smolder on, even when the fire gutters out.\n\nSome of the last remaining operational units of the Red Army's internal security and intelligence division have managed to destroy a group of bandits by the name of \"Dirlewanger's Brigade\", one which clings to the Organization of an SS Brigade.\n\nThe NKVD's victory over Dirlewanger sends both good and ill omens to the citizens under the reign of the New Red Black Mountain. On one hand, the psychopathy and outright madness of Dirlewanger shall no longer be a threat to all who cowered under his heel, and his banditry and the many crimes of his cronies shall be brought to justice. On the other hand, the NKVD is an ominous black space, even if it shrouds itself with the insignia and symbolism of the Red, and who knows how far Lysenko's shadow has been purged from its system?\n\nThe Urals tremble. A new Red Dawn descends upon the old hills. Little knows what it might bring."
 MGN_NKVD.2000.a: "Impressive."
 MGN_NKVD.2001.t: "Red Dawn - Ural Eclipse"
 MGN_NKVD.2001.desc: "Many said it was inevitable; the militarized, interventionist Ural League and the militarized, revolutionary NKVD in Black Mountain would eventually be at each others' throats. Even so, it was shocking to see how quickly relations between the two powerhouses degenerated into terrible conflict.\n\nNow the Red Flag flies on the remains of Ust-Katav and the League is scattered to the hills. The struggle has concluded. Menviks himself is nowhere to be found; NKVD statements and press reports claim he is dead, but the rosary he was known to carry was not found on the battlefield they claimed he fell on. Given the huge amount of respect and affection he received from his citizens, it is likely he was smuggled out to some other obscure corner of Russia to spend the rest of his pious days. Perhaps a hooded county priest will look up from his duties every so often and think of the land he once called home, weeping.\n\nAs for the fate of the former League's inhabitants, no one can say for sure. The NKVD has taken great pains to paint a reassuring palette of its policies, portraying itself as a Great Vanguard bringing civilization and revolutionary justice, but no one forgets their complicity in Lysenko's atrocities, and the question of just how much iron lies behind their silken rhetoric is something no one likes to think about.\n\nNo matter what the future holds, one thing is clear; the Red Dawn now kisses the Ural Mountains themselves, and the balance of power is forever changed. The Revolution smolders on."
 MGN_NKVD.2001.a: "One bear has clawed another to death."
 MGN_NKVD.2002.t: "Red Dawn - Left Unity"
 MGN_NKVD.2002.desc: "The Communes of Orenburg were always a contradiction, a state built around an ideology requiring its dissolution to be fulfilled. And there were many problems with how it was run, and the endless tightrope of popular consensus it had to navigate to get legislation into the books. But as the gunfire from the last militia outposts dies down and the Councilors scurry into exile and anonymity, it is clear that this experiment, flawed or successful, is now over. In its place stands a new Red Vanguard, and the bloody truism of Socialist Unity.\n\nThe Communes have fallen apart utterly; their Council (and Chairman) scattered, their local infrastructures supplanted or destroyed by purge, the ramshackle system which supported Orenburg is now gone, and over Orenburg itself a new red flag now flies. Lists are being drawn up with the methodical, scrupulous brutality inherent to the NKVD, and slowly those deemed as Revisionists and Traitors to the Socialist Cause are interned, tried and rehabilitated. Some disappear off the lists entirely, and it is best not to think too hard (or loudly) about their fates.\n\nIt is unclear if the residents of the Communes will acclimatize to their new Socialism, run from Black Mountain, and if they prefer their new Commissars over their old fractious Councilors and representatives. The NKVD reports are all positive in their confidence, of course; and they will continue to stay positive. No matter what. Time will tell if the residents of the ex-Communes feel the same.\n\nAnd observers in neighboring lands shake their heads sadly, knowing the old truth; that the Red Banner, in spreading, will always smother its own."
