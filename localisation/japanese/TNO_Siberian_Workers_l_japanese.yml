 POLITICS_VITALY_KOSTIN_DESC: "ヴィタリー・セミョーノヴィチ・コスティンは、最近まで何者でも無かった。彼は、1938年にアルタイの小さな村落に生まれ、若いときから早くも採掘に関わるようになった。中央シベリア共和国の軍隊に短期間従事したが、その緩みと最終的な崩壊の直接の目撃者となった。その後ノヴォシビルスクに行き、軍としてのキャリアを続けようとしていた。コスティンは他の人々が持っていたような、体制の信念との癒着を欠いており、社会主義ポピュリストである「ナロードニキ」の地下組織との繋がりが噂されていたのにも関わらず、彼は模範的な労働者となった。彼は特に他のロシア軍閥との政治的関連性もない採掘師だった―暴動が始まるまでは。\n\n中央シベリアの復活した権威に対し、最後の抵抗をすると決めた後、街や村の労働者階級は、彼らが抑圧者と認識した者に対し、武器を取った。関門という関門が寄せ集めの民兵によって突破されたという知らせが地域の統治者に到達し、再び実効支配が徐々に揺らいでるように思われた。この大暴動の長がコスティンだった。彼はプロレタリアートを勝利に導ける機会を逃さなかったのだ。\n\nかつての一般市民は解放運動のリーダーとなったが、彼はその王でも大統領でも最高指導者でもない。解放されたコミュニティには、自由社会主義の形態が現れてきており、その体制に単一の指導者は存在しない。ヴィタリー・コスティンが望むことは、人々が自由で平等であることだけであり、それに全面的な革命が必要なら、全面的な革命を起こすまでなのである。"
 POLITICS_IVAN_SEVASTYANOV_DESC: "Ivan Pavlovich Sevastyanov first became known in Central Siberia for his important work in the late stages of the Siberian Plan. As a young engineer and former CPSU official, he helped steer the project in the right direction, and ensured that it was successful and had the long-term effects it had.\n\nHis sympathy to Bolshevik ideals was known, but due to his usefulness and skill, was largely ignored until the Workers' Federation swept through the region, and Sevastyanov grabbed the chance to declare a reformed socialist republic covering territories he knew all too well. Contrarily to his allies, he has taken a different approach to his rule, giving power to the Soviets and forming a strong executive authority around him.\n\nIt has been effective, as tremendous economic growth was soon noticed, and more focus is put on the industry than ever. Of all the new states founded between Omsk and Irkutsk, Sevastyanov's one could be said to be the one closest to the old USSR."
 POLITICS_MARIA_BORCHENKO_DESC: "Maria Yakovlevna Borchenko may have become the honorary leader of the Siberian Workers' and Peasants' Union, but only a few years ago no one would have guessed that a humble farmer could have become a rising star in the socialist sphere in Central Siberia.\n\nShe was born in a village of the Altai plateau, and worked in farms throughout the rule of Bukharin, the CSR and the Federation. It did not take long until her admiration of socialism drew her close to Narodnik circles, where she argued for the rights of the neglected peasants.\n\nHer time to shine came, later, though, as with the region in open revolt, she rallied the people of Altai into a separate rebellion. Thus, the Workers' and Peasants' Union was created: a peaceful state formed by the lower class, for the lower class. Maria may be its leader, but in her eyes the true control rests in the people, those working hard in the factories and farms."

If we think of this as similar to the Great Patriotic War, we will have lost it before we have even begun.\n\nRather, comrades, it is important to think of yourselves and your brigade as cells, all making up distinct portions of a greater whole. You work independently of one another, cooperating when need be, but, fundamentally, working alone, distinct and unique in their purpose and make up. To fight a war like this you will pounce upon the slightest sign of weakness of our enemies.\n\nIt is one thing to fight against an enemy head on.

Kostin was to baptize his newly created nation; that which was born in the fires of his revolution.\n\n\"Brothers! Sisters! COMRADES! I formally welcome you to our first Worker's Congress!\" His opening was met with an overwhelming roar of cheers and applause.\n\n\"Today we shall create a federation which is founded by the worker, for the worker! A place where the working class shall hold the reins of power, and not those greedy bureaucrats who grow fat off the fruit of our labor! A new sort of society shall arise in our federation: guided by the might of the unions!\" This time, there was noticeably less applause. Kostin felt a shiver down his spine.

The working men of the unions shall form the bedrock of an entirely new kind of civilization. Merit, not birth, shall determine your standing in our society!\"\n\nDead silence. Kostin broke out into a cold sweat. They clearly did not like what they were hearing. In the back of the crowd, he could see some of his comrades beginning to leave the building. \"Yes, well, any questions before we proceed, comrades?\"\n\n\"Oh, where the hell do I even begin?!\" Someone shouted from the back.

 kostin.19.d: "One speech. One speech was all it took to undo all of Vitaly Kostin's triumphs. Against all the odds, Kostin had gone from a humble miner in Altay to the leader of a fiery worker's revolution. Nobody thought he could do it, of course, for his enemies were simply too strong. Despite all of the naysayers and defeatists, Kostin and his comrades defied expectation and liberated the long-oppressed workers of Siberia.\n\nYet, despite the miraculous nature of Kostin's victory, it was simply not to last. The Worker's Congress was supposed to be the finale to a long string of victories, the event that would cement Kostin's place in history as a great liberator of the working class. Instead, it was a poorly-planned disaster that resulted in Kostin going from hero to class traitor virtually overnight.\n\nKostin was never one for words. He was a blue-collar working man, after all, not a poet or a politician. Speeches were certainly not his strong suit, and the debacle at the congress was proof of that. Kostin himself only wanted what was best for the workers, even if he wasn't the best at explaining how.\n\nRegardless, the damage was done. Three separate nations had split from Kostin's federation in protest of his unfortunate speech, and Central Siberia was now just as divided as it was at the turn of the decade. Nearly as soon as it began, Kostin's revolution was ground into dust.\n\nAlthough he only controlled a quarter of the Worker's Federation's former territories, the humble Kostin remained determined to make the best of his unfortunate situation; following the ideals that ignited his revolution as best he could."

 POLITICS_STEPAN_VALENTEEV_DESC: "The fascinating experiment of the Siberian Black Army has left a long-lasting impact on Central Siberia, and this is made clear by the existence of the Free Workers' Republic of Siberia. Headed by the most senior member of the Black Army, Stepan Yeliseyevich Valenteyev, it has taken much inspiration from the former Army whose territory the Republic now occupies.\n\nAfter the recent events, the remnants of the Black Army reformed their theory of militarized anarchy, and now claim to practice the doctrine of the People's Fight, the protracted armed struggle of a rural population against its enemies for the maintenance of the \"free territory\".\n\nValenteev is left as an unwilling leader of this movement, as it diverges further and further away from the anarchist vision he had fought for. Yet with or without his support, the ideas have definitely embedded themselves in the hearts and minds of the local population."

 KAL_the_last_fight_desc: "Excerpt from Speech by Kostin to a Worker's Battalion:\n\n\"Comrades, listen to me: the enemy is preparing for the final battle. The capitalists are working their wage-slaves to the bone, the generals drilling their men into a blood frenzy, and the papers are spreading lies about the so-called 'revolutionary terror'. They are ready to destroy us.\n\nBut we have not been idle, friends. We, too, have been preparing for the assault they plan to unleash upon us. We have placed a gun in every able body man and woman in our Federation, making any victory they lay upon us a bitter one indeed.\n\nEvery one of our cities is a fortress from which only the atom bomb itself can drive us from, and even then only barely. We welcome their challenge. I, for one, am willing to die for the revolution -- as every good socialist is. Our sacrifice is but just one more chain in the long march of history. We will be remembered as heroes, comrades. And nothing they can do can stop that.\""
