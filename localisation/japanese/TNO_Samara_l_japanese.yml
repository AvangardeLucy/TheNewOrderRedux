 POLITICS_VIKTOR_POLYAKOV_DESC: "ヴィクトル・ニコラエヴィチ・ポリャーコフは、北西にいる同僚と同じように、権力を押し付けられるまでは一介の工場長であった。シベリアで生まれた彼は、急速に崩壊しつつあったWRRFの産業顧問としてヴォルガ河畔の都市サマラに派遣され、数年間はそこで活動していた。ポリャーコフは自動車産業で出世し、同じ市場でカトゥーシェフに対抗するまでになった。\n\nその結果、彼はサマラで名を知られるようになり、やがてサマラの人民議会議長、市長に選ばれたのである。ポリャーコフは現在、経済活動と、北ロシアの意向に沿った原始的で脆弱な民主主義国家の統治を両立させている。\n\n軍人として統治するというのは、経験の浅い人間には難しいことであるが、ポリャーコフは、本当に困った時はニジニ・ノヴゴロドの仲間に頼れば良いと思っている。"

 SAM_german_bootlickers_desc: "「我らはボリシェヴィズムの赤いくびきからロシアを解放する先鋒である」こう我々は主張したいのだが、誰もが我々をドイツの傀儡と考えており、それゆえに我々を憎んでいる。さらに残念なことに、我々は主人であるドイツからですら愛してもらえず、彼らは我々を反乱分子の群れとして見捨てている。"
 SAM_The_Smolensk_Manifesto: "スモレンスク宣言"
 SAM_The_Smolensk_Manifesto_desc: "西ロシア戦争中に発表された宣言は、一部の者にはロシア解放軍の正当性を証明し、それ以外の者には救いようのない背信行為を証明するものになっている。この宣言では、ロシアの共産主義に反対し、ソ連に代わる新しい共和国の実現を目指すことを表明している。この宣言は自暴自棄になったドイツの宣伝者によって作成されたにも関わらず、我々の正当性を主張する中核的な要素であり続けている。"
 SAM_German_Military_Training: "ドイツ式軍事訓練"
 SAM_German_Military_Training_desc: "ロシア解放軍が単なる植民地の民兵であった頃、ドイツは人間以下の支援者に軍事訓練と野蛮な規律を課すことに固執していた。西ロシア戦争では、旧赤軍の退役軍人とともに兵力が膨れ上がり、彼らの勇敢さは決死の戦いで試された。このように、ロシア解放軍は西ロシアでは数少ない職業軍である。"
 SAM_Turncoat_General: "裏切り者の将軍"
 SAM_Turncoat_General_desc: "我々の将軍や将校には、ドイツ軍の捕虜だったという過去や、ドイツ軍と協力したいという意思以外の共通点はほとんどない。ある者は、赤軍への憎しみや、現実または想像上の悪い扱いに対する怒りに駆られていた。また、単に捕虜収容所から抜け出すための手段と考えた人もいた。理由が何であれ、そして彼らがどんなに優秀であっても、ロシア国民への反逆行為によって、我々の将軍たちは広く嫌われる存在となっている。"
 SAM_Village_Councils: "農村評議会"
 SAM_Village_Councils_desc: "ロシアの農村は長い間、自主的に統治することを求めてきた。地方レベルでは依然としてコミューンが主要な行政機関である。\n\n農村評議会に軍隊を派遣する制度も整備されている。ゆっくりと、だが着実に、地域社会が駐屯地を略奪的あるいは寄生的な組織として見なすことがなくなりつつある。その一方で、現地の司令官は、割り当てられた地域の平和と繁栄を維持する能力について、ますます厳しく問われるようになっている。"

 SAM_slipped_leash: "鎖からの解放"

 SAM_Our_General_desc: "国民解放軍には理論上、ウラソフを頂点としたヒエラルキーがあり、その下に多数の将校がいる。だが実際には、将校たち全体の意見が我々の活動に重要である。そして将校団と委員会には、セルゲイ・ブニャチェンコという王者がいる。ブニャチェンコは第二次世界大戦中にドイツ軍の捕虜となり、流刑地に送られた。ロシアでは、彼の運命を悲しむ者はほとんどいなかった。戦争初期にいくつかの重要な戦いに敗れたことを、ソ連指導部は広く非難していたからだ。\n\n西ドイツ戦争の暗黒時代、ブニャチェンコは、ロシア民族解放軍に参加して、西ロシア革命戦線を押し返せば、刑期を免れると言われた。ソ連指導部への怒りと牢獄からの脱出を切望していたブニャチェンコは、国家解放軍での昇進を果たした。ブニャチェンコは有能な将校として広く知られており、自分たちの考えを貫くことで部下から慕われている。彼はロシアの統一とソ連残党の殲滅、そして何よりもドイツの滅亡を願っている。"
 SAM_Their_Puppet: "彼らの傀儡"
 SAM_Their_Puppet_desc: "ミハイル・オクタンは、彼の支持者に対しては厳しい人物であり、他者に対しては弱い人物である。彼は15年の間に二度もドイツに敗れた共産主義政権に対しては、ほとんど共感していない。彼は、君主主義者でもなければ、民主主義者でもない。これらの過去の政権の弱さが、ロシアを失敗した共産主義政権の束縛の中に引きずり込んだからである。\n\nドイツはヨーロッパの覇者となった。オクタンとその支持者たちにとって、ベルリンは人間の進歩を妨げてきたあらゆるユダヤ人政権を粉砕したのである。ウラソフと彼の仲間はドイツを目的達成のための手段と見ているかもしれないが、オクタンはもっとよく分かっている。彼はウラソフを、ドイツの影の下から抜け出そうともがく、弱い哀れな男として見ている。\n\nミハイル・オクタンはドイツと協力することに喜びを感じている。彼はソビエト連邦の残骸にドイツの意思を押し付けること以上に大きな目的はないと考えており、その熱心な協力によってモスコーヴィエン国家弁務官区とそれ以外の場所に多くの人脈を築くことができた。ミハイル・オクタンは頑固者かもしれないし、弱者であるかもしれないが、危険であることに間違いはない。サマラでは、彼を通じてドイツの怪物から必要な物資を調達しているのだ。"

 SAM_Take_What_is_There_desc: "会議では、ズィコフと彼の支持者たちが、イデオロギー的な理由と冷徹な実利的な理由の両方から、自分たちの主張を強く示した。\n\n国民への増税は、彼らさらに遠ざけることになる。ロシア解放軍はまだわずかに残っている好意を失うわけにはいかない、というのが彼らの主張だ。また、ドイツの兵器をさらに受け入れることも良い計画とは言えない。我が軍の兵士は、単なるドイツの操り人形ではなく、ロシアの解放者として見られ、知られなければならないからだ。従って、ズィコフによれば、最善かつ困難な道は、今あるものでやりくりすることらしい。これを実行すれば短期的に我らは弱体化するだろう。だが、人々に愛され、解放した人々に受け入れられることは、非常に大きな助けになるはずだ。"
 SAM_Scavenge_for_Vehicles: "車両のための鹵獲"
 SAM_Scavenge_for_Vehicles_desc: "ズィコフは、国民への増税やドイツ軍への補給要求を行わないよう、他の将校団やその諸派を説得したかもしれないが、それでもほとんどすべてのものが目に見えて不足している。最も差し迫った懸念は、減少し続ける自動車である。国内産業があまりなく、輸入能力も限られているため、トラックや装甲車の保有台数は日ごとに減ってゆきつつある。\n\nそこで、我々の兵士を田舎に派遣し、自動車を探させよう。農民が手放したトラクター、森の中に放置された軍用車やトラック、沼地や森に隠れたドイツやソ連の壊れた戦車など、何でもいい。この鉄の収穫は微々たるもので、ほとんどが使い物にならないものだろう。しかし、エンジンブロックや装甲板を集めれば、その分役に立つだろう。"

 SAM_Looking_For_Treasure_desc: "車両の消耗が収まったので、兵士たちは基地に持ち運べるものはなんでも運ぶことに焦点を当てている。忘れられたドイツやソ連の隠した物資、逃亡したり死んだりした農民が残した農場、墜落したドイツ軍機、埋められた皇帝の金塊……\n\n基地に戻されたがらくたの山は、男たちによって選別される。使えそうなものは何でも保管される。残りのうち、金銭的価値のあるものはモスコーヴィエンの国境に向かう輸送隊によって運ばれ、そこで闇商人が何分の一かの価格で買い取ってくれる。捨てられた鳩時計やティーポットを売っても金持ちにはなれないが、闇市で物資と交換できるものは何でも価値があるのだ。\n\n兵士らを激励するため、発見物の価値の15パーセントを直接兵士に渡し、捜索を奨励しよう。無論、民間人からの盗みで蓄えを行なった兵士は射殺される。彼らをこれ以上怒らせないようにこれを行うのであり、老後の資金を増やすために行っているのではない。"
 SAM_Take_What_is_Ours: "獲物は我らのものだ"
 SAM_Take_What_is_Ours_desc: "ブニャチェンコと将校の大部分は、住民への増税をしないというズィコフの考えを否定している。サマラの民衆が平和に暮らしているのに、兵士だけが命をかけて、古ぼけた配給品で生活するのは不公平だ。市民はもっと行政に溶け込んで、公平に扱われなければならない。彼らはロシア人民解放委員会にいち早く解放された幸運の持ち主であり、そのことを自覚すべきなのだ。\n\nブニャチェンコは詳細な国勢調査を計画した。全ての村や集落の人口が分かれば、羊を傷つけずにどの程度まで毛を刈ることができるかを推定することができる。これは大きな仕事であり、兵士のほとんどと、経理の技能を持つ男性全員を使うこととなる。だが、それに見合うだけの報酬があるだろう。"

 SAM_The_People_Provide_desc: "食料の木箱。穀物の袋。弾薬箱。拾ってきたライフル。全部手に入れた！\n\nこの10年間、お金はほとんど使い道がなかったため、多くの人が地元の駐屯地に現物で税金を納めることを選択した。全市民が軍に公正な税金を納めているのを保証するために、全てのステップに軍の会計が設置される。軍隊を養うには十分な税金が必要だが、市民を破滅させるほどの量は必要ないのだ。\n\n貧しい市民の中には、月2回の給料をもらう代わりに軍に時間を割く者もいる。彼らの時間の中心は、銃や弾薬を製造する作業場である。その他に、兵士の食料を供給するために新たに土地を耕す者もいる。また、僅かながら予備役として徴兵され、食料をもらう人もいる。\n\nそんな中、多くの人が増税に文句を言う。しかし、あまり大きな声では言えない。税金取りは、秩序を守る軍隊でもあるからだ。"
 SAM_The_Russian_People_Deliver_Us: "ロシアの人民が我らの下に"
 SAM_The_Russian_People_Deliver_Us_desc: "我々の兵士は、これほどまでに十分な食事と物資を得たことがなかったのだろう。彼らの士気は急上昇し、無法地帯であるロシアの貧困から逃れるために、今では多くの人が我が軍に志願しようとしている。貯蔵庫は満杯となり、料理人は何日もかけて余った穀物を堅パンに調理している。\n\nその一方で、市民たちはこの興奮をあまり分かち合っていない。だが、最も懐疑的な者でさえ、新たに活気付いた軍隊がこれまで以上に努力していることを認めねばならない。路上でのパトロールは頻繁に行われるようになり、山賊行為の取り締まりが強化されている。ひねくれた者は、これは税金取りの競争相手を排除するためだと言うかもしれない。だが、サマラがかつてないほど安全な場所であることは誰もが認めることだ。ロシアの民衆は、彼らを救い出す手段を我らに与えてくれた。近い将来、バルト海から太平洋まで、軍事的な秩序と繁栄が支配することになるだろう。"
 SAM_Take_What_is_Theirs: "獲物は彼らのものだ"
 SAM_Take_What_is_Theirs_desc: "ブニャチェンコとズィコフに対して、オクタンの将校一派とドイツ人「顧問」が立ちはだかった。なぜわざわざ、錆びたソ連製銃器や牛糞にまみれたカブなど、サマラの役立たずな農民が地下に隠しているものを漁るのだ？ロシア人民解放委員会は、世界がかつて見たこともないような偉大な軍事大国へのアクセスに恵まれている。なぜそれを活用しないのだ？ドイツの高品質な武器と物資の輸送は、解放軍にとって欠くことのできないもう一つの利点である。\n\nオクタンの提案はかなりの支持を集めている。ドイツから武器や物資を集めるということは、国民へのさらなる課税を避けるというズィコフの考えにもつながる。ブニャチェンコ一派にとっても、ドイツの武器に新しい弾薬を供給してもらえるというのは、実に魅力的な話である。だが反対派からは、「ドイツに頼るのは長期的には良くない計画だ」「物資をねだり続けるのは見苦しい」と、いろいろな方面からの反論が寄せられてくる。その後ろで、ドイツ人顧問が議論の行方を見守っている。"
 SAM_German_Arms: "ドイツの武器"
 SAM_German_Arms_desc: "ドイツは迅速に、大量の物資を送ってくれた。だがこれだけが、ドイツの援助について言える唯一の点だろう。\n\n兵士たちは、第二次世界大戦時代のKar98kライフルと7.92x57mmモーゼル弾薬の木箱を何日もかけて開梱した。ドイツ軍は、これら時代遅れの武器や弾薬に加え、古くなった食糧も豊富に供給してきた。楽観論者は、西ロシア戦争時のもので、まだ食べられると主張し、悲観論者は、第二次世界大戦の残り物だと主張している。\n\nオクタンとその支持者達は、このことを気にしていないようだ。食べ物は食べ物で、武器は武器なのだ。軍隊というのは規律とリーダーシップで決まる者であり、ロシア解放軍にはその両方がある……少なくとも将校が泣き言を言ったり、消極的でなければそうなるだろう。共産主義者、退廃した民主主義者、アル中の盗賊を排除するために、銃剣より強力なものは必要ないはずだ。"

 SAM_Moskowien_Contacts_desc: "ライヒからの援助は非常に貴重なものだ。だが、まだまだ多くのものをドイツから得られるかもしれない。もちろん、ドイツ政府は忙しいことが多いので、彼らの友人と話をすべきだろう。\n\n国境を越えたところにあるモスコーヴィエンは、AA線以西のロシアを管理するために作られた広大なドイツ行政区である。入植者、軍の駐屯地の者、ロシアの二等市民などからなる荒くれ者達が、軍閥や盗賊の影という厳しい環境の中で生計を立てている。オクタンらロシア人民解放委員会のメンバーは、この一年で、モスコーヴィエンの民兵や軍人と連絡を取り合うようになった。ロシア人民解放委員会は国境の監視に最善を尽くしてきた。ドイツ軍の爆撃が終わりそうな今、ボリシェヴィキのアナキストや盗賊の大群が国境を越えて押し寄せないように、国境の向こうの仲間に電話して、物資を要求してはどうだろうか。"
 SAM_Dealing_with_Dissent: "反対派への対処"
 SAM_Dealing_with_Dissent_desc: "ウラソフやロシア人民解放委員会の目には、我々の解放軍が、すでに「解放」した「国家」の人々の間でさえ、ひどく不人気であることが映っている。\n\n我々が悪化させたかどうか分からない税金の問題は一旦無視するとして、サマラの民衆は我々を外国の手先として軽蔑している。多くの市民、特に左寄りの者達は、我々を西ロシア革命戦線の敗北を招いた反省なき裏切り者と見ている。\n\n将校達の間では、最善の解決策として様々な意見が飛び交っている。そこで、もう一度、参謀本部を開いて、この問題を討議し、民衆の好意を確保するための一つの方策……少なくとも民衆の反発をなくすための方策を決めるのが得策であろう。"
 SAM_The_Smart_Way: "賢明なる道"
 SAM_The_Smart_Way_desc: "不屈の精神を持つズィコフは、登壇の機会を利用して、賢明で正当に市民の生活を向上させようとすることが最善の方法であると主張した。正統性とは、国民の支持によって得られるものであり、兵士は兄弟であり、父親であり、息子である。畑を耕し、銃を造る男たちも、新生ロシアのために戦う兵士たちに劣らず、必要不可欠な存在なのだ。国民全体を我ら目的のために奴隷にすることは、ソ連と第三帝国の過ちと同じである。前者はとっくに死に、後者は自ら死のうとしている。\n\nしかし、それは容易な道ではない。恐怖、疑念、打ち砕かれた希望が、多くの国民を不信に向かわせている。ドイツと協力したことを決して許さない人もいるだろうし、我々の善意を証明するためには多くの努力をしなければならないだろう。新しく解放された地方に圧政の評判が広がらないよう、この問題は今すぐ解決しなければならない。"
 SAM_Hearing_the_People_Out: "人々の声を聴く"
 SAM_Hearing_the_People_Out_desc: "われわれの地域社会への働きかけは、ほとんどの将校が冷笑しているにも関わらず、ある程度の成果を上げている。兵士たちは農村の道路を改修したり、瓦礫の撤去を手伝ったりするようになった。農民は当初、兵士に面倒をかけることに消極的であったが、その後、他の仕事で助けを求めてくれる者も何人かいた。兵士は急ぎの仕事には応じ、その結果、かなりの好意が生まれた。\n\nこれと並行して、民軍混成の裁判も相次いで設立された。兵士や政府から不当な扱いを受けた人々は、裁判官に苦情を申し出ることが奨励されている。兵士を厳しく罰することは問題外であるが（国家の統制を失わないために）、最悪の行き過ぎた行為には罰則を与え、被害を受けた市民が補償されるようにすることは、大きな意味を持つのだ。もうひとつ、徐々に注目を集めているのが、軍民混合の地域協議会という考えで、小さな駐屯地が自分たちの組織を守る村と一体化させるというものだ。長い道のりではあるが、我々の運動を支持し、応援してくれる人たちが現れれば、実現する可能性は十分にある。"
 SAM_The_Easy_Way: "容易き道"
 SAM_The_Easy_Way_desc: "かつてボリシェヴィキのレーニンは、「市民は三度の食事で革命から解放される」と言った。食べ物の不安定と退屈は、おとなしい子羊たちを策略をめぐらす狼に変身させる最良の方法の一つであろう。\n\nブニャチェンコをはじめとする役員会のメンバーは、大量の食料を買い込んで配るという単純な計画を提案した。無政府地帯のロシアでは、飢餓に瀕しているのが普通であり、食料を確保するだけで、積極的な無関心層が生まれる。ズィコフの言う通り、国民は我々の解放計画に協力する必要があるが、彼らの生活を向上させるために労力を費やす価値はない。兵士が国家解放に奔走している間、彼らが満足し、食事ができるように、ただ放置しておけばよい。\n\nもちろん、食料の調達にはお金がかかる。しかし、これから起こる戦争は、多くのチャンスを与えてくれる。戦争が始まれば、我々の金庫はまた満たされるだろう。"
 SAM_Food_for_All: "皆のための食料"
 SAM_Food_for_All_desc: "食料の輸入と購入の安定した供給経路を持つことは、重要なことである。それが平等に分配され、腐敗や損失がないことを確認することは全く別のことだ。\n\nソ連時代から、多くのロシアの後継国と同じように、インフラはメンテナンス不足とテロによる爆撃で、かなり破壊されている。だが、意思さえあれば道もある。すでに全領土に兵士を駐屯させており、その兵士にとにかく補給をしなければならない。我々の広範な物流インフラを利用すれば、どの村や地域も取り残されることはないだろう。そのためには、困難な地形でも徒歩や馬で食料を運ぶ必要がある。国民一人一人に十分な食料が行き渡るようにすることで、平和と静寂を得ることができれば、この闘いは十分に価値のあるものとなるだろう。"
 SAM_The_Hard_Way: "困難な道"
 SAM_The_Hard_Way_desc: "農民を助けることも、農民を養って従わせるのも、農民の意見に価値があることを前提にしている。解放軍は、ボリシェヴィキや山賊から人民を守ることに命を捧げている。我々に叛逆するような恩知らずは、裏切り者と同じだ。\n\nオクタンと一部の強硬派は、反抗的な市民の件を、取り締まりを提案することで片付けた。反抗的な地域社会には軍隊を放てばいい。共産主義者と疑われる者は刑務所にぶち込めばいい。デモは暴力的に取り締まればいい。生死をかけた戦争が、そこにはあるのだ。20世紀の4つの主要な戦争全てで、軟弱さがロシアを攻撃した。強大な熊がミミズの意見を気にするだろうか？解放軍は、残忍なまでの能率で後方を確保するだろう。"

Things are returning to normal, but the devastation caused by many long years of war hampers economic recovery. The task now is to aid development and better extend our reach in newly conquered territories.\n\nWe are unable to return to a peacetime economy at the present, but, if there's any lesson we can take from our former benefactors, it is that military expenditures can do wonders for rapid economic development. Redeploying soldiers across the region will allow us to fill gaps in regional economies, as well as secure our hold over far-flung areas. The ROA liberated the people of West Russia; it should naturally have some involvement in building it up to greatness."
 SAM_Cutting_the_chaff: "Cutting the Chaff"
 SAM_Cutting_the_chaff_desc: "The conditions we found ourselves in during the liberation of West Russia sometimes necessitated a certain lowering of our standards. Many of our conscripts were, to lack a better word, suboptimal. Whether of insufficient quality or insufficient loyalty to the correct faction of the ROA, elements of our forces can not be trusted to maintain the honor, obedience, and fighting spirit that will bring us victory in our future challenges.\n\nTo put it another way, we are long overdue for a purge. Soldiers unable to meet tests of physical fitness or allegiance will be cast out of the army, with jail time for the most serious cases of possible treason. While the diminishing of our numbers always hurts, we are better off in the long run with a loyal and effective fighting force."
 SAM_An_outward_looking_army: "An Outward Looking Army"
 SAM_An_outward_looking_army_desc: "Not too long ago, our army was filled with factionalism, infighting, and corruption. Its ranks were swelled with incompetent and treasonous conscripts and our officer corps was overloaded and politically untrustworthy. Although it was more than sufficient to conquer West Russia, the ROA was not the well-oiled machine needed to reclaim the rest of the country from the despots and criminals occupying it.\n\nWith our recent reforms, that fact has changed. The army is now slimmer and more effective, united behind the political leadership in the name of our cause. It is now time to look out from our own borders, and, as the best-trained, best-led army in all of Russia, take the first steps to total reunification."
 SAM_Gun_smithing_program: "Gun Smithing Program"
 SAM_Gun_smithing_program_desc: "The warlord armies of West Russia only scarcely had modern equipment to rely on. In most of the battles we fought on our way to regional hegemony, both sides were primarily equipped with surplus weapons from the Great Patriotic War, with even ten-year-old hardware being somewhat of a luxury. This will not suffice in our future battles; the enemies we have ahead of us will be larger, better-equipped, and more industrially formidable than our comparably meager previous foes.\n\nThe prospect of a serious disparity in equipment quality between us and our rivals is disconcerting enough to warrant immediate action. The ROA desperately needs modern guns, and a manufacturing drive across our entire territory should get us to where we need to be. Anything less would relegate our soldiers to battlefield inferiority in the coming days."
 SAM_A_Modern_air_force: "A Modern Air Force"
 SAM_A_Modern_air_force_desc: "Since the downfall of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the vast majority of Russia's battles have been fought on the ground. Most of the scattered warlord states left behind had neither the funds nor the equipment to maintain a large air force. Our ground superiority allowed us to bulldoze our way through Russia, but this tactical state of affairs will not last. Our future opponents will be larger, more modern states, easily capable of fielding jet fighters and bombers.\n\nThe ROA needs to react with the utmost speed to these changing circumstances and create a new air force. With the productive capacity of West Russia's factories behind us, building planes is finally within our grasp. Subjugating our eastern rivals will require taking to the skies, and the ROA's best are well up to that task."
 SAM_Getting_our_toes_wet: "Getting Our Toes Wet"
 SAM_Getting_our_toes_wet_desc: "Unlike with our nascent air force, building a strong navy is a relatively mild concern, at least for now. The reunification wars ahead of us will be fought almost entirely on or over solid ground. Still, it would be prudent to create a small navy, both to police the waters we do border and to set up a framework for after we achieve total unification, at which time a large navy would be necessary.\n\nRefitting several ships from the Soviet era for the present era should do, at least for now. For leadership, we shouldn't spare anyone vital; this is not a serious priority at the moment, but few would turn down the chance to be the first admiral of the new Russia. We may be starting small, but our successors will surely appreciate our foresight for beginning to establish the navy now."

 SAM_Mechanization_of_the_ROA_desc: "The WRW and the Anarchy saw our men carry kilos and kilos of equipment into and out of conflict zones. Wounded comrades were often abandoned, as our men were unable to carry them quickly enough to field hospitals. Strong points were nightmares to capture, as light infantry was exposed to artillery and machine gun fire.\n\nMechanization is the principle that sees our men rely on an ever expanding fleet of motorized and armored vehicles. Vehicles that are able to transport them to battle, to support them during offensives and shield them during firefights. It will be a costly process, and one that may not be completed for years. Yet any amount of armor and speed will be a great force multiplier."

Every year there are new weapons to equip our soldiers with, new training methods that better prepare the men for combat, new tactics that will provide the crucial edge on the battlefield. If this were not enough to keep track of, each of these new developments is supposed to work in conjunction with one another. We have managed to keep our men equipped with modern weapons and trained to modern standards. Our generals are keeping up to date with the latest developments in strategic thought. However, our army still feels somewhat discordant.\n\nOur officers must know how they can use modern tanks and IFVs in their maneuvers most effectively. The men must be trained with modern rifles and anti-tank equipment. It is not enough for the military to be well equipped or well led. Every part must move together in harmony. Only then will we have a modern, professional military fit for a nation, not a warlord."

This provides us with a chance to start fresh, and create a new economy that is fine-tuned to serve our purposes. In the short term at least that will involve a focus on rapidly increasing military production as we prepare for the looming conflicts to our east and west. Each and every citizen will do their part to build a new, stronger Russia. When the next war comes to the Motherland we will not need to transition to a war economy.

The red army remnants have been crushed and thrown to the dustbin of history. The tsarist mummies have joined the reds in this fate.

The ROA has evolved from the band of unmotivated conscripts it once was. It is now a fully modernized, vicious fighting force ready for modern conflict against industrialized opponents. Russia's new army will be the spear we use to skewer the traitors and bandits to our east. Some in the government question if we have placed too much emphasis on developing the military at the expense of other areas. They say the Russian economy is not yet developed enough to support such a large and advanced army. Perhaps they are right, but it is unimportant. Russia will be reunified, and it will be the nation with the best army that reunites it. We will make sure that is us."

West Russia is the most prosperous and orderly it has been in at least ten years, and the size and influence of the ROA is a signal to foreigners that we mean business. That said, our potential partners are understandably somewhat cagey. Russia has been isolated for enough time that few international leaders know quite what to expect.\n\nTo start off, we can reassure them that we are open for a warm and mutually beneficial relationship with any power willing to support us. Allowing observers into the ROA, while not much, will lay the groundwork for further military cooperation. Should we show the Americans that our love for freedom matches theirs? Should we show the Japanese that we too have a healthy respect for order and a fierce loathing of communism? Decisions, decisions..."

A scrap of paper as it may be, the Smolensk Declaration has been the start of our glorious campaign to free Russia from her enemies.\n\nA new declaration has been issued in Samara, where our men broke free from German servility.

In practice few people dare invest in an untested nation that has just emerged from a violent set of civil wars, with an uncertain future.

It is hard to make a profit when your potential customers are fighting for their lives and focused on not starving. But now that we have restored a measure of stability to our corner of Russia we may be able to attract some investment from overseas. Corporations from Italy, America, and Japan might be persuaded to at least look into expanding their operations into Russia. The promise of a government that is friendly to capitalism and eager to establish economic ties with the outside world just might be enough to get them to overlook the dangers of investing in an ongoing warzone."

 SAM_contacts_with_moskowien_bunyachenko_desc: "It is no secret that the situation in Reichskommissariat Moskowien is unstable, and that is putting it mildly. The German efforts to settle the territory have proven insufficient to out-populate the native Russians, who have been forced to live as an oppressed majority in their former homeland. The Germans want less Russians in Mosowien and the Russians don't want to be ruled by the Germans. There is a solution that benefits both parties, but more importantly it benefits us most of all. Using our contacts in Moskowien, we can create an immigration program that will resettle tens of thousands of Russians from the Reichskommissariat to within our borders. This immigration will greatly increase our population and bring fresh recruits for the army straight to our doorstep."

We must take the initiative and define ourselves before our enemies can slander us in the eyes of the great powers. The Provisional Commissariat of Western Russia shall be known as a beacon of law and order in a chaotic world. We will lead by example, standing against the evils of communism and Nazism and defending the stability of our region. All across the globe, nations shall look upon Russia and know that it can be counted on to do what is right. We will reclaim the Motherland's status as a bulwark against anarchy!"

This does not mean that we should resign ourselves to this fate.\n\nWe've already established contact with the intelligence community in a number of country. By now inviting a range of NGOs and civilian officials, we can show the world we have nothing to hide. This way we can begin to grow a new narrative, one of a burgeoning democracy in Western Russia.\n\nOf course, nothing must be left to chance, and so the sights shown to our visitors will be carefully arranged. Honesty is like sugar in coffee; having too much of it can turn a sweet thing to undrinkable sludge."

This, Chairman Zykov assures us, can be played to our advantage.\n\nThe Wehrmacht has long maintained a strictly militarized border with the Russian warlord states. These garrisons served the double purpose of keeping warlords out and Russians second class citizens in. Now, the changing situation in Moskowien and in Germany has blown big holes in the border, and our Russian brothers look hesitantly to the east. If we reassure them that a safe and strong Russia is on the rise here, our brethren might start making the trip east.\n\nSuch a migration would increase our population, and earn Chairman Zykov more devoted supporters. The Germans are likely to chafe at the indignity of seeing their slaves run free, but what can they do about it?"

While this has previously benefited Oktan and those he chose to bestow his gifts upon in exchange for favors and loyalty, it's time for these smugglers to benefit all of Russia!\n\nOktan will talk to those that he has bought east of the Urals to see if they, or anyone that they know who is anyone of anywhere would be willing to play for the ROA's team. The Grand Marshal, of course, has ensured that anyone who is willing to cooperate with the Committee will be handsomely rewarded - considering how well he has treated his officers thus far, we can expect that many will be tempted by his offer."

A scrap of paper as it may be, the Smolensk Declaration has been the start of our glorious campaign to free Russia from her enemies.\n\nA new declaration has been issued in Samara, where our men broke free from German servility. This new document will paper over our controversial history and present anew the ROA as the organism of liberation and unification of all of Russia. The declaration will equally denounce foreign interference in Russian affairs, and warn the world of our resolve for a strong and independent motherland."

Any man worth his grain of salt and his mother knows that you can't simply stash money under the proverbial mattress - especially if the sheer volume of it comes anywhere close to what Oktan's been bringing in ever since he assumed control. Some of the Grand Marshal's more economically-minded friends have suggested a two-pronged method of dealing with what Oktan calls \"suffering from success\".\n\nAnonymous bank accounts in the names of dead ROA officers or fabricated individuals will be created in Russian banks and slush funds will be sought abroad to help secure retirement money for the most honored of Russia's heroes, Oktan included of course, as well as to help pool foreign investments and keep the money in the hands of those wise enough to use it correctly."

Despite their entropic slide into disarray, the Germans are still a power to be feared - and respected.\n\nHowever, more importantly, we need to make sure that the very, very long list of favors that Mikhail Oktan has earned from the Fritzes and Hanses of Germany need to be accounted for and \"cashed in\", so to speak, before the Germans refuse to cooperate with us entirely. We'll start with the most wishy-washy and the ones who have the most to lose, working our way down to the most corrupt border guard; whatever happens, we'll take whatever they're offering and more.

The Americans are certainly no fools - at least, their politicians aren't. But the bleeding-hearts behind western charities intent on alleviating poverty certainly don't. The Grand Marshal has ordered the creation of an organization, officially not associated with his government. The Organizatsiya po Bezopasnosti Russkogo Narodna, or OBRN, in English the Organization for the Security of the Russian people is what it will be called.\n\nOktan has announced to the people that through this organization, \"food and books for all of Russia\" will be made available. While this may be true, it's certainly not the intent of the NGO - not only will foreign aid come through the OBRN and mysteriously disappear, it's a perfect front for the money laundering needs of some of Oktan's friends."

By using his contacts in Moskowien, Oktan has managed to encourage a number of people, refugees, patriots, or otherwise to abandon the Reichskommissariat in favour of the land controlled by the Committee. Not only will this bolster the available manpower for our factories and our armies, which seem to be growing by the day, the mass migrations of these refugees will seriously disrupt the Germans and their ability to control the so-called \"porous border\" between us and their easternmost Reichskommissariat."

Back when Mikhail Oktan and his allies were etching out a meager existence around the city of Samara, a lot of the now-grand marshal's \"friends\" enjoyed impartial and unbalanced agreements with Oktan, who tolerated these arrangements only because he had little choice in the matter.\n\nNow, however, with the might of Western Russia behind him and the rapidly-recovering industrial power that has shown itself to come with the territory, Oktan is now in a position to renegotiate his prior arrangements. New business relationships are important, but the best of the best will only be offered to those who are willing to give and take."

Oktan has sought out mercenaries all around the globe, encouraging them to come and work for him and him only. These mercenaries, kept loyal by Oktan's seemingly bottomless pockets, will not only serve as a personal bodyguard to the grand marshal, but will also do the wetwork that Oktan deems either inappropriate or otherwise too important for his Russian subordinates to see through.\n\nAfter all, Oktan's political rivals won't liquidate themselves.

Homelessness has always been endemic to the Russian anarchy, and our new economy threatens to render many more men and women homeless as we clamp down on unemployment and squatting.\n\nWhile we've no patience for freeloaders, a token social net would not go amiss to continue stabilizing public opinion for our government.

The origin of our own government in particular is a complicated subject. The fact that the ROA was created to collaborate with the Nazis makes it easy to mistake it for an army of traitors. The students of Russia must be kept away from this seductive lie. We will teach them the truth, that President Bunyachenko did what was necessary to rid Russia of the Bolshevik menace and created an army of true patriots who fought for the freedom of all Russians.

We will allow for the formation of opposition parties that can receive representation in the controlled lower house of parliament.

Many of these men have fought constantly for decades, first under the brutal yoke of the communists and then in the armies of the warlords that rose to power in the collapse. We can never repay the debt we owe to the men who made everything we have accomplished possible, but we must try. If even a single veteran wonders how he will afford his rent or pay for his next meal we have failed. Their pensions must be increased, so they do not have to work in their old age. Programs to provide homes for them must be created, so they are not forced to sleep in the streets of the nation they risked their lives for.

This resurgence has been powered by a collaboration between the people and the government. The labourers of Russia work long hours, often in unpleasant conditions and for little pay, but they know their efforts are rewarded in other ways. The government cares for the people, providing welfare and assistance to those who need it and ensuring every Russian is doing their part to rebuild the Motherland.

New military officers were always needed, as well as new engineers and doctors.\n\nThis spirit of national resilience has left us with many instructed professionals that can now be put to good use.

The people have faith in the strength of their government, knowing that we have their interests at heart and will fight to defend their freedom.

The grand marshal has instituted what he refers to as a \"nationwide talent drive\" to bring all of those who may have some academic or scientific value to his provisional capital.\n\nWhile this has earned some degree of ire from a number of our subordinates in the more distant or developed provinces, it will ensure the primacy of the grand marshal's influence within Russian sciences, technology, and progress. All Russians shall follow the example that is put forward by the intelligentsia gathered through Oktan's talent drive!"

However, the Grand Marshal made it so that each fief given out was approximately the same size as the others.\n\nWhile this means that each one is a fair parcel of land, it also means that by necessity, there's a whole bunch of them that were parcelled out. Because of how fragmented these territories have become, we need to have a bureaucracy dedicated only to managing and keeping track of them all. This will be Oktan's Ministry of the Interior - a bureaucratic masterpiece meant to prevent competition and discord between the statelets."

In East Asia, it's the drive for profit. The Germans' love to hate. Here, in Russia, it needs to be the love of Russia and hatred for the German.\n\nNo self-respecting Russian can live their life without knowing their enemy to the west. That's what we'll tell them, at least. By flaming the fires of nationalism and leaning the people towards and into the love of Russia and her savior Mikhail Oktan, the masses will not only be controlled by the ROA, but will be used by the ROA."

 SAM_expand_the_committee_of_national_liberation_desc: "The Grand Marshal has brought up a good point - the general apolitical nature of the Committee has lead to the detachment of the officers who rule the nation and those that they rule over. This will not do, he has stipulated.\n\nDuring his long tenure among the Nazis, Oktan has learned much about the importance of merging political and military apparatuses. Thus, the Grand Marshal has gone about assigning the task of transforming the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia into a truly political party that will ultimately be a very, very long arm of Mikhail Oktan.\n\nLocal branches of the KONR will be established in towns and cities, membership will be encouraged, and the tenets of anti-Bolshevism and support of the Grand Marshal will be instilled in all those who join. Mandatory youth groups will also be established, to train Russia's young as the next generation of soldiers - to have perfect discipline and many years of soldiering experience before even entering the army."

 SAM_bread_on_the_table_desc: "The establishment of Moskowien cut a sizable quantity of Russia's arable land away from its free population. This, combined with the breakdown of trade within the territory of the former Soviet Union, has made food insecurity endemic. We were lucky to possess at least some of the remaining arable land during our stay in Samara; now that we control all of Western Russia, many of our new territories have spent a decade teetering on the brink of famine. Chief among them are the lands of the fallen WRRF, near Arkhangelsk.\n\nIn the longer term we can expect shifts in population as regions in the south of our nation see internal migration. In the meantime, we must tend to the matter of food security. Ensuring stable access to basic stables such as bread will do much to legitimize our state among our new subjects."

Freed from the German bombings and from the sclerotic economy of the Bolsheviks, Russian hard work and ingenuity has been set free. This does not mean, however, that the private sector will be left free to run entirely unrestricted. Several important sectors of the economy such as weapons development and energy production could do well as either state-run businesses or public-private partnerships.

Simple amenities that even the incompetent Soviets could provide became scarce luxuries in the two decades of anarchy Russia endured. Now that we have consolidated our rule over Western Russia, we can begin importing some of these goods once more. Jam and tea, honey and wine, silk and jewelry. All of these and many more will soon return to Russia, but not for just anyone. Only those who have proven themselves to be of use to us will be able to buy them. It is only right that those who have saved Russia be rewarded, and if there is a chance to profit off of the rewards we would be foolish not to take it."

 SAM_import_substitution_desc: "Attracting foreign business is important to growing the Russian economy and reintegrating our nation into the global marketplace, but we must not grow reliant upon corporations based in New York or Tokyo. If they had it their way, the corporate giants of the world would transform Russia into one giant consumer, a country where everything can be bought and nothing can be produced. This cannot be allowed to happen. To safeguard against foreign exploitation we should work with the Kombinats to increase domestic production while reducing imports of finished products wherever possible. There is nothing wrong with buying American steel and Japanese rubber, as long as we can decide what is built."

We will make sure that this can never happen again by setting regulations for each sector of our economy to protect both the workers and the companies. The government shall serve as the arbiter of all labor disputes, but we will also make these disputes less frequent. By establishing uniform salaries for positions in every industry and founding state-run unions to represent the interests of employees we can defend both the rights of the entrepreneur and the dignity of the worker. With the unions under our control we will be able to protect our workers from exposure to the radical left-wing ideologies that so easily infect private unions."
 SAM_labor_police: "Labor Police"
 SAM_labor_police_desc: "Within every union are communist traitors who scheme and plot, subtly spreading their poisonous doctrine among the workers and planning for the downfall of Russia. We must be ever vigilant against this threat, for it has already brought the Motherland low once. A new internal security service should be created, tasked with monitoring the workers of Russia, especially those who are involved in labor unions. These labor police will work in the open and under cover, on the factory floor and in the back room where plotters meet. The only way to separate the socialist agents from the honest laborers they try to deceive is with constant oversight. The worker's best friend is not the organizer, but the government officer that tails him."
 SAM_bread_or_stick: "Bread or Stick"
 SAM_bread_or_stick_desc: "Russia has been brough low by decades of civil war, German terrorism and Soviet mismanagement. There is so much to be done, and so many missing working age men.\n\nThere are endless opportunities for advancement for citizens willing to work hard. The rebuilding of the Motherland offers bountiful work, and for those who show initiative a life of plenty awaits. Our state will give back to those who give without reservation to their nation. On the flip side, those that shall spurn the duties and rewards of rebuilding the state will receive no mercy. Our work bringing labor unions into line has shown that we will not tolerate trouble makers. Workers who continue to persevere in their attempt to subvert the state will be punished. Integrating police element within key industrial sectors will ensure we always have eyes and ears on the ground.\n\nPresident Bunyachenko and the Army of National Liberation have fought hard for Russian citizens to be given the opportunities of this age of rebuilding. Those who spurn the chance to earn their bread through dutiful work will receive the stick. The nation has no patience for lay-abouts and disobedient citizens."
 SAM_a_national_bank: "A National Bank"
 SAM_a_national_bank_desc: "The Kombinats have been highly successful, and their success has brought prosperity to Russia. Supporting their growth has proven to be a wise decision, but now some of the owners are beginning to chafe under our guidance. The Kombinats cannot be allowed to grow too independent of our rule, and the best way to maintain their dependence on the government is through a method known as \"window guidance\". Window guidance is a technique mastered by the Japanese central bank that involves encouraging bank investment in companies that comply with the government's advice. By creating a new national bank of Russia we will centralize our state's financial power and consolidate control over Russia's most powerful corporations."
 SAM_the_future_can_begin: "The Future Can Begin"
 SAM_the_future_can_begin_desc: "For Europe, the Industrial Revolution came to an end in the early 20th century, but for Russia it has been an ongoing struggle. Both the Tsars and the Soviets invested massive amounts of time and resources into attempting to industrialize an agrarian nation. Sometimes they succeeded, but more often their efforts stalled, accomplishing little. We have managed to succeed where they failed. Under our control Western Russia has finally industrialized, joining the rest of the civilized world at long last.\n\nEvery day millions of Russians go to work in thousands of factories from Arkhangelsk to Samara. Russian business empires are beginning to make a name for themselves not just in Russia but around the world. Steel mills turn out record amounts of material that will be used to build everything from tanks to skyscrapers. Russia has finally escaped the past, and now the future awaits."
 SAM_legal_unions: "Legal Unions"
 SAM_legal_unions_desc: "Workers are the building block of our nation's strength, just as soldiers are the basis of its defense. Like the soldiers of the ROA, the workers of Russia deserve protection and good standards of life.\n\nUnfortunately in the past this protection was mixed in dangerous Socialist nonsense that pitted workers against the rest of the nation and brought great calamity to the Russian people.\n\nThroughout the industrial sector, legal unions are being prepared to give the workers a voice. These unions will be monitored for any sign of socialist infiltration, and all non-legal unions will be squashed. The Soviets have tried to smother the light of liberty in Russia, and we shall never again give them anywhere to spread their vile ideology!"
 SAM_small_and_medium_enterprises: "Small and Medium Enterprises"
 SAM_small_and_medium_enterprises_desc: "Many of our industrial programs have so far targeted big state led factories. However, the true lifeblood of our economy is the humble citizen businessmen. Without a vast ecosystem of small and medium enterprises, our vast government arsenals would be unable to produce the quantity of war material necessary. On top of this crucial purpose, small and medium enterprises give work and purpose to members of the community.\n\nUnfortunately Russia is a difficult place for businessmen. Failing to repay loans can lead to death or injury. Theft and intimidation rackets are rife in many poorly policed areas, burdening entrepreneurs. It is the state's duty to step in and give SMEs the proper environment to thrive by removing pollutants and toxins from the business ecosystem!"
 SAM_proper_land_grants: "Proper Land Grants"
 SAM_proper_land_grants_desc: "The last fifty years have not been kind to the humble Russian peasants. Freed from tsarist despotism, they found themselves under the boot of Soviet oppression before the damned Germans brought an end to central authority. The warlord states that followed were scarcely more concerned for these all importants creator of food and safety.\n\nNow many peasants do not have any legal title to their land, as successive administrations ended in chaos. Others have many conflicting land claims, leaving them masters of either too little or too much land. It is time for us to step in.\n\nA land commission will make sure every ancestral right is respected, and that no village lacks for land under their legal control. This will help restore order and confidence to the countryside."
 SAM_end_internal_controls: "End Internal Controls"
 SAM_end_internal_controls_desc: "We've eased wartime restrictions as much as possible. However there still remains some controls on movement, to avoid people leaving war affected areas en masse to find work elsewhere.\n\nNow that the economy is humming along, we can ease on these travel restrictions. We hope that with abundant work near their home, our citizens will think twice before moving... But it is not becoming of a state to tell them explicitly where to go and when."
 SAM_land_reforms: "Land Reforms"
 SAM_land_reforms_desc: "Now that we've verified who owns what, it appears that a lot of work remains to be done. A lot of the land under legal control has been rendered useless by war. What's more, other peasants are simply refugees from Moskowien or from elsewhere in Russia and they have no village to vouch for their request for land.\n\nThus, our land distribution commission has had its task expanded. We shall break up large farms owned by absentee landlords and redistribute them to landless peasants. In this we will be helped by the large amount of land we confiscated from tsarists, communists and other enemies of the people."
 SAM_a_moral_economy: "A Moral Economy"
 SAM_a_moral_economy_desc: "In speeches after speeches, our chairman has hammered the point that there is no purpose to a strong economy if it doesn't serve the population. Thus, we have endeavored to create a naton that is respectful of its workers, peasants, industrialists and intellectuals. We can now put the finishing touches to our great and moral economy.\n\nGiven the means to take care of their future, and their family's, by the state, the Russian population finally begins to see the ROA and its chairman as leaders and builders rather than as foreign stooges. What we have done in Samara we have replicated throughout Western Russia: we have united our people into one through the power of labor!"
 SAM_eminent_domain: "Eminent Domain"
 SAM_eminent_domain_desc: "It turns out that the infrastructure projects that we had originally laid down to better connect our nation with itself and the outside world have cost a lot more than what we had originally projected. A lot of the land we had our eyes on is owned by powerful people unwilling to part with it. Good thing we're the government.\n\nThrough the use of bribes and pay-offs, and no small application of intimidation and force, we can ensure that the land that we need to secure for our projects will be made freely available to us. The concept of eminent domain has long been used in Europe and abroad when the government needed to make way for progress. Why don't we reintroduce eminent domain in Russia, at the very least to make official and legitimize our \"process\" of securing the land that we need."
 SAM_the_proper_channels: "The Proper Channels"
 SAM_the_proper_channels_desc: "When giving out the governorates to his subordinates, the Grand Marshal was careful to keep a number of the key places remain under his direct control - key ports and railroads, all of which are key for trade, export, and import, lay directly under his administration.\n\nThis has proven to be incredibly useful in propelling the Grand Marshal into a further position of power among the ROA and the generals who he has since granted governmental powers to. Not only does this mean that almost all of what's leaving the country has to go through his hands, but anything that's coming in as well - large amounts of money are not only going to the federal treasury, but to Oktan's pockets specifically, which he will use for what he sees fit."
 SAM_internal_border_control_streamlining: "Internal Border Control Streamlining"
 SAM_internal_border_control_streamlining_desc: "The fact that a number of our military governors have begun closing their borders to one another and imposing tariffs on the import of goods from other governorates has begun to stem the growth of our economy a bit. The Grand Marshal has already begun to brainstorm how to prevent this from hurting us further - we need to smooth out these economic wrinkles to continue to boost the economy as well as grow our industry.\n\nOktan has planned to hire a group of advisors and strongmen that he's already begun to call his \"Internal Border Control\" - these mercenaries and bureaucrats will help streamline the exchange of goods between governorships as well as ensure that everyone is behaving as they should."
 SAM_end_laziness: "End Laziness"
 SAM_end_laziness_desc: "Oktan's scheme to get a number of refugees to flee from the German-controlled areas to our west was successful. Too successful. Now we have dozens of camps that contain thousands of refugees who have little more than the clothes on their back - no homes, no food... no use. We have too many refugees. They haven't done a single thing since they crossed over either - clearly their time with Fritz has made them lazy.\n\nThey need to work in the factories, they need to work for our administration, join the army or produce food. For God's sake, they need to find SOMETHING to do - we can barely afford to distribute food and wealth to our army and continue to have a functioning civilian sector, let alone spare anything for them... especially if they're not interested in doing anything for us. A man's work is his pride, and these refugees are clearly comfortable in their shame. We can't let this go on."
 SAM_corporate_exclaves: "Corporate Exclaves"
 SAM_corporate_exclaves_desc: "We have already witnessed a number of foreign corporations from around the world express interest and even go so far as to invest into our economy. This is awesome - even the preliminary interest and investment has caused a surge of confidence among the markets and the people. The Grand Marshal has laid out a plan - with the assistance of his closest economic advisors, of course - to help encourage these foreign firms to make landfall in Russia.\n\nOktan has proposed that a number of special economic zones, both delineated by geographical range as well as market niches, be created and maintained by the federal government. This will not only help embolden the corporations in making roots in Russia, but it will also help jumpstart the economy that we've been struggling with for so long."
 SAM_everyone_back_to_work: "Everyone's Back to Work!"
 SAM_everyone_back_to_work_desc: "With our efforts to kick the economy back into motion a success, it is time to sit back and reap the rewards. Our factories have roared to life as never before, with a stream of goods flowing to the markets within our territory. And now that the economy is strengthened, it falls to those who made it so to skim a little off the top. After all entrepreneurship and foresight must have its reward, and Mikhail Oktan himself will be the first to choose a slice of the pie."
 SAM_zykov_new_territories: "The New Territories"
 SAM_zykov_new_territories_desc: "Our struggle for the land east of the Urals wasn't an easy one, but we're the clear victor, and now our administration spans from German-occupied Russia's borders in the West to points well beyond the impressive Ural Mountains. But just because we won the battle doesn't mean that we've won the peace: much work must still be done to ensure that we win the hearts and minds of our new populations over.\n\nIt's time to prepare our new land for its integration into our fledgling democratic system. Already, Zykov's agents and administrators have been making inroads in Western Siberia, setting up polling stations and educational areas to prepare the long-oppressed people of Siberia for the onset of democracy, even if it isn't a perfect one. Yet."
 SAM_zykov_partial_elections_for_the_east: "Partial Elections for the East"
 SAM_zykov_partial_elections_for_the_east_desc: "While democracy is coming to Siberia, it's still a fledgling, fragile democracy, and thus we should make sure that the people know how important it is to be voting for the right parties. We've already selected a number of our candidates from west of the Urals to cross the mountains and run as candidates there, but it's also a good idea to make sure that we find some local individuals who would be willing to work as members of our Yedinstvo party.\n\nRunning our own candidates and selecting local affiliates is far from the only thing that we should do to make sure that Siberia is firmly under our control - as the voice of the people, of course. Certain measures should be taken to make sure that Yedinstvo is not just an established, but the preeminent, party. Gerrymandering, in some form, will ensure that Zykov's representatives will remain the ascendant democratic force even far beyond the Urals."
 SAM_zykov_backroom_deals: "Backroom Deals"
 SAM_zykov_backroom_deals_desc: "Our own candidates aren't the only democrats in Siberia. When we liberated the area from our rivals, we were approached by a number of prominent individuals and their supporters in the hopes that we would help establish a functioning democracy in the region. This, of course, is something that we plan to do - eventually - and these individuals will be able to help us do it.\n\nWe'll need to make sure that these individuals, who are businessmen, local politicians, and ex-military men are on our side and members of the Yedinstvo, no matter the cost. Some of these men have already indicated that perhaps certain \"deals\" could be worked out between Zykov's administration in Samara and themselves: loyalty for a price."
 SAM_zykov_preparing_the_elections: "Preparing the Elections"
 SAM_zykov_preparing_the_elections_desc: "Regardless of how we plan on approaching the democratic question in Siberia, there does need to be some cursory preparation for the actual elections themselves. For years, the people in this region have suffered under tyrants and dictators, let alone, before that, the Soviet system. Almost none of the people in our newly acquired territories remember, let alone understand, the importance of democracy.\n\nThus, a lot of work must be done to ensure that our new territory is properly prepared for the coming elections. People must be made aware of voting - how to do it, where and when, and, perhaps most importantly: why. Furthermore, we have to look at the administrative side of things, creating voting districts, hiring administrators and bureaucrats to ensure that votes are collected, tallied, and reported on correctly."

 SAM_zykov_let_the_easterner_run_desc: "Despite what the army may want, Zykov is still the man in charge - and the chairman envisions a functioning democracy for all Russians. Ultimately, our new citizens are still just that: citizens of our republic. And thus, they should be treated as such.\n\nOf course, we will encourage as many people as possible to join and vote for Yedinstvo, but at the end of the day, no free nation forces its people to support a party that they're not invested in. The people should be given a choice - a real choice - to determine their future. This will ensure that our young and fragile democracy inspires real hope among the people."
 SAM_zykov_under_restraints: "...Under Restraints"
 SAM_zykov_under_restraints_desc: "Of course, while it's always important to ensure that the people have a real voice and a right to self-determination, it's risky for us to completely allow the Russians of Siberia - with the weight of years of tyranny and oppression weighing on their shoulders - to vote wantonly for anyone that may rouse populist whims, filling the people's heads with sweet nothings.\n\nEven if we are to allow free and unadulterated election results in most of the East, there may be need to... work some things out. A district reshuffling here, and a small transfer of money there will ensure that the Yedinstvo will have an actual presence in the places where they need to."

 SAM_zykov_from_chairman_to_president_desc: "Miletiy Zykov, former chairman of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, abbreviated as KONR in Cyrillic, has set in motion his ultimate design: the complete dismantlement of KONR and the ultimate transition from his role as chairman of the committee to the President of the new Russian Republic.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he has not only won, but swept the first free elections in Russia in decades. Now that he is serving in an official capacity as the civilian head of state for the Russian Republic, and as Russia has now been liberated, there is little need for the KONR anymore - they have achieved their stated goal. Of course, the actual abolition of KONR may be a little more difficult than signing a piece of legislature: the organization is thick with bureaucratic red tape, and has its tendrils in every part of the new republic's administration."
 SAM_zykov_consolidating_business: "Consolidating Business"
 SAM_zykov_consolidating_business_desc: "One of the surprising products of Russia's warlord era was the beginning and expansion of a number of businesses and corporations across Siberia and the Far East, operating in legal capacities or otherwise. Ever since our victories in the wars of unification, a lot of these businesses have been in legal limbo, some still operating while others are frozen for various reasons.\n\nWe should make a list of the businesses that have since emerged following the collapse of the Union and figure out which should be brought into the public sector of our burgeoning governmental sector, which should be encouraged to rejoin the now-official private sector of our economy, or simply be shut down entirely."

 SAM_zykov_assessing_the_army_desc: "Despite the official dissolution of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, the army that has brought us victory thus far, and has since been integrated as the official Armed Forces of the Republic, does need its fair share of attention - Zykov remembers the loyal officers who helped make his vision a reality.\n\nThe President of the republic has ordered that a commission be set up to examine and assess the status of the republic's army, and figure out if and where more attention, funding, training, or otherwise, needs to be paid to our boys; Zykov knows full well that the army got him this far, and doesn't intend on losing their support any time soon."
 SAM_zykov_improving_the_unity_party: "Improving the Unity Party"
 SAM_zykov_improving_the_unity_party_desc: "Truthfully, the Unity Party, or Yedinstvo in Russian, is a mish-mash of ideologies primarily united by those associated with the former Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, those who were loyal to Zykov, and local prominent individuals who have been bought to help \"manage\" the republic's growth. Sometimes it feels as if the Unity Party is not a party at all, instead a voting bloc of various interest groups!\n\nTo ensure that the Unity Party remains united, the chairman has decided to trim the party's fat, so to speak, by smoothing over the reconcilable differences, removing some of the more troublesome party members, and reinforcing his hegemony over the party. This way, Zykov will make sure that Yedinstvo will stay the dominant party, guided by an actual vision - Zykov's vision."
 SAM_zykov_new_partners_in_the_east: "New Partners in the East"
 SAM_zykov_new_partners_in_the_east_desc: "Some of Milety Zykov's most powerful allies were the various powerful and influential businessmen in Western Russia and the Urals. Not only did they fund him in return for what they believed would end up as a beneficial partnership between them, they also actively worked with the now-President to make sure that the Russian economy would be, in time, rapidly revitalized.\n\nOf course, while the Eastern half of Russia is much more sparse in terms of people, let alone wealthy businessmen, they certainly still exist. We should scour our new territories to find anyone who would be able to forge similar connections with the President and the party in return for their local support for Zykov's agenda."
 SAM_zykov_military_business_oversight: "Military Business Oversight"
 SAM_zykov_military_business_oversight_desc: "Long has the distinction between military officer and CEO been blurred for many members of the Russian Liberation Army, who have, for years, been both serving in the capacity of commissioned officers within our armed forces and leaders of businesses. This has come to be known as \"military business oversight\". For some time, this worked when the Russian Liberation Army was eking out an existence in the city of Samara, barely being able to hold its own against raiders, bandits, and German bombs. However, Zykov has done his best to ensure that this system, well-entrenched in parts of Western Russia, doesn't expand any further.\n\nDespite all best efforts, certain reports point to the further expansion of this system east of the Urals - a development that has alarmed the President and his supporters. Zykov has called for an immediate covert investigation into the expansion of this so-called \"oversight\". Whether or not he feels as if he can control it, or if he'll move to stem its growth is yet to be seen."
 SAM_zykov_democratic_officers: "Democratic Officers"
 SAM_zykov_democratic_officers_desc: "While the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia was, formally, entirely subservient to Zykov, the reality of the situation was much more complex, with a lot of more reactionary and troublesome individuals more interested in more authoritarian ways of governing... or worse. Truthfully, the old guard of the Russian Liberation Army and KONR have long been a thorn in the President's side, especially as they continue to grumble about Zykov's increasingly democratic vision.\n\nIt's time for this old guard to be put out to pasture. They've served long, and they've served hard, and it's for these exact reasons that these officers - well used to having a very present opinion in politics, should be replaced with a new generation of officers - free from the stains of collaboration and corruption, fresh faces, local faces, to help begin the process of depoliticizing the army."

 SAM_zykov_investing_in_talent_desc: "The future of Russia is in the hands of the youth! As such, the youth deserve the best we can possibly offer, especially in terms of education. The President has decreed today that schools, be they primary, secondary, or post-secondary institutions, shall be all funded by the government, with generous research grants to be handed out to the most promising of scholars at all ages.\n\nOf course, while this is far from cheap, it's an investment - not one that will yield economic results, but an investment into the future of Russia, and, of course, the future of the Unity Party. After all, it was the Unity Party that sponsored the institutions and gave out the grants. And we will make sure that the new generation of talent will remember this - they shall serve Russia, but they will also serve Yedinstvo."
 SAM_zykov_army_on_the_march: "The Army on the March"
 SAM_zykov_army_on_the_march_desc: "The Russian Republic, while finally reunified and stabilized to a degree, is a new state in a turbulent world, where power shifts rapidly and tensions run high at the smallest of diplomatic slights. In this world, it would be a fool's errand to neglect a nation's armed forces - and the President has no intention of doing so.\n\nThe army marched to victory, marching east and pushing our rivals out of their bunkers, cities, and barracks. Now, our army must continue to march - to train, to drill, and to be ready for any future threat. A generous amount of funding shall be bestowed on the army, to keep them happy and combat-ready for when it comes time to look west and liberate the last of Russia."
 SAM_zykov_healthy_society: "A Healthy Society"
 SAM_zykov_healthy_society_desc: "Through no small effort from President Zykov and those who work under him, the foundations of what he has begun referring to as \"the Healthy Society\" have finally begun paying off. President Zykov has created a deep state within the new republic, a body of influential politicians, officers, and businessmen who all work towards the vision that the President has for the nation. The industries are booming, the people are feeling hopeful for the future and are slowly learning the intricacies of Zykov's democracy. And most of all - the military knows its place and is closely monitored by Zykov's friends in high places.\n\nThe dream of a true Russian Republic has never been closer - and the President knows that now, more than ever, the Russian people must be tempered for the future."
 SAM_zykov_statement_to_the_world: "A Statement to the World"
 SAM_zykov_statement_to_the_world_desc: "The President of our Republic has been working on what he calls \"his first statement to the world\". He has prepared to make this statement across international air waves, as well as on a very publicized broadcast domestically.\n\nZykov has formulated what he believes is the best path forward for Russia in the international sphere, now that he has finally unified the nation. Emphasizing the strength of Russia and unilaterally denouncing the Nazis as criminals and warmongers, Zykov also intends on praising the efforts of the United States and the Organization of Free Nations, which, he believes, will bring the Republic closer to the West, and by extension, those best equipped to help Russia when the time comes to push west and make whole the ROA's long journey towards a free, strong Russia."

 SAM_bunyachenko_beyond_the_urals_desc: "The rebirth of the Russian Republic began in West Russia, the most populous area beyond the reach of the Reich. Now, the Republic's future is strengthened by our capture of Western Siberia. The land beyond the Ural contains important industrial centers. More importantly, its rich oil fields are critical resources in our drive to reunite the Motherland.\n\nPresident Bunyachenko and his allies have big plans for the region. It is crucial we begin to integrate the new territories to our economy and strategic situation."

 SAM_bunyachenko_monitor_dissent_desc: "The Committee for the Liberation of the People of Russia has come a long way in its goal to liberate Russia from Bolshevism with the defeat of the WRRF and now the capture of Western Siberia. Yet we are a long way from total victory. In the east, rivals to unification still stand. In the west, Germans rightfully live in fear of our further progress. And within our state, traitors scheme our downfall.\n\nIn the east, remnants of the communist program in Tyumen as well as fanatics of the defeated Black League are angry about our takeover. In the west, our industrial program has created a lot of winners and a lot of losers. Many agitate for further labor rights. Many of those agitating are useful idiots for communist remnants of the WRRF.\n\nWe must be vigilant, and monitor dissenting groups. The Republic must stand strong."
 SAM_bunyachenko_business_opportunity: "Business Opportunity"
 SAM_bunyachenko_business_opportunity_desc: "President Bunyachenko's decision to jumpstart our industrial development through Japanese inspired, vertically integrated financial groups has begun to give great results. Steel and energy production are skyrocketing; advanced goods such as military hardware and consumer electronics are beginning to roll out of the Kombinats' factories at ever greater speed.\n\nTo keep this momentum, the growing Kombinats must continue to expand, and establish themselves in the eastern territories. Resources there are endless; local businessmen underestimate the cunning and rapacity of our industrial collosi. By maintaining a carefully managed pool of great corporations, we can reap the benefits of centralised economic might with free market induced competition and evolution."
 SAM_bunyachenko_growing_prestige: "Growing Prestige"
 SAM_bunyachenko_growing_prestige_desc: "Rising economic and military might are nothing in politics without reputation. The image of a country, its prestige, forms the third leg of the power trinity wielded by all nations. In this regard, our young Republic is remarkably deficient. Our enemies are quick to remind us of our humble beginnings. They call our government a jumped up junta of collaborationist have-beens, led by a dour military officer. A loud but persistent minority of our citizens are likely to agree with this assessment, decrying our current economic miracle as exploitative and unjust.\n\nTo rectify this, our government shall engage in a calculated bout of \"useful splendor\". A few vanity projects here and there; a few high quality apartment buildings for journalists and members of the intelligentsia; a few visits from foreign journalists. Converting the budgetary equivalent of table scraps into soft power will give us yet another tool in our arsenal to crush all threats to Russia."

 SAM_bunyachenko_new_propaganda_tide_desc: "President Bunyachenko is not shy about the errors he committed in his long life. However, he and his comrades in the ROA stand by the fact that helping turn the tide against the WRRF was not a mistake. Already the German empire decays, whereas communism endures across the world.\n\nWe must help convey this to all of the nation's population. The Reds' inability to defeat the Reich and restore stability to Russia was by far the greatest menace to our people's future. President Bunyachenko, aided by his wise advisors, is an epoch making man. An economic and industrial boom the like of which has only been seen so far in Manchuria is in the making, a veritable ecosystem of steel and progress wrought into existence through the Russian man's hard work. Our President has made this possible, and the ROA will make sure that the envious Germans are not able to violently bring it all down. Some may call this a propaganda campaign. How can the spreading of truth be mere propaganda?"

 SAM_bunyachenko_financial_stress_test_desc: "The Japanese have long been pioneers of economic development, their Zaibatsu (or financial cliques) being one of the main inspirations for our own development program. This does not mean that the Sphere's moneymen are perfect; in their hubris, the Japanese have failed to put checks and balance on their financial systems. This came crashing down when piles of bad debts destroyed the Yasuda Zaibatsu and started the Japanese Economic Wars.\n\nTo avoid this fate we can use our central bank as a tool of defence. Every Kombinat will be forced to keep a certain amount of cash on hand, and keep an up to date plan to deal with a market downturn. Every year or so, agents of our government will be allowed to announce a surprise inspection, to verify the stability of each firm's finances. People trying to fudge numbers will be dealt with severely.\n\nThere will be no hubris here. We've come too far to let mere greed upset the stability of Russian recovery. The Kombinats are given great powers; they will owe us great responsibility. For the good of all."

 SAM_bunyachenko_feeding_the_kombinats_desc: "We've encountered a lot of new businesses in the eastern provinces. Our government has also inherited a lot of state owned enterprises from the fallen regimes of West Siberia.\n\nPresident Bunyachenko and his advisers recognize the importance of maintaining government ran businesses in critical sectors, such as energy and national defence. Our government of course also realizes the importance of a free market in a free and strong Russia. Nevertheless, many of these businesses in the eastern provinces are run by people with ties to opposition groups, or by personnel with little interest in our glorious national rejuvenation. As such our bureaucrats are drafting lists of corporations that need to go. Their assets will be auctioned off; their subsidiaries acquired by various Kombinats. This will raise money for the central government, and help the growth of our business partners, all the while reducing overlap in business."

The Russian people tire of being seen as poor and hopeless masses; showing our citizens that our state is admired and respected once more will be great for national pride.\n\nWe've already begun inviting foreigners to visit Russia; mostly foreign dignitaries and men from intelligence agencies at first. It is time to extend this policy to business men, journalists, and anyone else that controls the narrative about Russia. To aid this process we can send out our own people. Businessmen, yes, but also our youth. It is time for Russian youth to be given a chance to study abroad, to see the world that the German ogres have endeavored to deny them. They will be our ambassadors, proof that Russia endures!"

Our economy continues to purr, its growth given a great boost by the newly liberated land and resources. Having dealt with this issue, it is time to turn our attention elsewhere.\n\nEastern Russia still eludes us. In the meantime, the political structures built by President Bunyachenko are still fragile. It is important to continue the elimination of the old officer clique, even as we transition the ROA into the apolitical Republican Army.\n\nNo sacrifice is too great for the final war of liberation. President Bunyachenko will lead us to national vengeance and resurrection."

 SAM_bunyachenko_legislative_shuffling_desc: "With our control over the eastern provinces now secure we can begin integrating them into our government and rolling back martial law. The first step in this process is to hold elections for the Duma in the east, ensuring that Russians on both sides of the Urals are represented in the lower house of the government. We should schedule these elections as quickly as we can, as they will legitimize our government in the eyes of many people who might otherwise resent our new rule.\n\nOf course, the Duma does not hold any real power in the government by design. We will be able to hold free and fair elections knowing that the outcome will not matter. While the people pick their candidates and believe they are participating in democracy, we will continue to steer Russia down the correct course, free of burdensome legislative restrictions and bickering politicians."

 SAM_bunyachenko_ending_the_armys_political_role_desc: "Once the army and the state were almost indistinguishable. Under Vlasov's rule officers and generals held all the power, and the government was barely more than a rubber stamp for their plans. This state of affairs hampered our efforts to reclaim Russia, politicizing the army and making the government inefficient. It is the role of the military to defend the state and the role of the government to administer it. Luckily Bunyachenko's ascension saw this problem begin to end as the old generals retired from both the military and politics. We should encourage this depoliticizing trend, appointing qualified and loyal commanders who understand their job is to serve the government, not run it."

From its inception in the West Russian War to the anarchy of the warlord period to the bloody conquest of Western Russia to the reclamation of Western Siberia the soldiers have fought diligently for years, and we owe them our gratitude. There are more conflicts on the horizon, but before they begin our generals need time to plan and prepare.\n\nWhile the high command prepares for the next battles, we can reward those who will fight them with a vacation. Maintaining the morale of the soldiers on the ground is vital, and nothing boosts morale quite like a trip away from the barracks and the front lines. By the time the next war begins our troops will be refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to bring glory to Russia once more."

Once we were limited to arming our military with the few guns we could produce and whatever outdated tanks and planes we could convince the Germans to sell us. Now we are able to build a new generation of cutting edge Russian weapons that will stand with the finest products of Germany, America, and Japan. New interceptor aircraft will knock enemy planes from our skies, keeping our cities safe, while long-range missiles capable of striking anywhere on earth will force the great powers to take us seriously."

Japan is the undisputed master of the east and wields incredible economic and military might. We would be fools not to court their approval. As we prepare to retake the far east of Russia and finally reunite the nation we should work to secure Japanese support for our endeavours.\n\nInviting diplomats will deepen our ties to the imperial government, while accepting Japanese businessmen will open the door to economic investment from some of the largest corporations in the world.\n\nIf all goes well, once we have reclaimed eastern Siberia there may even be further opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation."

Our domestic industries are now strong enough to stand up to foreign competition, and there is no one we would rather compete with than the Japanese. After the success of our diplomatic overtures to Tokyo, it is time to formally allow Japanese corporations to begin setting up shop in Russia. The investment from these massive financial empires will boost our economy, and the fear of losing customers to their new competitors will motivate Russian corporations to produce higher-quality products."

 SAM_bunyachenko_industrial_defence_act_desc: "The Second World War exposed how vulnerable Russia's west is. Long, flat stretches of territory with few defensive features to shelter behind, it was a conqueror's dream. Now, as conflict with the Germans looms once more, our western provinces are under threat again. Just like last time our territory stretches for thousands of kilometers, but the majority of our industry is located within a few hundred of the enemy border. We must change this. All factories, especially those that produce military goods, capable of relocation will move east of the Urals towards Central Siberia. This will place them out of reach of all but the longest range bombers, and make sure our industry remains out of enemy hands."

It seems there is no limit to what the Japanese can invent and we would be fools if we did not try to acquire some of their wondrous equipment. Our technological industry is not advanced enough to replicate these designs on our own, so we must ask for help from our new partners in the Pacific. It is quite unlikely the Japanese will be willing to give up their secrets for free of course. If necessary we would be more than happy to pay for the designs of these futuristic weapons and several hundred prototypes to get us started."

The Germans will be driven from Moscow, the Russian people will be liberated, and the humiliation of the last war will finally be avenged. Before we can tackle the Germans though we must deal with the issue of the east. Defeating the Nazis will require all of Russia working together, and for now eastern Siberia remains out of our control. We must reclaim Siberia, establish a permanent connection with our partners in Japan, and rally the Russian people for the great war of redemption. Only then will we be ready to strike."

 SAM.8.t: "ドイツとの関係"

 SAM.10.d: "村の男たちは、休日の服装の中で最も不潔でなく、最も血の気のない服を着て、教会に沈痛な面持ちで座っていた。サマラから来た奇妙な男を中心に、椅子がざっと円形に並べられていた。壁にもたれているのは兵士たちで、彼らの武器はライフルの吊り輪からさりげなくぶらさがっていた。\n\n「友よ、兄弟よ。君達はロシア解放軍を助けるために、この集会に呼ばれたんだ！私たちの支配下にある土地に、自由と民主主義をもたらすことが、私たちの希望だ。今日はあなたとあなたの家族の意見を聞きに来た。解決してほしい問題は何かあるかい？市民のみんなの生活をどのように改善したいかい？」\n\n気まずい沈黙。誰かが半ば強引に手を挙げ、そして考え直す。不屈の民衆の友には、まだ早かったようだ。ズィコフはその男を指差した。「君、私の友よ、何か考えていることがあるのかい？」\n\n「あの…その…兵士たちが税金を取りに来るんですが、同じ額にはならないんです。いくら必要なのか事前に知りたいんです。そうすれば、彼らに渡す準備をすることができるんです」これにはズィコフも頷いた。それに触発されたのか、他の数人が不満を口にしたが、常に部屋の兵士たちに敬意を払った。畑を占拠して長い間眠っていた廃墟、村人の半数が家を失った空襲、地雷、夜中に爆発する不発弾……この辺境の村が抱える無数の問題が少しずつ浮かび上がってきた。ロシア解放軍の宣伝担当者は、この情報を有効に活用し、数回パトロールを行うことにした。これで十分だろう……そして、村人たちが恩人のことを思い出してくれることを願おう。"
 SAM.10.a: "民衆の男、ミーレティー・ズィコフ。"
 SAM.11.t: "配給日"
 SAM.11.d: "ロシア解放軍の兵士たちは、月に一度、駐屯地を出て、徴税に必要な資源やわずかな作物を集めるのが通例だった。それ以外の時間だったら、この地域の住民が解放軍のことを忘れていても不思議ではなかった。この地域には盗賊がほとんどいないため、ロシア解放軍は形だけの巡回をしていた。\n\n今日は珍しく、兵士たちがあちこちを行進していた。駐屯地から小さな集落へ、馬と人が荷物を積んで蛇行しながら移動していた。ロシア解放軍の新政策である再分配が始まったのだ。\n\n食糧難の村には、配給物資と穀物が配られた。爆撃や徴兵、負傷などで人員や労働者を失った地域には、地元の駐屯地から数十時間の労働を補償してもらった。中には、驚いた子供たちが需品係将校からキャンディーをもらったという嬉しそうな報告もあった。\n\nこの計算された気前の良さは、悲観で疲れ切った村人たちを感動させた。餓死者が出るまでひたすら待つという生活から、新しい配給があれば、それなりの生活ができるようになったのだ。しかもその間、男も女も食べるのに夢中で、反ロシア解放軍運動家の話など聞くことはないだろう。"

 SAM.12.t: "毎日の選別"
 SAM.12.d: "オクタンの弾圧によってサマラ全土から捕らえられた政治犯が、毎日放り込まれていた。その者たちは、混み合った独房の中で、汚物と怒りにまみれながら、毎日のトリアージを待っていた。\n\nロシア解放軍に反対する反体制派でさえ、オクタン派は利用した。囚人たちは、心理テストや残忍な検査を受け、3つのグループに分けられた。危険と判断された者、命令に従わない者は処刑された。次に、ロシア解放軍を憎んではいるが、おとなしくて自分では動けない者たちは、様々な労働キャンプに送られ、その労働力によって家族の安全を守る国家を維持していた。もちろん、給料も食事も出された。\n\n最後に、自由を得るために何でもする人たちがいた。共産主義者や盗賊団の仲間になるのは、彼らにとってはとんでもない判断ミスであった。彼らはロシア解放軍に罰金を支払い、自由になるのを許された。彼らが牢獄から出て行くと監房の前に連れて行かれた。そこには腹を立てた故郷の男たちがいて、誰が屈したのかを見ることができた。釈放された囚人たちは、故郷でロシア解放軍に服従し続けることで、仕事と安全を手に入れるしかなかった。\n\n政治犯は毎日のように投入されたが、そのペースは遅々として進まなかった。取り締まりは迅速で無慈悲だった。労働年齢の男性が選別のために連行されたため、地域社会はこれまで以上に静かになり、サマラに平和が戻った。"
 SAM.12.a: "もう邪魔はさせない。"
 SAM.13.t: "権力の中枢にて"
 SAM.13.d: "辺境を離れ、サマラまで足を運んだのは、歓迎すべきことだった。バラショフは、ひどい酒とさらにひどい売春宿のある泥沼のような場所には慣れていた。\n\nだが、サマラでの滞在は休養のためではなかった。西ロシアで新たに戦争が勃発するとの噂があり、移動可能なほぼすべての将校が最終指導者会議に招かれ、意見を述べることになっていたのだ。将校委員会は、すべての将校の意見が考慮されると主張し、他にも様々なことを主張した。\n\nその中で、誰もが口にする切実な話題があった。ウラソフの後継者は誰なのだ？バラショフは、そんなことを気にもとめていなかった。だが、バラショフ以外の人はどうだろうか。サマラで繰り広げられる小競り合いとは程遠く、ロシア解放軍の大半はパトロールや訓練、地元住民の監視に時間を費やしていた。この先どうなるかは誰にもわからない。そんな計画を立てるのが、サマラのエリート集団の道楽だった。\n\nバラショフは22歳の時、ドイツ軍に徴兵された。婚約者と別れて共産主義者と戦うよう、銃口を突きつけられて強制されたのは25歳の時だった。今、彼は35歳である。婚約者、子供たちがどうなったかは分からない。もう故郷には戻れないと諦めていた。しかし、ウラソフの後を継ぐ者たちが、彼に希望を持たせてくれるかもしれない。"
 SAM.13.a: "その可能性はほとんどないだろうが。"
 SAM.14.t: "同志"
 SAM.14.d: "理屈の上では、その日のテーマは、新たに解放された地域を管理する最善の方法についてだけだった。その中で若い大尉が、民間人との協調、連携について熱弁をふるった。次に話をした将校は、将校委員会の上層部の代弁者であるブニャチェンコ将軍だった。バラショフは、ブニャチェンコの演説よりも、彼自身に興味があった。結局、将軍の主張は、大衆に力を与えすぎることの危険性についてという、いつもの主張であり、それは将軍のウクライナ訛りが含まれた立派な反論であった。だがバラショフは、将校の言葉よりも、将校委員会の口車に乗せられていることに興味を持った。\n\nブニャチェンコの険しい表情に、バラショフは自分や部下の姿を重ねた。不幸な決意、悲しみと喪失の10年。将軍の目が唯一輝いたのは、自分たちの未来を奪った憎き共産主義者とドイツ人のことを口にした時だった。ブニャチェンコ司令官は気骨のある者で、バラショフが喜んで戦場について行くような人物だった。ただ一つバラショフの心に残った謎は、ブニャチェンコの夢であった。このような男が、ウラソフのように将校委員会の傀儡のままでいるのだろうか。それとも、委員長という立場を利用して、それ以上のものになるのだろうか。"
 SAM.14.a: "もしかしたら、まだ命があるかもしれない。"
 SAM.15.t: "夕陽を追いかけて"
 SAM.15.d: "その日の会議が終わった。バラショフをはじめとする数人の将校が、1日の話を終えて軽食を取るために近所のバーに集まった。議会開催中のサマラ市はもとより、この建物もロシア解放軍関係者で溢れかえっていた。\n\nその中に、熱弁を振るったズィコフ派の民主化推進者の一人がいた。その演説者は、バラショフたちに手を振って、自分らの将校たちの隣の席に座るように勧めた。バラショフはおもむろにその席に向かい、バーテンダーに飲み物を注文した。ズィコフ派の人と一緒に夜を過ごしてみるか。\n\n民主化運動の演説者は、バラショフが想像していたより、ずっと気さくな人物だった。彼はオレンブルク・コミューンとの国境地帯出身の大佐で、西ロシア戦争の古参であった。西ロシア解放戦線との死闘の思い出、戦線崩壊後の南東部領を盗賊から守るための有名な作戦。大佐の任務が静かな南東部であったとすれば、それは彼がその静寂を作ることに貢献したからである。\n\n「ズィコフと、農民から下級将校になった奴らとなんで集まってるんだ？あのバカを助けるより他にやることがあるだろ？」バラショフの仲間の一人が、酒で舌が緩んだのか、そう尋ねた。大佐の酒飲み仲間は苦笑いを浮かべたが、大佐自身は肩をすくめた。「山賊を潰した時、南東部の奴らは感謝してくれた。赤軍やロシア解放軍で、何十年も無意味な闘争を続けてきたが、誰かのために戦うというのは、いい気分だろ？」大佐は酒を飲み干した。"
 SAM.15.a: "もしかしたら、ロシア解放軍も西に沈むかもしれない。"
 SAM.16.t: "他の道"
 SAM.16.d: "バラショフは、仲間の将校と共にトラックに乗って家に帰った。数人が指導者会議について話し、残りの者は首都で最近手に入れたもの、つまり酒やタバコ、二束三文の小物について話し合った。中尉の一人は、ロシア解放軍入隊時に支給され、すっかり老朽化したワルサーP38の代わりに、ワルサーPPKを見せびらかし、新しい玩具を披露していた。\n\nトラックに乗っている男の多くは、自分の給料では到底敵わないような高収入を得ていた。バラショフは、首都にいる友好的な将校やオクタン司令官の仲間を思い浮かべた。モスコーヴィエンとの貿易は、それ自体が一つの組織であり、そのメンバーはロシア解放軍の中でも最も裕福で気前のいい人たちだった。\n\n指導者会議の席上、彼らもまた、自分たちのボスをウラソフの後継者とすることを主張していた。その中で、ズィコフの愚かな理想主義や、ブニャチェンコの無気力な操り人形である将校委員会に対して、怒りの声を上げた。ロシア解放軍は強大であるから、強い指導者を持つべきではないのか？兵士と将校を養うことができる指導者こそ、必要ではないのか？ロシア全土に規律と秩序と進歩をもたらすことができるのではないか？少なくとも、オクタンの代理人たちは、議論の中でそう話していた。彼らは話し合い、多くの財宝を与えた。多くの人脈を持つ人物と親しくするのは得策だった。バラショフはまだこの男たちから何も貰ってはいない。しかし、その選択肢は彼の頭の中に残っていた……"

 SAM.17.t: "ウラソフの秘話"
 SAM.17.d: "今日、アンドレイ・ウラソフはしぶしぶながら、将来「ウラソフの秘密演説」として知られることになるものをロシア解放軍の最上級将校たちに行い、後任を発表した。このところ年老いた議長の体調が思わしくないことは、口には出されてはいないがよく知られており、多くの人がこの日が来ると長い間予期していた。\n\nこの日、ウラソフの側近の1人が最後の演説の準備に付き添い、1時間以内に議長の後任を発表した。彼は、15分前に将校会で発表前の定例会議を開くことになっていたが、わざわざ出席することもなかった。議長室に入ることを許された数少ない補佐官は、黙って老司令官を観察していた。眉をひそめ、執務室は肌寒いのに、顔は汗で光っているように見える。手書きで紙に書かれた台本を、読むでもなく、手直しするのでもなく、ただじっと見ているのだ。補佐官は時計を見た。「サー、あの－－」ウラソフが勝手に遅刻した場合の罰則を熟知している彼は、元帥を急がせようとした。しかし、ウラソフは側近が話すと同時に手を挙げ、側近の言葉を無言で打ち消した。元帥はゆっくりと立ち上がると、紙切れをポケットに畳んだ。「行こうか？」彼は側近に尋ねた。「ええ」側近はそう答えた。\n\n老司令官は将校たちの前に立った。その中には、ロシア解放軍が創設されてから一緒の者もいた。見慣れた顔もあるが、初めて見る顔も少なくない。もしかして、新しい者か？ウラソフは自問した。部屋が静まり返り、全員が彼を見て待っていた。あるいは、彼らが誰なのか忘れてしまったのだろうか。ため息をつきながら、ウラソフは紙に目を落とし、ようやく口を開いた。\n\n「諸君らも知っても通り、私はもう長くはない。そろそろ、ロシア解放軍の正式な後継者を発表する時が来たのだ。私が選んだのは……」"

 SAM.18.t: "ブニャチェンコの強要"
 SAM.18.d: "Miletiy Zykov and a number of his more prominent allies sat in one of the many formal conference rooms common to the governmental buildings that dotted Samara. Now that he had begun to grab a hold on the reins of power, he knew that he had to address one of the two elephants in the crowded metaphorical room - Sergey Bunyachenko. The mouthpiece for the officers. Bunyachenko had been one of Vlasov's competing successors, meaning that he held enough clout and influence to pose a real threat to Zykov's plans, if he so wished. They had scheduled an impromptu meeting with the general, and he was running late.\n\nThe doors creaked open as Bunyachenko ungracefully stepped through. His uniform was dishevelled and his eyes were bloodshot. It looked as if he had been drinking, at the very least just last night, if not into this morning as well. \"Good morning, I apologize for my tardiness\", Bunyachenko started. \"I had lost track of time while I-\"\n\nZykov interrupted. \"It doesn't matter! We've called you here because we want to discuss your future with the Russian Liberation Army.\" Bunyachenko's eyes widened. \"Don't worry, we're not having you shot.\" One of the officers chimed in.\n\nZykov glanced at his peer dismissively, before turning to Bunyachenko once more. \"No, I suppose we aren't. You represent something that is of value to me, Sergey.\" Zykov asserted. \"You have the ear of the people we need to hear, and who need to be heard by us. The way I see it... we'll keep you around, with a generous salary, and not only will you remain at the head of our armed forces, but you will also report directly to us about any goings on in the army that would need to be reported on. Does that make sense?\" A short, curt nod from the general followed, and he was dismissed."
 SAM.18.a: "The velvet glove."
 SAM.19.t: "ミハイル・オクタンの問題"
 SAM.19.d: "\"We all know who he is,\" Zykov began. \"And we all know who's in his pocket.\"\n\nIt was true. Now that Zykov had assumed control of the Russian Liberation Army, he had real reason to suspect that Mikhail Oktan, a well-known corrupt officer and a reveller in the less-than-savory operations undertaken by some of our soldiers, was one of the driving forces behind the instability following Zykov's ascent to power. \"But right now, acting against him would be disastrous. The web he's spun himself is far too wide; he controls too much.\" Zykov concluded, edging out any of his more hawkish supporters in their over-enthusiasm to deal with the individual.\n\n\"But that's not to say, of course, that we should merrily leave him to prepare a coup. He operates on a system that centers around his ability to buy his supporters, which means that for a certain price, almost all of them can be bought back. I'd like to have a list drawn up of names that we can convince to come over to us... and a list of those who likely won't be bought, so that we can begin planning arrests of key figures. We may not be able to take him out, yet, but we can whittle him down. Does all of that make sense?\"\n\nAides had been busily writing down the chairman's orders, but all nodded in unison as the chairman looked for their understanding. Dismissing themselves, they quickly went to work narrowing down Oktan's supporters and crossing out their lists, name by name."

 SAM.20.t: "We Propose to Go Faster"
 SAM.20.d: "Zykov had been a busy man.\n\nVlasov was a man of immense power, that was undeniable. But the problem was that he had a distinct lack of will to utilize that power: always concerned about maintaining the coalition above else, even at the expense of Samara and the people of Russia as a whole. Now, though, Zykov was the one in charge, at least for now. And he had more than utilized it.\n\nVlasov had many friends, and his enemies had many divisions. It was child's play, bouncing them back and forth using the bureaucracy, benefiting one at the expense of the other. And all the while, Zykov was promoting allies to the levers of power, the keys to a better future, both in the Committee and in government. Nothing big -- a secretary position here, a subdepartment headship here, all an intricately connected web of connections and friends that, when the time came, would remember who helped them and their families.\n\nAnd then there was the people, the broken, shattered remnants of a once great country. They hated the Committee, and rightly so. They were, after all, a bunch of German bootlickers - for now, at least. But they would learn, in time, to rely on them. The bare bones of a welfare state, with regular drops of food and protection and a general upgrade in a standard of living would keep them satisfied, especially after experiencing almost twenty years of deprivation.\n\nBut this was just the setting of the stage. The actors would be brought together, the probs created. All that remind was the script, with Zykov as the writer.\n\nAnd Zykov wanted to go faster."
 SAM.20.a: "There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."
 SAM.21.t: "A Chat with the Chief Democrat"
 SAM.21.d: "One of his aides announced that Miletiy Zykov had arrived. Commander Bunyachenko remained at his desk as the former journalist was shown in. Both men shook hands.\n\n\"Deputy-Chairman. You've summoned me?\" Asked Zykov, sitting down. \"That I have. I found myself reflecting on your successful campaign to become Deputy-Chairman. Chairman Vlasov has always spoken well of your ability to inspire and spread a message. These aptitudes will be needed in the coming wars of unification.\" Zykov frowned slightly, and spoke. \"I'm afraid, Deputy-Chairman, that I will be unable to give my full support to the Officer Committee and to your program. After all, the democratic ideals I fight for were rejected at the convention. What w-\" Bunyachenko cut him off. \"Forget idealism. Take a look around, what do you see? Tired men in the Officer Committee, unwilling to recognize that half of their staff has been bribed by Oktan. Enemies all around us, plotting to hang us as traitors. Chairman Vlasov, too tired to intervene directly. I know you're not a fool, despite your reputation. I need your help to stave off chaos. There won't be a Russia to spread democracy to if the communists are sitting here next year.\"\n\nZykov thought for a moment. His eternally confident demeanor did irritate Bunyachenko slightly. Difficult to read what went on behind the man's cheerful mask. Finally Zykov offered his hand for Bunyachenko to shake. \"I'll offer what I can. As we both know, I have my own interests, but I think these work out beautifully with yours, Deputy-Chairman.\" Bunyachenko shook the hand of his new chief propagandist. Hopefully the association would be a profitable one."
 SAM.21.a: "A new pen to back the sword."
 SAM.22.t: "A Matter of Perspective"
 SAM.22.d: "Bunyachenko hated having to deal with the pesky reality of reputation - or, as Zykov described it, 'public relations', which somehow made Bunyachenko squirm a little bit, if only because it sounded so American. But even if he hated it, he still had to deal with it, one way or another. And who was better to clean up Marshal Vlasov's image as a German bootlicker than Zykov, the chief 'PR' man himself?\n\nIt was a test run at first, to see how far they could get with a little bit of glorification. Posters of Vlasov shown side by side with his men, inspecting them and generally being an attractive leader of the people. Then it expanded to constant radio bombardments of the 'real' history of Vlasov's supposed 'betrayal' - which was, according to those announcements, was in reality a last ditch effort to protect the Russian people. Then, when that was done, the minor financiation of a couple of cheap plays, depicting the Great Patriotic War, with Vlasov as the tragic hero of the war that broke Russia into a thousand pieces.\n\nThen, as the people began to think that, perhaps, just maybe, they had been wrong, it was time to bring out the tears: show the faces of the men whose families were in concentration camps, their broken, shattered faces being reminded of the horrible fate that awaited them at the death camps. Then make them stare at the camera or, in the most effective cases, have them say, with no hint of sarcasm or dislike, 'Vlasov was only trying to do what was best for me and my family.'\n\nIt was a good show, Bunyachenko admitted, especially considering how Zykov found an actor that could emote so well. A little saccharine, but Zykov knew how to play a crowd. Maybe by the end of the year, Vlasov would be as well loved as he was hated the year before."
 SAM.22.a: "If you don't tell a story, someone else will."
 SAM.23.t: "銀行の破壊"
 SAM.23.d: "Bunyachenko sat at his desk, thinking about his family when Oktan walked into his office. Ah, he thought, he had finally arrived.\n\n\"I was asked to meet with you, General Bunyachenko. What seems to be the issue?\" asked Oktan, his face betraying absolutely nothing.\n\n\"Ah, well, General Oktan, there is an issue I am hoping to deal with, privately. You must understand.\"\n\nOktan's eyebrow rose slightly, but other than that Bunyachenko couldn't see anything behind that little mask he wore. \"Of course, General. Permission to sit?\"\n\n\"Please.\"\n\nAs Oktan sat down, they were face to face, only a feet or so from each other. \"General Oktan, there have been reports among many in the citizenry that many of your troops have been involved in smuggling and racketeering. I was wondering if you were dealing with this issue.\"\n\nOktan smiled a little. \"Ah, of course, General, I am dealing with it to the best of my abilities.\"\n\n\"That is good, because we found something truly strange in one of these reports.\"\n\n\"What sort of strange, General?\"\n\n\"Well, apparently, one of our MPs found at a local bar one of your squadrons, drunk. One of them began talking about a 'Swiss' who is involved in the local gun smuggling trade. With a little perusation, our MP was able to locate this Swiss, who was being guarded by some of your men. When asked, your men stated that it was 'official state business under the orders of General Oktan'. Strange, isn't it?\"\n\nOktan's mask was cracking. \"Then, when this MP infiltrated the facility, they found this.\" Bunyachenko opened a drawer, and brought out dozens of photos of men transporting German goods: watches, wine, tobacco, clothing, even technology.\n\n\"It would be a shame, if one of our own generals was found complicit in such activities as the expense of the people.\"\n\nOktan's face had gone white.\n\n\"Perhaps, a deal can be made,\" Bunyachenko said, pulling a piece of paper out, written in big bold letters at the top: VOLUNTARY DEMOTION. \"I only require your signature.\""

 SAM.24.d: "How long had it been? Good cognac like this? Starikov had no clue. But important occasions deserved important celebrations. The officer saw Deputy-Chairman Oktan leaning over with a pair of new cigarettes. Starikov took one of them.\n\n\"Isn't it careless, tough,\" Starikov lit up his new cigarette. \"Not striking against Zykov and Commander Bunyachenko?\"Oktan smiled, a cloud of smoke drifting through his crooked grin. \"Eager to strike so soon against your old boss? Eh, Starikov?\" Oktan took a sip of cognac. \"They still have their uses, discredited as they are. And they still command significant influence.\" Another sip. \"Far better to keep discrediting them, make use of their power until we've eroded it completely.\" The grid widend. \"Then, we can crush them.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say boss. So this first assignment. An... acquaintance of ours will give me a package.\" A nod from Oktan. \"I'm to leak its content to the proper channels.\" Another nod. \"Are you sure this will not get back to Commander Bunyachenko?\" Oktan' smile deepened further still. \"I'm certain of it.\""
 SAM.24.a: "\"Alright, get to it Starikov.\""
 SAM.25.t: "Silent Halls"
 SAM.25.d: "Despite the selection of Oktan as Deputy-Chairman, and the ensuing morale blow to his own faction of democrats, Miletiy Zykov worked harder than ever. Of course, part of this workload was caused by his ever dwindling staff.\n\nIt felt as if every other day began with a resignation, or its silent equivalent of the staffer simply not appearing for work. Those who had appeared in front of him to hand in their resignation had been gently questioned. Most insisted they were simply retiring from politics. One or two of the honest ones explained that deputy-chairman Oktan had offered a better deal. Land, money, positions of importance, it seemed that the good deputy-chairman never ran out of agreeable rewards for those who befriended him, thought Zykov.\n\nAll this was not good, but it was not extremely bad for the moment. In a way, it was a good thing to see those not entirely dedicated to the cause just up and leave. The remaining core of Zykov's organization would be more motivated than ever to see justice and democracy be restored to Russia. Oktan's constant war on the democratic faction (as well as on the Officer Committee, Zykov suspected) would not go unacknowledged however. The former journalist sighed, and picked up the phone. It was time to organize a few meetings of his own. Some of the democratic faction's best assets, after all, did not operate in the light, either."

 SAM.26.t: "A Meeting with the Deputy-Chairman"
 SAM.26.d: "Commander Bunyachenko's usual dour expression did not seem to account the luxurious location in which he now sat. A few tasteful paintings hung on the walls of Oktan's office. Deputy-Chairman Oktan returned from the wood and crystal cabinet, holding a bottle of Georgian cognac and two glasses. The dour military officer did not offer any thanks upon being served a glass. He did, to his host's surprise, offer a toast. \"To Russia.\" \"To Russia!\" Replied Oktan.\n\nBoth men were barely seated when Commander Bunyachenko leaned forward. \"Why did you invite me, Deputy-Chairman?\" \"For a dr-\" \"Don't even finish that sentence, please.\" Bunyachenko cut off Oktan. \"You are in a position of strength. My organization is not. Have you invited me here to gloat?\" Oktan scoffed at the question. \"How rude such a thing would be. And besides, why do you speak of your organization, Commander Bunyachenko? The Officer Committee uses you as a mouthpiece, yes? Because you've been here-to entirely unconcerned with political games of your own.\"\n\nBunyachenko took a sip of cognac. His expression was still neutral. \"Hereto, deputy Chairman?\" He finally asked. Oktan laughed pleasantly. \"It is no secret that of late you've been dissatisfied with your patrons, and their inability to stand up to me. Why not ditch them? I've use of men who will fight for Russia.\" The stern officer swirled the cognac around his glass. He finally replied:\"What of Zykov's faction?\" Oktan laughed again. \"They've received a similar offer. I've a need for people who want to fight, commander. The Front, and those idiots in Vyatka, they're tough opposition. We need to come together if we're to win Western Russia.\"\n\nOktan thought he saw the hint of a retort in the other man's eyes. Yet Bunyachenko kept quiet. Emptied his glass. Stood. Finally, he spoke. \"My loyalty is to the ROA, its chairman, and its deputy chairman. Thank you for the drink, Commander Oktan.\" He saluted, before leaving the office, without waiting for Oktan's reply."

 SAM.27.d: "As we prepare to expand the Liberation Army's area of influence, a proposal has been made by a number of officers and other functionaries. A proposal of diplomacy.\n\nAccording to them, before taking any hostile action against the Neutral State or the government in Vologda, we should first extend an offer of peaceful re-integration. Of effective surrender, from them to us. Though some officers dismissed the idea immediately, others have spoken of its inherent merits.\n\nSending such an offer would show, not only to other states but also to all the peoples of Russia, that we at least attempted peaceful actions before resorting to forcible ones. A perception that could be of significant assistance in the future. In addition, any such offer would also implicitly make a threat of subsequent invasion clear.\n\nHowever, it has been brought to our attention that such a course possesses significant inherent risk. Should the Neutral State prove resistant to our 'offer,' they would be made aware of a likely imminent invasion, and be given the opportunity to prepare defenses and other plans of their own.\n\nThere are merits and flaws to either course of action, but a decision must be made. What should be done?"
 SAM.27.a: "Let us attempt diplomacy. Send the 'offer.'"
 SAM.28.t: "An 'Offer' from the Russian Liberation Army"
 SAM.28.d: "We have today received an 'offer' from the government of the so-called 'Russian Liberation Army' based in Samara.\n\nAccording to their envoy, the Army is offering us the chance to peacefully re-integrate our lands with theirs as they continue their efforts towards regional unification. In essence, they are asking for our surrender, and threatening hostile action should we decline.\n\nMembers of our government are split. On one hand, several argue that the Neutral State does not possess the strength to resist such an invasion, and that agreeing to the proposal could not only save lives, but also perhaps allow us to secure certain protections or concessions in response. Despite reservations at extending trust to the collaborators, they argue it is the only reasonable option.\n\nOthers, however, disagree vehemently, calling it madness to trust such criminals, and that the only thing this 'offer' gives us is the opportunity to prepare for an invasion we now know is coming. That we now know is inevitable. This knowledge, they claim, could be enough to turn the tides in our favor in any conflict.\n\nRegardless, however, a response must be given. What should it be?"
 SAM.28.a: "Accept the offer. We do not have the strength to resist."
 SAM.29.t: "Vologda Agrees to Annexation!"
 SAM.29.d: "Our decision to reach out to the government in Vologda about peaceful reintegration was a wise one. Because they have agreed.\n\nAlready, a large delegation of their civilian and military officials have been dispatched to Samara, in order to coordinate the subsumption of their political structure into our own. And our officials will work very closely with them to ensure that the procedure, in its entirety, goes smoothly.\n\nIf, and when, it does, it will serve as an example to the other statelets of Western Russia that the Russian Liberation Army exists to do just that, in as peaceful and cooperative a manner as possible. It will prove that our word, long denigrated - and not without cause - as that of German collaborators, can be trusted. It will show that we have the moral capability to lead.\n\nBeyond that, however, it also offers us a large expansion of territory, many new resources, a large population pool to leverage for conscripts, and a better strategic position within our region, all properties that we intend to exploit to the fullest. The decision was a gambit, yes, and was much criticized among parts of the Army's officer corps, but it has paid off.\n\nWhile we cannot count on further bloodless victories in the times ahead, we can at least take pride in this one, and in the conservation of military strength that it promises."

 SAM.30.d: "Unfortunately, the government in Vologda has refused our generous offer of peaceful reintegration. Their lands will now have to be 'acquired' through other, and more violent, means.\n\nAlready, orders have been dispatched to the army to begin preparing plans and timetables for potential military action against the Neutral State, and given the significant disparity in military capability between them and ourselves, it is not expected that any such preparations will take long. But that is not the primary concern.\n\nTheir refusal has denied us the opportunity to prove that we are more than what we are seen to me. That we are no longer simply German collaborators. That we can give our word, that we can promise equitable and peaceful reunification, if permitted, and then follow through. And now we must, yet again, use force, and accept the repercussions of its use.\n\nSo be it. We will secure the lands of the Neutral State by military force, and incorporate its resources, its people, and its strategic position into our own, improving our ability to pursue further campaigns of regional unification.\n\nWe can only hope that this failure does not portend similar diplomatic failures in the future. If it does, our plans of expansion could be made much more difficult, indeed."

Why, in God's name, have I been let go?\"\n\nThe little bureaucrat looked down at his paper patiently, making Alexi want to punch the little bastard in the face even harder. It was already taking everything inside of him to avoid doing that, in spite of how good it would have felt.\n\n\"You,\" began the bureaucrat, \"have been dismissed for incompetence.\"\n\n\"Incompetence? What the hell is that supposed to mean? I've been good enough for the Committee for eight years prior, so why now?\"\n\n\"Your specific treatment of certain...problematic people, has made things complicated.\"\n\n\"Ah, I understand now, I understand perfectly.\"\n\nThe bureaucrat's eyes blinked without emotion, his old face sagging down ever so slightly.\n\n\"I let those two commie hooligans go, that's it? Tell those Committee bastards that in spite of what the papers said, they were kids: thirteen, fourteen. I wasn't gonna throw two lives away because of some dumb shit they did when they were young.\"\n\n\"I will make sure to tell my superiors that. Good day, Mr. Bolshakov.\" And with that, the bureaucrat left the front steps of Alexi's home. He slammed the door shut, and, leaning against it, fell to the floor.\n\nHe hadn't been the first. It had been happening all through Samara. People dismissed without warning, histories being 'discovered' that placed them in an 'unprofessional light'. At first it had been the small guys: secretaries, postman, etc. Then they had gone after department heads, city officials, even the Mayor, for God's sake, all because of some unspecified 'incompetence' or 'unreliability.' Everyone knew what it was, but no one was gonna talk about it for fear of making things even worse.\n\nAlexi sighed. Might as well try to find some new job in town now."

All knew what was to be required of them, and none looked forward to it. Worried soldiers checked and rechecked their weapons while mechanics and crewmen repeatedly looked over their vehicles. Logistics officers stockpiled supplies and worried about rates of expenditure, while officers wondered just how many men they'd send to an early grave.\n\nIt was a scene repeated across dozens of other camps and bases, as the men of the Russian Liberation Army prepared to go on the warpath once more. Vologda had refused to submit, and so the Neutral State would be crushed. It had to be, for the good of all of Russia."
 SAM.32.a: "Unfortunate, but necessary."
 SAM.33.t: "The People's Hope"
 SAM.33.d: "Milety Zykov stood in his new office in Samara. Just hours ago he had been proclaimed the Deputy-Chairman of the Russian Liberation Army, a position he had not expected to be elevated to. He and much of the ROA had expected a more military-minded choice. The people of Samara had mixed feelings. The idea of a civilian in charge of the region was certainly appealing to them, but he knew they still resented every member of the ROA. Indeed, he understood that more than most.\n\nWith luck and no small amount of prodding, hopefully, they would grow to accept the KONR as their best hope for a unified Russia. Zykov sat at his desk and began making calls. Vlasov had given him wide latitude to act on his own, with all the authority of the Chairman himself. Despite his official confirmation as Deputy-Chairman, he knew his position was insecure. The officers under the sway of the bastard Oktan would have to be either bribed or arrested, as their master would undoubtedly be preparing moves of his own. The man was a snake in the grass at the best of times and would have to be dealt with sooner or later.\n\nMore importantly, Bunyachenko's clique needed to be brought onto his side. They represented the largest part of the ROA and would be the key to neutering Oktan's support among the enlisted. Even simply securing Sergey's support would go far in stabilizing his support amongst the ROA, as they were none too pleased by the appointment of a civilian propagandist.\n\nThe most important part of Zykov's plans, however, lay with the people who lived under the KONR's rule. They would be the most important to win over by far. Without the support of the people, he would be nothing more than another petty dictator fighting over the scraps left by the Soviet Union in its death throes. In the long term, he envisioned a true democracy for all the people of Russia, one that would forever bury the legacy of Tsars and Communists in Russia.\n\nBut such thoughts were for the future. In the here and now he had to juggle the influence of snakes and soldiers, all in hope for a future he could be proud of."
 SAM.33.a: "Best of luck, Deputy-Chairman."
 SAM.34.t: "A Plan for Strength"
 SAM.34.d: "Sergey Bunyachenko paced back and forth within his office. His promotion to Deputy-Chairman of the Committee came as no great surprise, he had been pegged as Vlasov's most likely successor long ago. His fellow ROA officers had been lobbying on his behalf for years and now that he had ascended to his new position he would take full advantage of his new powers. The ROA was in dire need of restructuring. Mikhail Oktan and his clique were a threat to Bunyachenko's new position and to the Committee as a whole. The man would need to be demoted. As much as Sergey would rather kill the bastard, he was simply too influential at the moment. If he did not take care then he could easily find himself dead in the night, with Oktan all too willing to take power.\n\nThere was another thorn in his side as well. Milety Zykov was something of a decent man, though a little spineless for his tastes. It could only be beneficial to bring him towards Sergey's way of thinking. With Zykov's support, he would have an in with the people. The people of Samara, and of all of Russia itself, would need convincing that the ROA was capable of creating a strong Russia, free of the problems that plagued the Tsarist and Communist regimes. Zykov was just the man for the job, he was a master of propaganda and could surely curtail any thoughts of revolt amongst the masses.\n\nHis pacing came to an end and he took a seat at his desk. With a resolve rarely seen in the Russian anarchy, he began to write orders that would go out across KONR territory. The people needed work, the ROA needed guns, and the Chairman needed to know that he would be up to the task of forging a Russia that would have the strength to overcome its enemies and rise to the levels of the great powers."
 SAM.34.a: "All will work for the strength of Russia."
 SAM.35.t: "The Last Day of Prisoner Romanov"
 SAM.35.d: "The sun shone on Vladimir Kirillovich's final day on earth. The prisoner was not melodramatic enough to wish for a storm in his final hours. Such weather might have been more fitting as a coda to a life of exile, leading to war and then a troubled reign in the Russian Anarchy. But the former tsar did not begrudge the weather. It felt good to walk on a sunny day for a final time.\n\nHis thoughts went to other kings, dethroned and killed like common criminals. His would be the fate of Maximilian of Mexico, given at least the honor of a soldier's death against the wall. Better than Louis and Charles, decapitated like common criminals. Far better than his second cousin's death in a stuffy, dark basement lit only by the flash of drunk communist gunmen.\n\nThe sun shone on Samara, but not the warm, pleasant sun of France where he had lived after the revolution. He had never known what to think of the vast skies of Russia he had longed for while in exile. His opinion still eluded him as the soldier brought him to the wall. All around the plaza, scores of citizens of the so called freed Russia looked at him, their emotions as hard to read as Vladimir's own.\n\nGunmen in front of him. Hard to swallow. Vladimir tried to blink away the fear. Thoughts of Leonida, of Maria. Perhaps they had made it to exile. Too late to worry. A wave of flashes, then nothing."
 SAM.35.a: "So sets the sun on the Romanovs."
 SAM.36.t: "The Long Dawn"
 SAM.36.d: "Zykov was the first to hear of the old man's passing. A quiet and peaceful end in the night, the doctor said. Better than he deserved, according to many, but Zykov wouldn't hear of that. Today would be a day for mourning, for whatever the chairman's faults, he was still the liberator of Western Russia. Regardless of whether the people would accept the truth, Miletiy Zykov would have it spoken.\n\nWhen the time came to bury Vlasov, it came on a cold, rainy day. First, there was the procession through Samara, with a guard of honor flanking the general's hearse. Thousands lined the streets, as was their duty, but stayed no longer than expected. Second came the service, after Zykov, Bunyachenko, Oktan and Meandrov bore the coffin up the steps of the rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Savior. All spoke in turn: Meandrov of his victories, Oktan of his strength, Bunyachenko of his dedication. Last was Zykov, who spoke of the general's dream. For a brief few minutes, the officers and civilians packing the pews forgot their treasonous origins, thinking only of the brilliant tapestry woven by the mysterious man from Ukraine.\n\nThe flag of the ROA flew at half-mast from Samara to Arkhangelsk, the blue cross reminding all beneath it of who had given them a second chance at sovereignty. Though they were few, there were those who saluted of their own accord, doffing their hats in a moment of silence for the passing of a humble giant.\n\nMost of Russia would never forgive Andrey Vlasov for his actions. But Zykov, as he sat the general's old office and raised a solitary toast to the old general, expressed his thanks - for standing by his people to the end."
 SAM.36.a: "The night is darkest before the dawn."
 SAM.37.t: "A Plan for Power"
 SAM.37.d: "Deep within the shadows of his office, Mikhail Oktan smiled. Years of work had finally paid off. Years of gaining the trust of the doddering fool Vlasov, of buttering up his fellow officers until they all danced to his tune. Still, he had to concede that his hold on the ROA was not absolute. Bunyachenko held much respect among them, his actions in the West Russian War had managed to cement his place as the leader of the ROA in truth, if not rank. Then there was Zykov, the spineless worm. He held sway over the people of Samara, his ideas of democracy and freedom for the people were poison in their minds. Such ideas had no place in the Russia he would rule, such as it was.\n\nWhile Vlasov still drew breath, he would need to tread carefully. While he was foolish enough to trust him with the Deputy-Chairmanship, he was still much too popular amongst the ROA's ranks for Oktan to push forward all of his plans. For now, he would need to be patient. Just as he had throughout the Great Patriotic War, the West Russian War, and the chaotic years that followed.\n\nHowever, that did not mean he could not act against his rivals. Vlasov had given him wide latitude for change within Samara and he intended to mold the ROA into a more preferable form. Now, he had a choice. He could risk the repercussions and move against Bunyachenko and Zykov immediately. It would come with risks but, at the same time, it could remove the biggest obstacles to his power right away. On the other hand, he could work with them for the time being. It would allow him the use of their resources and influence, but it would also allow them to plot against him unimpeded."
 SAM.37.a: "They have to be dealt with, here and now!"
 SAM.38.t: "Rise of the Iron President"
 SAM.38.d: "The old man's iron will had given out not too long after the Western Russian unification. Aides had found Chairman Vlasov in his room after he had failed to wake up one morning. Three days of mourning had been declared across newly liberated lands. A few genuinely upset citizens had thronged the general's coffin. Vlasov had been admired by a few across Russia. His relentless drive to free Russia from the communist menace had been admired by many. In the dark days of the West Russian War, areas liberated by the Chairman's men had been spared the brutal retribution killing of the Wehrmacht. During the dark decade that followed, he had done as much as possible to shield the people of Samara from his former German backers.\n\nBut the mourners were far outnumbered by a mass of stone-faced civilians. Whether secretly angry or entirely apathetic, General Bunyachenko could not tell. He knew that an overwhelming majority of citizens thought Vlasov the lowest of lowest in all of Russian history. A pathetic dog of the German occupier, that had led Russian troops in a fratricidal war to crush the resurgent Red army. Soldiers with live ammunition had covered the funeral procession, lest rioters try to smash the old Chairman's coffin.\n\nReading a hastily prepared speech, Bunyachenko felt out of his element, standing as he did in front of the sea of blank faces. He had always wondered why the detested Vlasov had lived day after day in hope of redemption. Now the wave of cold contempt threatened to drown KONR's new leader. Russia stood on the brink of unification for the first time in decades. A fact one could hardly imagine from the assembled citizen, too tired even for despair at the take-over of their land by former German collaborators.\n\nBunyachenko mumbled the last few words of the funerary oration. His officer colleagues led the applause. With one last look at Vlasov, the new leader of liberated Western Russia marched off the podium. His wish to be alone for the rest of the day would go unfulfilled."
 SAM.38.a: "Perhaps Vlasov will be missed."
 SAM.39.t: "Enthusiastic Iconoclasm"
 SAM.39.d: "Many years prior, the soldiers of the Russian Liberation Army had marched, and fought, alongside those who proudly flew the now universally-known symbols of National Socialism. Today, however, they were destroying those symbols. With great enthusiasm.\n\nEven to the often morally-questionable membership of the ROA - though that was improving under the leadership of Miletiy Zykov - the 'Aryan Brotherhood' had been seen as little more than an almost inconceivable aberration. What was more, the stories of the few who escaped their lands told of nothing but abject horrors being inflicted upon those unfortunate enough to live under their 'government.'\n\nAnd, so, when the Army had marched upon the Brotherhood in pursuit of its goals of regional unification, none had harbored any sympathies for them. They had fought fanatically, but were horrifically outnumbered and, in due time, fell like every other enemy. Upon entering Perm, however, the true work began.\n\nOrders had come from Samara - everything that could, in any fashion, be considered to represent either the Brotherhood or National Socialism was to be destroyed. Utterly. The soldiers, having seen ample proof of the previously rumoured horrors, took to this order with a furious zeal, and very soon statues, signs, artwork, and other artefacts of all kinds that represented the cruelty of the city's former masters began to disappear.\n\nWith any luck, many of the soldiers fervently hoped, the memories of what they represented would soon fade away. Forever."

That successor has been informed of Vlasov's passing, and the continuity and transition procedures previously written by Vlasov's office have been put into effect.\n\nA complicated man, Vlasov leaves behind an equally complicated legacy of both collaboration as well as liberation, and it is not clear how his past actions will be remembered in future years. Regardless of such future perceptions however, the state he founded in the aftermath of the West Russian War provided us with the foundation necessary to achieve regional unification, and this should not, and will not, be forgotten.\n\nVlasov's successor now faces the daunting task of not only strengthening our control over a region where many perceive us as illegitimate, but also preparing us for the conflicts to come as we pursue our ultimate goal of liberating all the peoples of Russia - from Europe to the Far East.\n\nWe hope they rise to meet the challenge."

The path to end the mutiny and prevent the implosion of the ROA into civil war was engineered masterfully by the veteran propagandist, who seemed to perfectly recall the tenets that Macchiavelli preached centuries ago. Zykov had bribed all who could be bought, talked down those who could be talked, and threatened violence upon those could not be satisfied with either. The combination worked, if only barely. Armed confrontation was reserved to a few hardcore mutineers, who utterly refused surrender. All of these facts, and an aura of relief brough by them, were swirling around the heads of the committee which Zykov now stood in front of.\n\nThe enigmatic orator had already given a cursory briefing on the situation and it's fallout. However, his coup-de-grace was yet to come. \"As I'm sure all of you are aware, it was the perfidious Mikhail Oktan, who organized and financed this mutiny against the authority of our dear chairman.\" For most, that was a surprise. The truth of the situation was that Oktan had nothing to do with the revolt - but Zykov knew an opportunity when he saw one. \"Indeed it is clear, at least to me, that we can no longer tolerate rat-like insubordinates in our ranks, no matter how entrenched in favors they may be.\" Zykov looked around this room, his cool gaze analyzing each member. He was confident in their vote. One by one, each consented to Oktan's arrest. \"Very well. If it is the will of the committee, and our dear chairman, I will gladly order the arrest of Mikhail Oktan and his subsequent trial.\"\n\nOktan would not, in fact, get a trial. After his arrest, during which he made no small protest, he was taken to a small barn near the outskirts of Samara, and given a sentencing, summarily being shot. His body was burned in the hut's backyard, and that was the end of Mikhail Oktan."

After all, he did not have the military resolve of Bunyachenko, nor the connections of Oktan. But the propagandist, as they had all derisively referred to him, had proven far more resilient, and ruthless, than they had thought him capable of.\n\nFirst, he had taken action against the insurrectionist soldiers. Then he had done so against their officers. And then, turning his attention to them, he had issued an ultimatum, one so common in contemporary Russia - surrender or die.\n\nMany of their once-comrades already had, marching to interrogation and imprisonment. But they had not. They had refused, they had continued the fight, and they had, very quickly, lost. Zykov's now-compliant soldiers had pursued them as they fled, and even now they could hear the trucks and boots outside.\n\nAs one of the barred windows to street level was broken with a resounding crash, a bundle of grenades was thrown in, and a moment later what was left of the civilian resistance was no more."

In bad times, Zykov's steely determination explained how the long suffering democratic faction had weathered ten years of abuse from various factions in Samara.\n\nToday's Zykov reminded Bunyachenko of seeing himself in a mirror. The former journalist did not walk into the office so much as he tumbled in, pushed around by the weight of events.\n\n\"Zykov. Good to see you.\" The democratic activist began to speak, only for the chairman to cut him off. \"No, please let me continue. Right now, a tidal wave of shit is threatening to wash away our progress.

You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces.\"\n\n\"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the Officer Committee? I should go see them directly.\"\n\nBunyachenko smiled a little. Something of Zykov's old bravado remained. That was good. \"The Officer Committee are useless, tired old men. On that, you, Oktan and I agree. No, Zykov, you will argue your case with me. You are an eloquent fellow. If you convince me that you can be of use, perhaps you'll see some of your dreams realized. I'm in the market for new... associates.\"\n\nZykov's eyes shone a little brighter. Or had it been just an illusion?

The officers and those judged too radical had been kept on death's row long enough for fellow travellers to the other side to arrive. ROA officers all, corrupt to the bone and kindling for rebellion to a man.\n\nOne of the officers had not travelled far to meet his fate. Hours before recapturing the village, orders had come through for the man's arrest. Citing his insubordination and corruption, the men from Bunyachenko's entourage had relieved the commander of his post and tossed him into a holding cell. None among the soldiers doubted his guilt. The astute few noted the disgraced officer's tie to Oktan's faction. These were bad days for ambitious men within the army of liberation that did not bend the knee to the Officer Committee.\n\nSedated by defeat and by an extra set of emergency rations, the villagers crowded mutely around the execution grounds.

Before Bunyachenko could even ask who was interrupting him, four of his personal guards entered, their weapons drawn. Rising from his desk, Bunyachenko asked, \"What is going on?\" a tone of suspicion was confirmed as he looked to Popov and Antonov, who had since stood up and drawn their sidearms.\n\n\"Sergey Bunyachenko,\" Antonov started, \"The Officer Committee has placed you under arrest following an investigation into corruption and nepotism charges.

Together, and under the command of those who had recruited them, he and other volunteers in the militia soon found themselves equipped with surprisingly modern weapons and tasked with holding the city centre against a Vlasovite formation.\n\nMaksim was surprised at how easy it was. The Vlasovites seemed disunited, and he was certain that he had heard shots from their positions, down the street from his own barricade. As the days passed, however, he grew confused. Why wasn't the militia advancing? Why was the commander, the man who had spoken so passionately about revolt and had somehow secured such high-quality weapons, now just sitting in the command post?\n\nHis confusion was only heightened when the commander suddenly ordered them to stockpile their weapons and assemble in formation before himself and his hand-picked officers. And then, as a car drove up and a man emerged, a man Maksim recognized as the local black marketeer and a functionary of the hated General Oktan, it all became, at last and far, far too late, abundantly clear.\n\nA satchel was handed to the commander, the commander gestured to his officers, and the officers raised their weapons. Maksim managed only a half-step before the bullet pierced his skull.

Nor the starving peasants begging to hold a rifle in exchange for some food of the dark days in Samara. These recruits were looking to join the ROA and take place in the further liberation of Russia. Of course, for every voluntary man ten more had to be drafted. Yet, something of a change in atmosphere could be detected.\n\nDifferent too were the officers. Many were recently promoted, taking up spots once occupied by old, bitter or desperate men. Out here on the border, so close to the Urals, the new generation of ROA officers prepared for the great crusade east.\n\nMuch remained to be done. New guns, new tanks, better training standards. Yet Nikolai found himself hopeful. Changes were coming, and the ROA's enemies were right to fear the coming war."

 SAM.51.desc: "The dingy, dusk-filled bar was an odd choice for a meeting location, thought Major Evgeny Sobol. As he descended the stairs from the entrance into the bar located in the cellar of an old building in the city and spotted his American contact however, he understood exactly why the location had been chosen. Sobol was a man of the military, ultimately, and his assignment to meet with the American Central Intelligence Agency was because years ago, he had experience dealing with Soviet intelligence. \"An oxymoron, I know\", he liked to joke with other ROA members. There was nothing humorous in the man who sat at a table in the back, poorly illuminated by a combination of candles and old lights. He had a grizzled look about him, a man who clearly hadn't gotten a chance to shave in a few days, some rough scruff growing into a full-fledged beard. As he approached the table, the individual looked up and slowly rose, shaking Sobol's hand.\n\n\"Utkin\". He introduced himself in flawless Russian, albeit with the accent of an English speaker. \"Parents fled the revolution\", he explained further, referencing the Soviets. \"Grew up speaking Russian at home, English in school. It's good to meet you, Colonel Maksimov.\"\n\n'Maksimov?' Thought Sobol. The other man thought he was speaking to Sobol's commanding officer. \"Major Sobol, actually. Colonel Maksimov is my superior.\", the Russian officer responded, taking a seat across from Utkin, trying to ignore the look of disappointed disinterest in the spook's expression. \"It's good to finally sit down with you, and discuss our future with America.\"\n\n\"And what future would that be, major?\" the agent responded.\n\nThe question took Sobol aback - he had barely been briefed on the meeting, outside of the fact of who he was meeting and what they were discussing. That much became obvious when Sobol stumbled over his words. \"Ah, well, recognition. Support-\", Sobol responded. As he attempted to go on, he was interrupted by the American.\n\n\"Listen. Not that anyone's asking me, but I don't really care about your organization's reputation. I think you're doing God's work. But some of my higher-ups don't feel the same. A lot of the CIA remembers your organization as it was years ago. My being on the ground here doesn't change that. Between you and me?\" Utkin leaned in. \"You guys have a lot of rebranding to do. Until then, it's going to be very hard for me to convince my handlers of anything.\"\n\nSobol attempted to protest. \"Isn't it clear that we're not interested in collaboration anymore? It was only ever a means to an end. Believe me, our leaders are planning retribution against the Germans on a massive scale\". It was no use, however. A few vodkas later, Sobol left the bar with very little to tell his superior."

However, Mikhail Oktan was far from the typical statesman. He revelled in the shadows, likening himself to a puppet master at play, jangling around those who he bought or blackmailed as if they were marionettes, setting up corrupt deals and meeting wealthy magnates. In a dingy, run-down bar, where Oktan frequently held court, the type of place where you had to take three alleys from the main street to get there, a special session was taking place.\n\nEver since he had attained his position at the top of the ROA's leadership, Oktan had been frequenting his old contacts less and less, relying on his more trusted and thuggish cronies to tie up loose ends and ensure both compliance and loyalty among those who still had their uses. However, music played loudly, and the raucous nature of his little backalley hideaway betrayed his presence. Sitting at his table that he had specifically made up for himself, seemingly sitting court among the bar patrons, and flanked on all sides by the scariest bodyguards he could buy, Oktan faced a trio of less-than-savoury Russians who lived beyond the Urals. The three men called themselves the Goncharov Brothers, and while none of them were related, each one was nastier than the next. One, a trader from Nizhny Novgorod who dabbled in less savory trades than guns, the second an ashamed \"made man\" from the thief's territory, and the third a disgraced middling officer from the city of Tyumen accused by Kaganovich's commissars as corrupt. Each one of them had fled from their lives, fleeing stark justice, only to redefine themselves as smugglers who worked for the most powerful, or anyone else who would pay more. The trio had made their first fortune smuggling contraband eastwards, across the Urals. They were still under his employ, but they had been called to talk to the new Grand Marshal, now that he was fully in control of Western Russia. After ensuring that all three of them had some of the nicest vodka in the joint, Oktan opened.\n\n\"Gentlemen. I'm sure that all three of you have heard about my promotion.\"\n\n\"But of course, Grand Marshal. A big step up, that's for sure.\" the man from Tyumen stated.\n\n\"Then I won't have to remind you of how important you are to me... now more than ever. And how vital it is to make sure you stay important.\"\n\nNerves gave way to alcohol, however, as Oktan and his smugglers drank the night away, each party assured of their continued prosperity."

 SAM.53.t: "An End to Martial Law"
 SAM.53.desc: "Shuvaya was a place that had become used to being a small dot on the map that local warlords fought over. But as the Russian states began to coalesce, its \"importance\", if it ever had one, was beginning to be forgotten. It had been a key location for an anti-ROA revolt by old-time Pro-Soviet guerrillas, unwilling to accept the primacy of the ROA. As such the village and its inhabitants were treated incredibly harshly when the counterrevolutionary army swept in and slaughtered the partisans that resisted them. The winds of change were clearly afoot, however. An ROA soldier nailed an announcement on the dilapidated bulletin board in the center of the town. As he slunked off, the villagers who had seen him putting up the announcement quickly gathered around the piece of paper, expecting more bad news. They would be surprised - \"Martial law to end in one week\", the pamphlet claimed. \"Village council rule to resume the following\". The group was positively shocked as the announcement continued to detail the reach of council rule - which had never been witnessed in Shuvaya - as well as the various responsibilities and powers that were associated with the councils. The pamphlet described council rule as a contract between the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia and each individual village council, where both worked to better themselves and the nation. It was a surprisingly fair deal for the Shuvayan peasants, who had so far been poorly treated by the ROA.\n\nSome of the most skeptical thought that it was a trap - but it became clear that the order was genuine in a week's time when, true to their word, the local ROA garrison withdrew from the town and ended martial law. As the last truck drove down the dirt path back towards civilization, the people of Shuvaya found themselves, temporarily, without government. It was a strange feeling, even for the youngest of villagers. For the first time in a long time, there was peace, they had just been willingly granted autonomy by the soldiers that they once hated. Like a deer in headlights, the people seemed to be stunned. But that very afternoon a group of the most experienced, and, in general, the oldest residents of the village set up a council to prepare themselves for self-government. This council would become one of hundreds, varying in size and importance, to be created by Zykov's relaxation of emergency rule."

Since then, however, the ROA had resumed its usual mix of peace time training and high level politicking.\n\nNot that much successful politicking had taken place in the colonel's life of late. Doors had begun closing to him. Everyone within the Officer Committee seemed on guard. Many men had died after the mutinies for suspected corruption. Their replacements had been hand picked by chairman Bunyachenko.\n\nThe chairman himself was a different man. Once eternally listless, Commander Bunyachenko spent his days doing paperwork in his office, and his evening drinking with other officers. A quiet and respected officer, but not one to show any initiative. Nowadays, determination had replaced melancholy in the general's posture.\n\nRumors circulated of the Chairman calling for a constitutional convention. Many in the old officer clique assumed this would be the perfect opportunity to present a shopping list to Commander Bunyachenko to make the Officer Committee eternally important in the new era. But the colonel was no longer sure Commander Bunyachenko would not have an agenda of his own. Times were changing, they were changing extremely quickly."

 SAM.55.desc: "The seemingly-ancient troop truck surged up one hill and down the next, with each small incline or pothole feeling as if it would be the truck's last. The beast had seen the chaos of the 50's, survived the West Russian War, was captured three different times by three different warlords, before finally ending up in the reserve arsenal of the Russian Liberation Army. It had been doled out to Vadim Kovalevsky so that he and the garrison that was assigned to him could make their way to Yerykly.\n\nKovalevsky, a junior officer of the ROA, was quickly bought by Oktan soon after he received his post, mostly because of Kovalevsky's drinking problem and penchant for violence where needed. He played his role during the tumultuous time between Vlasov's death and Oktan's assumption of power, and because of that, he had been parcelled out a small village and its environs as a reward. Kovalevsky, poorly read and fat off of the luxuries provided by his master, was more than happy, after a few vodkas, of course, to accept the \"gift\" that Oktan had provided him. The sobering reality of the situation only set in when he was woken up the next morning and told that he was to report to his new fiefdom.\n\nYerykly was a village where the primary export was poverty. The streets were dirt on a good day, mud on most, and the most exciting thing that had happened here since the end of the terror bombings was that one of the cows had given birth to twins. Now, Kovalevsky, who had grown up a refugee from the Germans to the West of Samara, knew desperate times. As he stepped off of his troop truck, he found his welcome completely ignored by most of the village's inhabitants, who continued on with their daily lives. Kovalevsky had a flash, for just a brief moment - the place, somehow, reminded him of home. But as reality sank in, he knew that the relative comfort of Samara was long behind him, and his faint smile turned to grimace. The only consolation that he had was, for now, this entire village lived and died on his decree."

 SAM.56.desc: "The Constitutional Convention for the Provisional Commissariat of Western Russia was of utter chaos - Zykov hadn't just invited important ROA magnates, but also hardcore democrats, some of whom were former members of the Komi Republic, ex-Tsarists who had operated under Vladmir III's controversial regime, cautious reformers, drawn from both Zykov's supporters and beyond. He had, perhaps most controversially, invited a series of left-leaning politicians as well - those who had definitely been members of the CPSU at one point or another, some of whom even utterly refused to renounce their allegiance to a leftist ideology. The convention - attended by 59 members plus Zykov himself, had been passionately arguing with itself for quite some time. Not just over the nature of the constitution, but the future of Russia as a whole. The only thing that kept the delegates in check were reminders that their participation was contingent on keeping the convention civil, as well as the several armed ROA guards that lined the large conference room.\n\nZykov intermittently participated, but also went about various other duties of state as well, and was thus often absent for a lot of the debates. In his stead, a secretary took what notes he could and sent them off for review by the chairman. Additionally, any changes or proposed clauses to be put in to the constitution were brought to Zykov personally, in front of the convention, where he would give his often-critical opinion on the proposed additions, which tended to be well received by the voting members of the convention - especially considering how many of the delegates were suspiciously oft in agreement with Zykov's \"decrees\", as some more independent-minded delegates began to seethingly call them.\n\nZykov read over the newest proposed provision for the constitution. Clearly, it had been drafted by the convention's more radical elements - the words that stood out to him were \"fully representative democracy\". The entire clause called for that and more. Something that Zykov was personally not interested in, but also that even considering implementing something like that would not only alienate the officers of the ROA, but perhaps even induce them to revolt. A dangerous consideration for the chairman who often felt he walked a razor's edge.\n\n\"This part here, it's unacceptable to the convention. Democracy indeed, but the term 'fully representative' cannot be expected within the realities of Russia.\"\n\nAnd with that, the provision was discarded, the convention continued their bickering."

The ROA's grandees expected to enshrine their power and influence in the new nation's DNA, to ensure a permanent high status to the ROA's supreme officers. To do this, they relied on the Chairman's favor. After all, had Bunyachenko not been a creature of the committee all these years?\n\nThe chairman grimaced. A lot of things had changed since the start of the Russian unification wars. The death of Vlasov, Oktan's quixotic mutinies, the widespread partisan unrest. The ROA did not scale well to its new role as both army and government of an entire nation. Bunyachenko had called on industrialists, on mayors and commune leaders, on lower ranking ROA officers to attend the convention as part of his coalition. It was necessary to render the Officer Committee irrelevant if a new, strong Russia was to begin. A strong Russia, led by a strongman with almost universal support, ready to enter the modern era.

Decked in the traditional ROA's officer garb and a dark grey trench coat draped over his shoulders, the medals that he had awarded himself seemed comically large on his chest. He shook hands and saluted all of those who greeted him, and espoused his charismatic, dynamic exterior for the whole convention to see. It almost seemed more a procession than an entrance, but after all, the Grand Marshal did preside over the convention.\n\nAs he took his place at the front of the gathered delegates, he observed those who had earned a place at the convention: from the military wing, his most trusted and skilled generals, those who had earned a place at the Grand Marshal's side. Beside them sat the more junior officers, the ones that he couldn't name, but that he, and his trusted senior comrades, had seen fit to bestow administrative responsibilities to large tracts of land in Western Russia. He may not have known their names, but clearly their hearts were in the right place. Next to them sat the noticeably smaller civilian wing.\n\nThese were the real question marks in Oktan's mind - he had his trusted aides put feelers out in Samara and other large cities under the control of the KONR for any \"dynamic individual\" who had the money, manpower, and desire to cooperate closely with the Grand Marshal and his plans for the future. These were industrialists, technocrats, disgraced former politicians. Each one of them with an interest and, to Oktan, a payoff. Looking over all those assembled, Oktan began to talk, his raspy, but powerful voice booming through the room, made louder by the ancient microphone he was speaking into.\n\n\"My friends, thank you for joining me here today, in the true spirit of a Russian state!\" Respectful clapping followed, before he continued. \"As most of you know, we all have been working tirelessly to forge a Russia independent of the communists, who have been doing nothing but causing issues for our land for decades. With this convention, we have taken a massive step towards destroying their movement completely. And once we do, we can begin looking at turning our Russia into a rich nation... one where all will be without want, free to help forge a strong identity and forever prevent the slide of our people back into the depravity of communism.

It was made public that in both federal and provincial courts, that there would be a mixture of civilian and military judges, the latter only making up about a third of the judiciary. The move was controversial, but ultimately in line with the Chairman's vision for a democratic Russia that prioritized the needs of its citizenry. Zykov, still always careful to walk the razor's edge between his vision and the military's reactionism, ensured that those appointed to their respective positions, civilian or military, were in his pocket. That way, at the very least, they could make their case for Zykov and defend his choices to their respective supporters. Of course, the civilian judges and the military judges both had their own agendas - after all, everyone wanted something. But the aim was that, despite their affiliation, they would remain loyal to the Chairman.\n\n\"Welcome to your new office, judge.\" Anatoly Ignatov's brother said, emphasizing his new title as the pair of them entered into the large room. A comfortable area, the office would be the headquarters for Ignatov's new job - that of judge. He had been handpicked by the ROA following the chairman's insistence on forming a coherent and comprehensive judiciary. Despite the fact that he was a civilian, he met with Zykov's deputies, who, apparently, were enamored with the now-judge's ideas of justice and sensibility. Of course, the position wasn't without responsibilities, nor was Ignatov's conscience clean; the former community leader did have to make some deals with the deputies to ensure that he got the position. This of course, included an unspoken provision that he was to be loyal to the chairman, and by extension, the entire committee. But this was a small price to pay for the position that he now found himself in. As he explored the room, his brother, in awe at the place, asked him a question. \"So where will you start? How does this even work?\" Anatoly thought for a bit before responding.\n\n\"I guess we'll find out.\""

These will be enacted by a new system of tribunals staffed with former ROA soldiers. The supreme court of the republic itself will be stacked with men loyal to the chairman.

After he had finished his lunch, he had dismissed all of his meetings for the rest of the day - except one, his aide reminded him. He couldn't possibly postpone the meeting of prominent military and civilian officials to finalize the judiciary system in the Provisional Commissariat. Especially, as the aide had pointed out, that the officers who he was meeting with, he had sent them out to their fiefs but had so soon recalled them.\n\nReluctantly, and with a belly fuller than he could remember, he sat down with the eight individuals, five military and three civilian, to hash out and complete the judicial code for the Russia that he envisioned. Despite his lethargic outlook, he soon took to the task with his normal charisma, cracking jokes and living up to his image as the most sociable head of state west of the Urals.\n\n\"So, let's get down to business, shall we?\" He asked those gathered, laziness rapidly dissipating in favour of excitement. The Grand Marshal laid out a number of documents, which were passed around the group. \"As you can see, we're looking at a dual military-civilian system. The military governor of a province appoints a political chief, which deals with any civilian case in the district, but can be appealed or vetoed by the military governor. Cases won't be able to be taken federally, the military governor is the highest say.\" Oktan shifted in his chair, looking more towards the officers. \"Military disputes will be handled federally. A group of officers will serve in positions as judges and will be handpicked by me. A judge can be removed if the majority of the judges vote them off, or if I want them off. I'd pick a successor. These disputes and proceedings would be similar to military tribunals, complete with your pick of various legal provisions.\" Looking directly at the officers, he emphasized, \"Remember, I take care of our boys.\""

Make it its own district, there's no way we can predict what'll happen there.\"\n\nToday, Zykov's vision of a unicameral system of parliament to represent \"all the peoples of Russia\" began its first step towards realization. Zykov announced the formation of a parliament following general elections during a grand ceremony in Samara, where apparently, \"all free Russians\" would be able to vote. The reaction to this announcement was mixed among the people of Russia.\n\nIn places like Samara, which had known ROA rule for so long, it was a welcome relief to military rule, and Yedinstvo, the political party representing the ROA, candidates were projected to win in landslides. In other places, the news of elections were more tentative.\n\nThe gentry of Syktyvkar, those who survived its conquest, were cynical and suspicious of the elections, and immediately pointed out the great degree of gerrymandering that had gone on in certain areas. This gerrymandering, likely, they claimed, all but ensured the victory of the Yedinstvo in various areas to make sure that its interests were represented in the government. But Zykov's official representatives denied this claim vehemently.\n\nIn the north, where the Soviet remnants once reigned supreme, feelings were ambivalent. For the ideological hardliners, those who fled with the front, rigorous campaigning for candidates as left as was allowed occurred, but many others, natives, cared little. Regardless, the winds of change were blowing, and even the most ignorant Russian peasant couldn't escape Zykov's careful, calculated democratization."

Their counter proposal of a legislature appointed by the Officer Committee brought the convention to a stand still for some time until chairman Bunyachenko brought along a new proposal of a bicameral legislature. An elected lower chamber would keep accountable an appointed upper house.\n\nCynics could accuse this scheme of favoring the Chairman's own interests in the long run. The democratic lower house's extremely limited power would impose few restrictions on the actions of the senate. A realist, however, would see how astute the Chairman's compromise solution was in threading the needle between various interest groups.\n\nIn return for Bunyachenko's partial support for their proposal, the Officer Committee agreed to let him appoint many of the initial senators for five year terms. The list of candidates being brought forward by the Chairman's faction is expected to contain loyalists to the President, technocrats and industrialists willing to enact the President's rumored radical reforms.

Entering from the front, a long red carpet led from the oaken double doors to the large, ancient desk that the Grand Marshal sat at. Portraits of great Russians, including Oktan himself, adorned the walls, but there was a conspicuous lack of Vlasov's presence. Throughout most of the day, Oktan and his closest confidants caroused themselves and those that they met with to the point that the Grand Marshal could barely remember everything that he had done and all who he had met with.\n\n\"Clearly our dear, departed leader was doing this all wrong!\" Oktan exclaimed to uproarious laughter, exactly when Grigory Lagunov stepped into the room. The officer was a newcomer to the ROA's senior ranks, and was considered a bit of a teetotaler. His uniform was always immaculate and he never slouched, nor did he ever drink or smoke.\n\n\"You wanted to see me, Grand Marshal?\"\n\nOktan made a welcoming gesture, practically begging the man to join them. \"Yes, yes! Come in, please! I wanted to see you, Colonel Lagunov,\" Oktan's face dropped his smile, and he turned deadpan. \"About something very, very serious.\" Oktan and his company watched as the color drained from the colonel's face.\n\nThey gave it a few seconds, allowing the officer, who surely thought that he was about to be shot, to advance towards them before they burst out into laughter. \"Look at your face!\" the Grand Marshal cackled. \"No, no, nothing like that...\" He said, calming himself down after a fit of laughter. \"The Committee would like you to... well, grant you the governorship of the province of Nizhny Novgorod!\"\n\nLagunov, clearly not having recovered from the fright, wasn't quite sure what to say. \"A... a governorship?\" He repeated. Oktan rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Come now, don't be so suspicious. Is this because of the joke? I'm sorry. Yes, we want you to govern the region. You'll be subject to the federal government, of course, which means that you'll owe taxes, as well as conscription and equipment levies. But you can make your own laws, within reason of course, so long as they only apply within the borders of the area that you control! How's that sound?\"\n\nThe colonel was taken aback. He had been smart enough to keep his head down during Oktan's accession, but he had never expected this. \"I... well, I must accept.\" Lagunov took a drink with the officers for the first time in a long time, and he left the \"meeting\" satisfied, knowing that he would be presiding over his hometown."

This factory, like its sister facilities all across the territory of the Provisional Commissariat, would be working day-in and day-out to produce weapons and ammunition for the ever-hungry ROA. Owned and operated by the government, these arms factories, once seen as a dreadful deal by a number of local residents, had become beacons of job stability and good pay as a result of government investment into making working conditions and wages livable, at the very least. Zykov had worked for a long time to ensure a good, stable industrial base for the ROA back when it was scratching out a meager existence around Samara, and later once he was the guiding hand behind Vlasov's policies. Now that he was at the helm of the Provisional Commissariat, a coherent, effective, and most importantly, fair, industrial policy had been put in place by Zykov and his administration.\n\nThe military industry would be almost entirely state-controlled: The line between the military-industrial sector and the ROA itself seemed to be distinct, if blurry at times. This way the state could guide the necessities of military production while also ensuring that the needs of the soldiers are met. The civilian sector, however, was almost immediately privatised. The government sold off a number of factories that had been seized during the ROA's conquest of Western Russia, and those they couldn't sell, they simply handed out to conglomerates and corporations. Working conditions were exponentially better than they had been a mere few years ago, and while a civilian factory job was far from perfect, it was, at least, stable."

To the assembled industrialists, ROA logistic officers and technocrats of all stripes, Bunyachenko brought forward two objectives as well as a timeframe: Russian unity and world class industry, both before the end of the decade.\n\nThe Bunyachenko of times past might have been cowed momentarily by the wave of opposition in the room. The new Chairman, however, silenced the feverish complaints that such a project could not be realized. Had the Japanese not carved an empire of steel in Manchuria where once only dusty steppe could be found? Had not the damn Bukharinists developed the Central Siberian heavy industry in such a time span?\n\nCombining a modern central financial system and interlocking shareholders, a select set of industrial concerns would be expanded horizontally and vertically into economical juggernauts dubbed kombinats. The presence of allies of the government in key financial institutions would be used to feed loyal businesses, and prevent hostile takeovers by national or international rivals. In preparation for liberation of the rest of Russia, military supplying contracts would provide initial fuel for the rise of these kombinats.\n\nBunyachenko's speech concluded, the chairman stood and answered questions. Invited industrialists bombarded him with questions and concerns, initially. In time, however, suggestions and ideas began outweighing negativity. Here was the opportunity of a century for ambitious men of the room."

The Grand Marshal sat behind his desk, a beautiful mahogany thing smuggled in from Italy and listened to the simpering of a small group of officers. They were the governors of more eastward territories in his slice of Russia, and as such felt bolder in defying him.\n\nFinally, he had enough. Pressing a small buzzer under his desk, his personal guards stepped through the door, guns drawn. The officers stepped back in shock, some went for their sidearms but their compatriots stopped them before they could do anything stupid.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I did not want to resort to such... direct measures, but if you will not listen to reason then you give me no choice. You WILL accept these new measures, you WILL continue to supply the tithes I am due, and if you comply, you WILL live to see your lands again.

The west of our nation has been united under the administration of the Provisional Commissariat, which aims to protect the Russian nation and all of her people from the dangers of communism and Tsarism, each of which would bring about disastrous consequences for our nation. Instead, a state free of the stain of leftism or monarchism has been established. Our goal, the goal of the Provisional Commissariat, is to protect the Russian people from the dangers of these ideologies and extremism in general, as well as to forge a strong state, free of foreign influence; we must prevent another tragedy like the West Russian War!\"\n\nThe content of the pamphlet had been as baffling to the village's priest as it was to the individual who had picked it up after seeing that it had been dropped by a plane flying above, heading east for a bit before circling back and heading west, dropping pamphlets as they flew. The natural barrier of the Ural Mountains had acted as a blocker for news, heading both westwards and eastwards. The only exception to that was the Republic of Zlatoust, but even then their merchants tended to keep all non-essential information close to their chest. However, as proto-states coalesced in Western Russia and east of the Urals, it became increasingly inevitable that there would be communication and interaction between the two areas. The disconnect between the expectations of interactions by the Committee and the realities of the situation to the east, however, caused their pamphlets to cause more confusion among communities than inspiration and hope for an oncoming \"liberation\"."

The pair, alongside the rest of their squad, had finally been taken off of frontline action in a standard troop rotation, and Volkov found himself oddly empty. To his surprise, he had enjoyed his time on the frontlines, even during the bloody unification wars against the Tsarists, communists, and others. He had felt a pride in his chest, as if he was doing something good for the first time in his life, and that he was working towards something greater than himself. But rearguard duty was sort of boring to the young corporal. As he pulled off his new boots, he noted how much comfier they were than the ones he had been issued when he first joined up. Storing his assault rifle, he recalled the days when he had been given: a German-made Kar98k, the bolt of which seemed to jam after every other shot. Now what he - and his entire squad, for that matter - were issued could seemingly be dragged through the mud and still work. The changes were incredibly apparent for the young man, who had witnessed vast change in his relatively short tenure. As he sat back down on his bunk, Pavlovsky, across from him, was reading. With change in his mind, he asked the grizzled veteran, \"Say, Pavlovsky, what do you think of everything that's changed?\"\n\nA small grin crept over Pavlovsky's face as he turned his head to face Volkov and closed his book. \"I think that the changes are pretty crazy. If you told me, three year ago, that I'd be sitting here with a belly full of food, clothes that haven't been worn by three other people before me, and a gun that works, I'd have told you that you're crazy.\" The man was notoriously laconic, but Volkov always pressed him for more. \"Have you ever seen anything like this before? I mean... When the army was forced to fight with the Germans.\"\n\nSilence, before Pavlovsky's response came. \"Oh, God, I can't remember, it seems.\" He ran a hand through his silver scruff. \"I can barely even remember the equipment they gave us. The missions we were given. Complete suicide, they were. You'd be lucky to get their assault rifle, the StG. Usually you'd have old rifles, the ones that... I guess their own soldiers couldn't use?\" There was a pause, the old soldier sighing. \"There are so few of us left from then. But I think that every one of us is grateful for what we have now. Besides, now that we're free from the grip of the Germans, well, I finally feel pride in fighting for something other than revenge.\""

Now, the fruit of reforms were on display as the new ROA prepared its final set of field exercises.\n\nHordes of conscripted light infantry prepared for battle, kept hungry by constant discipline and motivated by endless propaganda. Weak, degenerate cowards held the rest of Russia, and there was a fortune in the making for bold soldiers like them. Behind them marched the veterans of the ROA, hardened by years of struggle. Only the toughest had made it this far, and this kernel of elite troops would be the anvil upon which the enemy would be shattered. Behind them further, new vehicles. Everyday new tanks rolled out of production lines and into ROA garrisons. The ROA had won Western Russia's industry, and now this industry would protect the brave men that would liberate Russia.\n\nThe grim enthusiasm of this army closely approximated, but did not quite resemble the ROA of old. Resigned professionalism had given way to bloody enthusiasm. The officer corps, once united by a dream of something bigger, now fought for glory and loot. The upcoming wars might very well be the ROA's last hurrah as a disciplined formation, as the Chairman's greed had corroded his army into a set of savage, brutal riders from the stepe."

This informal network, known as the \"Shepchushchaya Galereya\", or whispering gallery, had become the paramount organization for intelligence gathering and dissention prevention. Zykov knew that it was indispensable, and the sheer size of both the Galereya's agents and the territory they now had to cover essentially warranted by necessity its reformation into an official, government-sanctioned agency: The Ministry of Truth. From the lowliest soldier to some of the highest ranking officials in Zykov's realm, suddenly, as informants, they found themselves under the scrutiny of a new set of handlers, professionally and deftly collecting information and dispensing rewards as needed.\n\nCorporal Gennady Bogomolov sat in a barren office, nervously smoking. The young soldier, having willingly joined the ROA not too long ago, had already begun a seemingly-meteoric rise through the ranks due to his loyalty and leadership qualities. But it was just that loyalty that had caused himself to wander into the office of Leonid Viktorov, the local Ministry of Truth political officer. Bogomolov watched Viktorov, the officer's back to him, as he searched his records for two specific names. It was clear Viktorov was no soldier - longer hair, a scruffy beard, and, while hardly noticeable to the untrained eye, a small pot belly that betrayed the luxury that he had known. However, the bureaucrat-turned-agent's reputation for making Zykov's problems go away had preceded him. There were even rumors flying around the NCOs that if Viktorov arrived at your barracks, it was because he was planning to clean house. But Viktorov had been with Bogomolov's garrison for over a week and no arrests nor executions had come.\n\n\"You did the right thing, coming to me about this.\" Viktorov said, still leaning over his files, before eventually picking a pair of them up and sliding them across the table. \"It's these two you were speaking of, correct?\" Personnel files on two separate soldiers who had been on the pay of Oktan were shown to Bogomolov.\n\nThe corporal took a long drag from his cigarette. \"Yes, these two. What'll happen to them?\" Viktorov smiled an empty smile.\n\n\"That's for me to worry about. You're dismissed. And ah, before you go.\" the officer continued, pulling out a pack of Bogomolov's favourite obscure cigarettes and passing them to him. \"Remember to choose your friends carefully.\" As Bogomolov walked back to the barracks, he couldn't help but ponder if Viktorov was trying to buy him or threaten him."

Others had merely been compartmentalized in the foreign intelligence office, where they would hopefully stay away from domestic affairs.\n\nKeeping a strict enough net of surveillance on the population without sinking endless amounts of resources into the security apparatus was a tightrope to walk.

 SAM.73.desc: "Nikolay Valvov had a thousand things on his mind - none of them were the fact that the local chapter of the ROA was now setting up mandatory conscription requirements. Valvov was one of the proud and few smugglers to survive long enough in Russia to have his name known by the now - Grand Marshal, Mikhail Oktan. A combination of brutality, shrewd business dealings, and pure luck had propelled Valvov into the position of something resembling a middleman in the western Urals. Regardless, he had been recruited by Oktan some years back - the man paid well in both money and influence. \"God only knows how many times the man's bailed me out of tricky situations...\" the smuggler muttered to himself as he walked into a nondescript apartment building.\n\nReviewing the evidence that he had in mind and in document, he walked into the local branch of what Oktan called his \"Ministry of Truth\". All very official, the \"ministry\", which was as cloak and dagger as Valvov remembered from Oktan, contained only a few employees. After a cursory search for weapons and an explanation of who he was, Valvov sat down and explained what he had seen: He had to pay his way through a local checkpoint after a pair of particularly loud-mouthed ROA soldiers had blocked his way. Irritated by the fee, he noticed that the two of them had been complaining about how \"arbitrary\" some of Oktan's policies were.\n\nValvov, ever the diligent friend of the Grand Marshal, had done some digging, greased the palms of those who needed to be greased, and he had uncovered a ring of dissenters among some of the newer ROA officers - the ones that had been hurriedly promoted and pressed into service in and around the city of Syktyvkar - who had been planning some sort of mutiny against the more loyal members of Oktan's crew. The local minister, who had never introduced himself, nodded his head knowingly as Valvov disclosed what he had discovered, even going so far as judiciously examining the evidence that the smuggler had compiled for him. After nodding approvingly, the officer opened a drawer and threw a wad of cash on the table. \"Thanks for this, we'll take care of it going forward. You're free to go, Mr. Valvov,\" the man gruffly spoke, \"But I'll be keeping these files.

He wasn't quite sure what it meant, but what the young boy did know was that the terrible droning of airplanes in the sky and bombs falling were only distant, terrible childhood memories. His family had lived in a relatively large town, and as it was taken by the ROA, it seemed that their rule would be more of the same. Martial law, restrictions on gatherings and what people could do. But as their victory became more assured, it seemed as if their grip on the town slipped. It was a deceptive slipping, of course - as peace returned to Western Russia, Zykov's armed forces helped transition their new state from military to civilian rule. Village and town councils were introduced, and state-run schools with state-issued curricula were opened. Attendance was made mandatory for all children.\n\n\"The October Revolution - what do we know about it?\" asked the school teacher, whose name Viktor could barely remember. In fact, he couldn't remember when last he had been up this early. Early morning lessons were tough, and made worse by the fact that both his parents, who needed to work long days, would drop him off to the new school early so that they would be able to make it to their jobs on time.\n\nAnother child, one likely more diligent than Viktor answered. \"That it overthrew the Tsar?\" he asked. \"That's not exactly correct, but close. The Tsar was removed before the revolution.\" It was clear that she was looking for a specific answer. One, much to her chagrin, that wouldn't be granted. After a period of silence, the teacher, with some marked disappointment on her face, imparted the knowledge that she had wanted to hear upon the apparently-hapless schoolchildren.\n\n\"The Bolsheviks, using dangerous means and a lot of force, overthrew the republic and instituted a reign of terror.\" She stated. \"They killed many people, on purpose and by accident, with their policies.\" It was certainly true, but Zykov's mandated curricula was about to come into full effect with what the schoolteacher would say next. \"But our current chairman is working to reverse what they've done. He wants all of us to have a place to live in that is free, and safe from the dangers of communism.\" She finished, pausing to let that sink in before she went on. \"Now, let's look at...\""

The brave men of the ROA, drafted by the foreign tyrants, had helped fatally weaken the Western Soviet remnants before liberating all of Western Russia.\n\nOf the future, the teacher spoke only in generalities. The students needed to work hard to keep the Motherland strong and safe. One day, the decaying German's turn would come; just as the Tatars had been driven out of Russia in the end.\n\nThe bell of recess let the kids stream out onto a nearby field, where games of ROA and soviets were played out over and over.

That being said, the kids didn't have to actually like going to school. It's true, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for most of them, and would prepare them for the new Russia that Oktan had envisioned. However, truthfully, conditions were terrible, and the curriculum was more than controversial, even for the deplorable state of the Russian educational system.\n\nThe hours in class were almost as long as the hours in a factory, and discipline was harsh. Obedience was taught above all - the teachers were all uniformed and ranked the children based on their performance, engagement, and obedience. What they actually learned was incredibly basic - reading, writing, math... history was the worst. Even the youngest, poorest educated kids knew how trumped-up most of it was. But they dared not speak of it; any mere whisper of dissent could mean a serious beating.\n\nUltimately, the goal of the schools that Oktan and his friends had sponsored was not to educate the populace, but ready them for a greater purpose. Children will be educated in the most minimal and efficient way before they are sent off to either join the army, an officer's college, or a technical school, where they will be put to use by the state for Oktan's image. It wasn't a glorious education, nor was it particularly useful for any of the children, but it gave them the basic tools to survive and thrive in Russia's future."

The reality of the situation was that, even if the chairman ruled with a velvet glove, he had seized Russia through the use of an iron fist - a massive one: The ROA. Resistance to his rule was dealt with calmly if possible, but if Zykov's words couldn't pacify his enemies, well, the guns of his loyalists could. Despite the sweeping political and economic reforms that had been instituted, and despite the fact that military rule - martial law - had been lifted from almost all places within the control of the Provisional Commissariat, the streets in the towns and the cities were usually empty and solemn, save for the occasional person hurrying to work, or a patrol of ROA soldiers. In truth, the Russia that Zykov had begun to shape was one of relative freedom - elections, a liberalized economy, apart from the arms manufacturing sector, and a relatively fair judiciary. The reality of his vision paired with the legacy of the forces that he has to work with means that at least for now, the long shadow cast by the armed forces across Western Russia is here to stay.\n\nBut even then, all of that considered, Russia under the Provisional Commissariat is significantly better than it was during the terror bombings and the interlude before its unification. There was peace, and there was bread. There were jobs, and there were measures against bandits. While the peace was secured through arms, and those arms were very present in seemingly all throughout the commissariat, peace reigns. For now.

Even the presence of trusted men such as the village's priest did not inspire much confidence.\n\nEventually a first test of the new legal structure presented itself. A young man had allegedly been found rummaging through a neighbor's pantry, and had taken a bullet in the back for his trouble. The youth had survived, and his family were now accusing their neighbors of attempted murder. The accused had asked the tribunal's help, as few believed his side of the story. Better risk the military's justice than wait out a lynching.\n\nThe military officer acting as judge did a commendable job of patiently taking on both sides of the story. The jury of four soldiers and five civilians then adjusted for deliberations. A non-guilty verdict for the accused was reached. The judge then imposed on the man a few weeks of community service, as well as a fine meant to pay for the care of the injured youth.\n\nAll across Samara, a range of issues began having their day in court. From criminal cases to perfectly mundane administrative topics, agreements and rulings were handed out. Grudgingly, the civilians came to trust the military's willingness to collaborate with them for the sake of law and order."

 SAM.301.t: "The Democratic Successor"
 SAM.301.desc: "Miletiy Alexandrovich Zykov. The name bounced around the aide's head. Vlasov had been long silent about a potential political successor for him in the case of his death or incapacitation. However, it was obvious to everyone who was anyone in the ROA that the chairman wasn't getting any younger. But Zykov? Certainly an unorthodox choice. Vlasov had convened an emergency meeting of all of his aides nearly half an hour ago to make a preliminary announcement to them. But the announcement had turned into a discussion - the move was shocking to a number of the more conservative aides, who thought that the transition to Zykov would be a disaster.\n\nTruthfully, Vlasov was an alright boss. An aide never had to fear reprisals for small mistakes, like they did under many other senior officers. All were free to express their opinions there, so long as they were respectful. Luchenko, one of the aide's peers, voiced his. \"Zykov's gone as far as proposing the reinstitution of democracy, but the people know nothing of democracy. Most don't care. Will they even understand what that would mean? I worry that all we have worked to build will devolve into the chaos that we've heard is going on in Syktyvkar.\" The field marshal retorted in a tired but firm tone. \"Zykov may want democracy, Luchenko, but have we not been working towards a free Russia? What Russia is free but does not allow the people freedom?\"\n\nThere was silence for a bit. Another aide, one of Luchenko's good friends, finally spoke up. \"But, and if I may, there are some doubts that some of the staff have about Zykov's true intentions. Even if he were to... assume power... after you...\" The aide seemed to stumble. \"Some worry that he doesn't even believe in democracy, and will attempt to use it as a personal power tool.\" Vlasov grimaced briefly. It was clear that it had been a thought that had crossed his mind. \"His true intentions may be ambiguous. That may be true, but it never leaves this room. Even if he was not to restore democracy, I believe in his ability to restore hope. And right now? That's what we need most. We need to give the Russian people hope.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Vlasov was far from a talented orator, but all were aware of the poor opinion of their organization with most of the subjects they ruled - Zykov had always been a propagandist. \"Dismissed.\" Vlasov barked."

 SAM.302.t: "Vlasov's Heir"
 SAM.302.desc: "Andrey Sidorov, long-time aide to the long-suffering Vlasov, was called into his office alongside approximately a dozen other of his peers, from aides to administrative assistants, all of those who were relevant to Vlasov's immediate life. A few chairs had been scattered around, but most had to stand. Vlasov himself was behind his oaken desk, the entire barren room brightly framed by the large window immediately behind him. The old chairman took a cursory glance outside before turning towards Sidorov and the rest of the crowd. \"It's no secret that there's been some consternation about the matter of our movement's leadership after I am gone.\" It was a plain statement, and one that was definitely true. Aides like Sidorov would spend whole meals discussing the matter as if they were adolescents discussing romantic interests. \"I have taken a significant amount of time to think about the matter, and I have decided that I will be nominating Sergey Bunyachenko as the next in line for Chairman of our committee.\" Most of the aides nodded. After all, Bunyachenko was a sensible choice. He was popular with most of the officers and generally avoided shady dealings that some of his peers gleefully engaged in. One of the aides, however, a \"friend\" of Mikhail Oktan's, piped up. \"But why Bunyachenko? I don't get it\". A pensive look flashed over Vlasov's face for a minute, before he responded. \"Good question\", he started, looking directly into the aide's eyes, knowingly. \"The ROA is filled with rot - corruption, bribery, nepotism, anything that you can name. I'm no fool, I know it exists. Bunyachenko is a strong, honest man and an honorable general. I know that he will be both a good compromise candidate between our ideologically passionate peers and those who are less so. And I also know that he will work to expose and purge the rot from our organization, forcefully if need be. For if we are to rule all Russia, we need a man and an organization that is free from corruption and interested enough in crushing our enemies to not put his own interests above our ultimate goals. And ultimately...\" Vlasov's voice broke before he continued. \"I believe he is the only person who can succeed where I have been unable to.\" The question was not followed up with another - Vlasov solemnly dismissed the aides and instructed them to inform those necessary."

It did not matter to Semyon, so long as they didn't try anything funny.\n\n\"Hey! Semyon! Semyon, over here!\" Semyon turned to face the source of the voice, and an eyebrow rose in annoyed surprise at the familiar face running towards him. \"Ah, General Bunyachenko ordered that no soldier patrol alone for the time being. One of our own got badly beaten by dissidents. I volunteered to join you, seeing as we're old friends.\" Fyodor explained, having no way of knowing their friendship was not mutual. As they began to walk together despite Semyon's reluctance, Fyodor's latest topic of conversation caught Semyon's interest for once. \"...By the way, Semyon, I've been thinking about this for a while, but don't you think it's weird? Bunyachenko's a Ukrainian, yet he's prominent over here instead.\"\n\nFrowning, Semyon scratched his chin in confusion. \"What's so odd about a Ukrainian in Russia?\"\n\n\"It's not just him.\" Fyodor quickly assured him. \"Old man Kromiadi's a Greek, from down in the Caucasus, and Bayerski is a genuine Pole.\" Fyodor's voice began to grow hushed. \"Nobody really knows anything about Oktan, either, and there are all kinds of rumors swirling about. The most common seem to be that he's a Croat, or a Serb, something like that, and the son of a Balkan baron. And then there's Zykov, who admits he's a Ukranian, and nothing else. I've heard a few rumors that he's a Jew, but-\" before he could get anything else out, Fyodor found his mouth covered by Semyon's hand. It'd be a lie to say that he liked the annoying gossip at all, but just hearing something like that could place people in danger.\n\n\"Fyodor, perhaps it'd be wisest if we moved on to another topic of conversation.\" With a withering glare from Semyon, the rest of the patrol was conducted in silence."

 SAM.305.t: "The Monthly Shipment"
 SAM.305.desc: "One of the oddest phenomena in the territory controlled by the ROA was a small train station about an hour's march from the city of Samara. Previously a small stop from West Russia to the city, the station's real name had long been replaced by another. The Contraband Station, as it was now known, was one of the last stops for German smugglers - RK Moskowien garrison members who were paid too little to justify the risks they took. These smugglers, who brought with them just about anything a Russian soldier could dream of, made lucrative deals with the local garrisons to sell them things from tobacco and tea to chocolate and small mementos. Any luxury products that managed to trickle their way down into German-occupied Russia were made available to the ROA soldiers. It was one of the largest benefits to signing on with the ROA - simply put. Their old 'contacts' with the Germans had allowed them to afford a few more luxuries than their ideological rivals.\n\nAs both German and Russian worked to offload the goods from the train, they chatted with one another in broken fragments of their respective tongues, each side having made clear efforts to learn the other's language. One of the Russians asked a German about his family;\n\n\"I don't know, honestly,\" he responded. \"They're back in Prussia. I've heard that there's not much in the way of work, but other than that, there's been no word.\" The German, wanting to be courteous, responded in kind. \"What about here? What's life like in Samara?\" The Russian chuckled a little bit.\n\n\"I wouldn't know. I haven't seen the city in weeks, this is my first time being remotely close to it. Border patrols, skirmishes with bandits. I'm sure you're familiar.\"\n\nContraband Station was an incredibly strange site for cultural intermingling. The Russian soldiers didn't like their German counterparts who supplied the contraband, and they were confident that the Germans felt the same about them. And yet, the Russians attempted to learn German, and the Germans tried their hand at Russian. Everyone knew each other's names, food was shared, and jokes were made even if the language barrier impeded communication at times. Ultimately, both sides were a part of each other's lives, and both accepted that fact, even if they didn't like those that the fact was made up of."

 SAM.306.t: "The Iron Harvest"
 SAM.306.desc: "\"Harvest Days\" was what they were called around these parts. ROA soldiers would descend upon the town in their full battle dress, and proceed to help the local farmers with their harvest, providing the valuable manpower that their fields needed especially since so many of their sons had been conscripted or killed. When the harvest days had first been put in place, there was little trust or goodwill between the soldiers and the villagers, especially considering one of the reasons the soldiers helped out with the harvests was to take some of the food back with them. But as the harvest days became more regular, and the village became more acclimatized to the presence of the ROA they began to see them not as German collaborators, but as protectors. The atmosphere changed, trust was built between civilian and soldier. Eventually, some members of the ROA even began volunteering for the harvest days - usually conscripts who had a background in agriculture - hoping to be assigned to one. With some of the friendliest villages even offering to feed the soldiers during the day, it was a relatively comfortable assignment compared to border patrols or anti-bandit operations.\n\nWhile the Committee for the Liberation of the Russian People was far from popular, they had been working hard to secure their regime, distance themselves from the Germans, and even improve their relations with those that they ruled over. These harvests were a key part of that, and contributed to the image that the ROA was there to help, not hurt; to a large extent, it seemed that it was working. No one liked taxes, especially when they were being extracted in the form of food, and oftentimes after the harvests many of the farmers would stare jealously at the ROA's trucks as they pulled away from their village, wishing they had been able to keep more of the food they had grown. However, on the whole, it was a positive experience. The soldiers had even been effective in getting a few of the local boys and restless farmhands to sign up with the ROA, which further helped dissipate tensions with the locals. Most of the core of the ROA had no local ties to the area around Samara, and having patrols protect those that they knew was a huge boon for the KONR's propaganda machine."

In the off season where the constant small-time raids and warfare of the Russian Anarchy simmered down, men could be seen discussing with fellow soldiers from across the border.\n\nSo it came that a few riflemen of the Russian Liberation Army came to drink in a small village of a contested area. When men of the Imperial Army entered, there was a momentary tension. That too died down as the Vlasovites offered a round of drinks to the Imperials.\n\nTalks ebbed and flowed on a range of topic. A particularly violent group of bandits that both groups of soldiers had fought with (the bastards). The recent weather (mostly bad). The news from beyond the Urals (very confused). Eventually the topic moved to the WRRF. A few of the veterans of both groups had fought in the fifties. After comisserating on the shame of fighting fellow Russians to defeat the reds, the soldiers shared war stories back and forth. A few more rounds were shared. This casual conversation marked the high point of the evening's mood. Eventually a bitter dispute erupted as to the legitimacy of the ROA. Had it not begun as a German militia, dogs for the invaders? The ROA veteran snapped back that the tsar had been invited by the Germans, and that the white soldiers should not talk about serving tyrants, foreign or domestic.\n\nThe barman did not speak. Business was good for now. When these idiots started fighting again, the bar might have to move once more. Such was life in the Russian Anarchy."

 SAM.308.t: "Strikes in Samara"
 SAM.308.desc: "Twelve o'clock. That was the deadline for the strike to disperse. The commander of the local garrison, Major Popov, noted that the time was 12:32, well past the time that the strike should have dispersed. He radioed his troops who were observing the situation over at the factories - ROA troops frequently mediated between employers and employees, especially during tense situations like this one. He asked a simple question - \"Have they dispersed?\" The answer Popov got was not the one that he was hoping for. \"The strikers won't give up\", the voice on the other end of the radio responded. \"Worse still, there's some rumors among the workers still here and their managers that the strike was actually orchestrated by communist agents, 'plants', as they call them. Things are getting pretty tense, people are throwing things\". What came after that was what really worried Major Popov. \"Some of the greener troops... I think they're unnerved. If things go south, they might start shooting.\"\n\nPopov cursed to himself. The damned strikers. It was the third time in three months that this had happened, and each time, it was up to the ROA to sort things out. How many times would he have to deal with this before he made his superiors understand that he, and those he commanded, were soldiers, not policemen? Regardless, Popov had to make a choice - he could send in his troops to disperse the strikers, and potentially kill or weed out the apparent communist plants. Surely, this would calm things down and set a precedent to the ungrateful strikers that their insubordination would not be tolerated. It might make us unpopular in the short run but it would also ensure the stability in our streets, for workers will surely be reluctant to complain if it meant being on the wrong end of the barrel of a gun. However, Popov would have the lives of those workers on his hands. Similarly, if he refused to send in the army, the workers would be happy, and alive of course, but business interests would feel betrayed. It wasn't an easy call by any means, but Popov knew that he would have to make it - it would be a PR disaster if his recruits lost their cool and fired into the crowds."

 SAM.309.desc: "The Russian Liberation Army was nothing if not pervasive in their efforts to patrol the territory that they controlled - and that they did. Daily patrols went out, came back in, checkpoints along the roads and troops stationed throughout the hinterland of their territory ensured that the Officers, and ultimately Vlasov himself, knew what was going on. As a result, it didn't take long for news of an envoy from the east to arrive at a local garrison station. The ROA was consistently weary about outsiders and strangers, to the point where a diplomat from beyond the Urals instantly kicked up suspicion. Maksim Oliynyk, the officer in charge of the garrison station that the envoy had been escorted to didn't particularly want to meet the man - in fact, he was suspicious that the man was who he claimed he was.\n\nSitting down with the envoy, it was clear that he was frustrated. Protesting his being whisked away to the garrison, rather than Samara itself. Oliynyk sat down with the man, looking at him up and down. \"Who are you?\" he asked, \"And why have my caravan and I been stolen away here? I am bound for Samara.\"\n\nThe commander took a pause before he responded. \"For all that matters to you, I am Samara. Now, tell me, who are you?\"\n\nSome further protests were given, but the envoy soon realized that he wasn't getting anywhere. He relinquished, and eventually introduced himself as a diplomat hailing from Novosibirsk, beyond the Urals. The meeting became closer to an interrogation, with Oliynyk learning about the events that were going on in the east. The envoy, after the questioning was over, attempted to offer to trade with the ROA. Oliynyk's polite, but cold \"no, thank you\" dissuaded him, and he left back to Novosibirsk soon after."

 SAM.310.desc: "Armaments Factory no.14 was a small complex near the Samara railyards. \"Repurposed\" by the ROA itself during the darkest days of the terror bombing, the small shack was soon built up. The \"factory\" - in reality little more than a large building with a few long, wooden tables and a number of machine tools - was dedicated to taking apart German small arms and reverse engineering them for our own purposes. Vlasov and most of those under him knew well that their German support would eventually run out, and they had long made provisions to ensure that their myriad of German equipment, from Kar98Ks to StG-44s would remain operable even once it was no longer possible to receive their parts from their former benefactors neither officially nor through smugglers.\n\nThe factory rarely worked during the day - the bombings made it hard to - but workers toiled all night, with small headlamps and minimal light, disassembling old or well-worn rifles and their respective ammunitions. These workers, despite their rugged condition, were not civilians. Not officially, at least. They were engineers, not just employees of the ROA, but members of it and experienced in handling German weapons for many years. Until recently, the factory had been minimally staffed.\n\nHowever, with the increasing amount of bloody victories won by the ROA, the soldiers at the frontline needed more and more weapons, and the number of those that we can get from German smugglers is becoming miniscule compared to our needs. As such, Armaments Factory no.14 has, as of recently, expanded not only in terms of manpower, but location as well. A number of shoddily-constructed buildings have been added to the original to form a sort of complex, where dedicated stations and senior engineers act as efficiency-generating machines. As of late the factory was no longer just reverse-engineering weapons, but producing their own versions of them. Certainly not with the workmanship of the originals, they were cheap and easy to produce, and that's what the high command wanted."

He had intentionally ordered the removal of most luxuries from his office and his living quarters two years prior, in a vain attempt to stave off his ever-present guilt. The old marshal stood, looking out the window, a drink in hand. He couldn't remember the time, all he knew was that it was dark out. Midnight, maybe? 1? 2? Who cared. The night was the only time that Vlasov could be alone.\n\nEvery waking hour of the day he had aides, officers, and administrators asking him the most mundane of questions, but lately he had become disinterested in answering them, instead preoccupying himself with a reflection on his life's work. What was it, if not the Committee? And what had they accomplished? At what cost? These were the questions that resounded in Vlasov's head day and night.\n\n\"And for the life of me, I can't figure out the answers.\" he mumbled to himself. He couldn't even remember if his alliance with the Nazis was one of pragmatic survival or the desire to see a Russia forged in his image. He barely had an image anymore. He continued to pace around his room, occasionally glancing up to the stoic portrait of himself that his aides insisted he keep in his office. A single word came to his mind: legacy. What was to be his legacy? Vlasov had always thought about writing a book. After all, who else would tell his story the way that it should be told? \"The Germans remember me as a traitor, the Russians remember me as worse. Those in the West barely even know who I am.\" He stated to no one in particular. Realistically, no book would be coming. Vlasov knew he couldn't.\n\nAfter pacing some more, he sat, slumped in his desk chair, looking at his drink. It had become harder to resist the urges to refill the glass over and over with the premium vodka he had \"liberated\" for himself. He looked to his glass - it was now empty. When did he drink it? He couldn't remember. Glancing towards his desk, there were two items that came to his attention - the bottle and his service pistol. A brief idea crossed his mind, but common sense got the better of him. He decided to retire for the night, after a long, deep sigh."

However, instead of the panic that they had hoped to inspire in the Chairman, they saw only resolve.\n\n\"Men, arrest these fools and you shall be pardoned for your part in their little game,\" he ordered. The regular soldiers that had barged into the office looked at each other, unsure. \"This is your last chance, men, don't do anything you'll regret.\" Finally, they reacted.

Please, take a seat.\" Before he could so much as twitch, he had been disarmed by his own bodyguards, the traitors, and tied to his desk chair.\n\nThe conspirator made to speak again, but before he could yet another group burst into his office, this time through the front door. Once again, a squad of ROA regulars was being led into his office, but this time it was one of Oktan's lackeys at their head. Before they even attempted to make demands the civilians fled and a fight began in the close confines of the office.\n\nWith the commotion as a distraction, Bunyachenko was able to loosen the bonds around him and escape through the open door. As he descended through the chaos left in the wake of Oktan's men, he rallied some loyal officers and troops. With their help, the conspirators were rounded up or killed, and calm descended once again on Samara.

Remember, struggle not against your family, but against those who threaten it!\"\n\nToday, Zykov took to the air to announce the end of the mutinies and to encourage those still in arms to give up, offering amnesty to all those who were not involved in instigating the mutiny. The path to end the mutiny and prevent an all-out explosion of the ROA into civil war was engineered masterfully by the veteran propagandist, who seemed to exhibit perfectly the tenets that Macchiavelli wrote about centuries ago. Zykov had bribed those who could be bought, talked down those who could be talked, and threatened violence upon those who would do neither. The combination worked, if just barely. Armed confrontation was reserved to a few hardcore mutineers, who utterly refused surrender. All of these facts, and the immense amount of relief given by them, was swirling around the heads of the committee, which Zykov stood in front of. The enigmatic orator had already given a cursory briefing to the committee about the situation, and the fallout. However, his coup-de-grace was yet to come. \"As I'm sure all of you are aware, it was the perfidious Mikhail Oktan, who organized this mutiny against the authority of our dear chairman.\" Actually, for most, that was a surprise. \"Indeed, it's clear, at least to me, that we can no longer tolerate such a rat-like insubordinate in our ranks, no matter how entrenched he may be.\" Zykov looked around this room, his cool, calculating gaze analyzing each committee member. He was confident in their vote. One by one, each consented to Oktan's arrest. \"Very well. If it is the will of the committee, I will order the arrest of Mikhail Oktan and his subsequent trial.\"\n\nOktan would not get a trial. After his arrest, during which he made no small protest, he was taken to a small barn near the outskirts of Samara, and given a sentencing, ultimately being shot. His body was burned. Such was the end of Mikhail Oktan."

The former journalist did not walk into the office so much as he tumbled in, pushed around by the weight of events.\n\n\"Zykov. Good to see you.\" The democratic activist began to speak, only for the chairman to cut him off. \"No, please let me continue. Right now, a tidal wave of shit is threatening to wash away our progress. The Officer Committee believes that Oktan is behind everything that's happening right now in the army and the liberated territories. You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces.\"\n\n\"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the Officer Committee? I should go see them directly\"\n\nBunyachenko smiled a little. Something of Zykov's old bravado remained. That was good. \"The Officer Committee are useless, tired old men. On that, you, Oktan and I agree. No, Zykov, you will argue your case with me. You are an eloquent fellow. If you convince me that you can be of use, perhaps you'll see some of your dreams realized. I'm in the market for new... associates.\"\n\nZykov's eyes shone a little brighter. Or had it been just an illusion?

This treacherous attempt to destroy the last hope of all Russians came to a head just days ago when units loyal to Sergey Bunyachenko attempted to storm the central districts of our state, supported by tanks, saboteurs, and artillery.\n\nHowever, just before these extremists and blackguards reached the residence of our great leader Zykov, the stalwart loyalists among the Russian Liberation Army mobilized to prevent the overthrow, and save our movement from destruction. Overwhelmed by the stern defence of these brave soldiers and surrounded on all sides by a jeering populace, the putschists soon felt the jaws of the state closing in around their pathetic rebellion, and fled to the outlying districts, where they soon turned to brigandry to survive. Commander Bunyachenko has called for peace and reconciliation, claiming that the putschists had nothing to do with him or the Officer Committee. While the disloyal general is likely to be kept on the general staff, his political career is widely seen as irreparably damaged.

 SAM_bunyachenko.1.t: "Out on the Field of Gold"
 SAM_bunyachenko.1.desc: "The President had had enough of paperwork for the day. His guard, as always, refused him the luxury of wandering the streets of the capital. Far better for his evening walks to be in the presidential palace's gardens. Gardens were a bit too grandiose a word, Bunyachenko thought, for the half finished assembly of shrubs and plants.\n\nWalking loops around the closed garden, the President's thoughts were free to wander beyond the confine of the park. Politics was a new career for him. A soldier's life had been his, after joining the red army as a teenager. Hard fighting in the plains of Ukraine, against the Whites and the Ukrainian National Republic. Bunyachenko had been free, then. He and his comrades, fighting for a new Russian nation, freed from archaic tsarism, fighting with the naivety of youth for a better future. After the civil war he had been deployed to Central Asia, fighting Basmachi rebels. Different plains, but the same endless blue sky. The President smiled bitterly. Freedom, as always, was wasted on the young.\n\nThe Reds had turned out no better than the Tsar. Endless court politics, as Bukharin's boyars ran roughshod over the country. Ukraine had not been spared their incompetence. Fields of gold, exploited by faceless bureaucrats. Neither had Bunyachenko. Yet he had kept fighting. Accused by the paranoid men in Moscow of failing to win a war their incompetence had caused to be doomed from the start. He had fought on then, naively, too. Being captured by the Germans had merely confirmed the Reds' paranoid accusations that he was a traitor.\n\nHe hated the Germans for destroying Russia. Truth be told, however, they had merely ended what the Bukharinists had begun. It felt good to know that the WRRF was dead and buried. Now all the President had to do was to destroy the Germans, kick over their own rotting structure. Perhaps then he would truly be free, innocent in the court of public opinion. Until then he had to keep following orders. Stuck in the presidential palace, Sergey Bunyachenko continued his evening walk round and round his prison's courtyard."

Perhaps they expected a shelled-out runway and some surplus automobiles, flanked by vintage motorcycles in a discount motorcade.\n\nThey were received on fresh tarmac by Bunyachenko, flanked by the heads of Vyatka Metallurgical, IzhZla Concern, and VTB, wearing crisp suits cut from the finest Russian wool. A small band played the Japanese national anthem as Bunyachenko confidently shook the hands of the Japanese delegates before escorting them to a line of gleaming automobiles, surrounded by an honor guard.\n\nPerhaps they expected a ramshackle hovel, the cramped presidential palace of yet another Russian warlord with delusions of grandeur. And, had they wandered beyond the main streets, they might have been correct. But Bunyachenko left nothing to chance: the Japanese sun flag hung from freshly-installed lampposts, while the Japanese emissaries silently watched the meticulously cleaned and spotless cityscape roll past.\n\nThe Japanese were a people of order, of punctuality, of proper appearances. And they were arrogant - an opportunity Bunyachenko would not squander.\n\nMuch later, as Bunyachenko bade the Japanese good night after a sumptuous, extravagant banquet, the Mitsubishi representative laughed drunkenly to his colleagues, forgetting the presence of Bunyachenko's translator: \"If only half the Sphere were as agreeable as these Russians!\" At that moment, he knew that he had them."

 SAM_bunyachenko.4.desc: "Again, he had gotten home too late to tuck his children into bed. The apartment was spacious, better than the refugee camp they had once dwelled in. Courtesy of the new republic. President Bunyachenko claimed to have nothing but respect for hard working Russians. Housing was a right for hardworking Russians, the former military man declared over and over in his speeches. As was education. The father saw his children's school books on the table, neatly stacked at the end of the day. Homeworks had been dutifully completed. Dmitry's penmanship was not great for a ten years old. But he had learned to read so fast. If only their mother could have seen all this. The small ones worked so hard.\n\nAt this hour of the day, his only companion was the bottle. A little drink, to soothe the day's pains. He had to take long hours, to keep his children fed, to keep qualifying for free apartments near the train station. The pay was good. What were a few aches at the end of the day? All of Russia was being rebuilt. All of Russia...\n\nThe man caught himself pouring a third glass. He put the bottle back in the keyboards, locked it with a key. It would not do for the little ones to try their father's medicine. The third glass went down easy, quenching his thirst for warmth.\n\nEveryone was working so hard. President Bunyachenko's economic miracle would leave his children a better nation. The father knew, hoped, that the President shared the workers' hard schedule. Many dismissed Bunyachenko as a traitor. The father knew better. All had done terrible things in the Rusisan Anarchy to survive. The father... No, better not follow that line of thought.\n\nThe President claimed things would get better, work shifts would get easier as the industry advanced. The father hoped they would. The daily glass of vodka had turned into two glasses. Three, recently. Burdens had to be carried. Perhaps his generation would be the last lost Rusisan generation. Better try to get some sleep."

Usually it's from Brazil, or Nicaragua, but the importers can get beans from the Sphere these days for an extra fee. She doesn't feel the need, though. When she was a girl, even a weak cup of black tea from the far south was a luxury. Fazenda coffee will suffice. As she sips, she hears the front door creak open downstairs. That would be the maid, three minutes early. Clearly yesterday's tongue-lashing got the job done.\n\nThe company sedan pulls up a half hour later. From her home-one of the new townhouses on a tree-lined promenade-the car passes rotting apartments and tin sheds. Many of her employees live here. She used to, too, back when she was one of the first woman engineers at Ukhta's main refinery. She slept on the floor, and her daughter slept on their couch. Now, her daughter goes to school in Samara. Every week, Yulechka writes a letter home to her mother. The uniforms at that school make her look quite sharp.\n\nAt the refinery, she marches through halls and across worksites, accompanied by the sycophants that she calls her staff. They supervise the visbrakers and catalytic crackers and pipelines that send oil from Ukhta to... well, to everywhere. The black insignia of Rosneft is emblazoned on storage tanks across Western Russia, after all. The Queen, in turn, supervises them. It's a good job. Everyone strives for a good job these days, especially since so few can get them. It gnaws at her, some days. The guilt. The feeling that she has betrayed something, someone. So tomorrow, as per usual, one of her accountants will go to those rotting apartments and tin sheds, and press notes into the hands of the poor.\n\nPerhaps they will buy a cup of coffee."

Her limp legs daubed blood across the floor of the Vyatka steel mill.\n\nWhere was Aleksey? His diminutive stature masked the ferocity of his intelligence, as he had excoriated the Vyatka executive who had warned them that this was their last chance. She squinted at a mountain of bodies being piled near the furnace, and found his bullet-ridden corpse at the top.\n\nSo many dead, for Kolya. Her darling son, her only son, swallowed by that infernal furnace because the kombinats couldn't be assed to put up railings in their factories -\n\nA kick to her side.

My allies, they um, assured me that they would transport new farming equipment to Korol as soon as I get elected!\" The crowd returned light applause.

The new chairman's grin widened as he yanked the first drawer open and saw the treasures within: a shiny Luger, a gift from some bribed German officer; an assortment of Soviet medals, stashed away in shame; ah, and some Vyatka vodka! Oktan took a swig, savoring the smoothness, then noticed the finest prize of all.\n\nA fat, crisp wad of Reichsmarks, several thousand at least. The last of his pay packets from the West Russian War, presumably. Oktan flicked through the notes, then raised them to his nose and inhaled deeply. There was nothing better than the clean, promising smell of German-minted currency on a sad day such as this.\n\nOktan quickly set about stuffing as much as he could carry into the pockets of his overcoat - and then paused. In all the excitement, he'd quite forgotten what Vlasov's passing meant. Chairman... Chairman Oktan. It had a nice ring to it. It was the ring of gold against silver, of fine crystal glasses being set before him and filled with Breton wine. Smiling again, he resumed his inveterate looting.

Amid this electoral jungle, a man of vision has emerged. Nikolay Rumyantsev, a colorful character with a colorful past, having fought for both Free France and the Tsar, has declared in his newly minted paper, the creation of his own party.\n\nThe Russian Movement of Democratric Reform is a coalition of various liberal and democratic factions that are committed to the continued republicalizing of Russia. This center-left organization, having managed to squirm its way out from under Zykov's suppression of the Left, has laid itself plainly into the public eye. Rumyantsev has presented a platform that has proven appealing to the people of the republic, promising to work to ban voter suppression and extend the vote to émigrés. Zykvov has considered the situation carefully. Rumyantsev was a transplant from Vyakta, though he had since sworn off Tsarism. The journalist knew all coalitions were delicate things, especially considering the one he had been a part of in the early days when Russia was merely Samara.

But not him.\n\nBecause, Samutin knew, as much as Oktan or his henchmen might have wanted to add his name to a list, they still, if they wanted territory to continue to loot, had to run a country. That took professionals. Administrators. Men who would tell the truth when decisions arose, even if that truth was unpalatable. Men like him.\n\nThat did not, as Samutin had been made painfully aware of, mean that he was safe. Far from it. He was expected to work. Expected to perform. Expected to obey. Expected to be on his best behaviour. He very much intended to be - he had been given a second chance, and he knew that a third would not be given, no matter how dire the nation's need might be. If his first task was anything to go by, that need would, in fact, soon be so dire.\n\nHe was to complete an inventory and report on the state of hundreds of industrial sites in Western Russia. Sites that the ROA had 'secured' during its regional campaigns. Sites that Oktan and his men had likely looted of everything of value. Sites that would have to be rebuilt, at the people's expense, if Russia was to continue standing.\n\nWith a sigh, he began arranging for transport. His personal feelings no longer mattered. What mattered was that he was alive, and he intended to remain so. It was time to work."

 SAM_oktan.8.t: "The Kleptocrat's Fascist"
 SAM_oktan.8.desc: "Vladimir Samarin had not expected to be working for a bandit king. Then again, he had not expected a bandit king to have effectively established control over all of Russia.\n\nStill, even as much as he despised Mikhail Oktan - or whatever his real name was - he had to give him credit. Samarin knew that the man would not have been able to advance as far as he had without possessing considerable, if warped, political intelligence. He also knew that Oktan's slavish dedication to personal profit offered opportunity to those under him that, like Samarin, were true ideologues.\n\nAnd so he, a lifelong believer in the strength and national advancement promised by fascist ideals, had agreed to join Russia's governing kleptocrat, receiving an appointment as Foreign Minister. He imagined that Oktan saw the whole situation as something of a twisted joke, using one such as he to promote the 'virtues' of his gangster state. Samarin knew that, regardless of what he was told, he was being watched, and so he would act his part, and do his job.\n\nStill, even though Samarin knew his position as one of expediency, it did not mean that he did not burn with anger and hatred every time he watched Oktan or one of his cronies siphon more resources away from Russia and towards themselves. And, so, he had decided to, within the bounds of his position, do something about it.\n\nHe could, and would, use his authority to establish a domestic, grassroots political organization. An organization dedicated to strength and national advancement, virtues that Oktan and his faction could not publicly disavow.\n\nOne day, he hoped, it might be strong enough to restore some semblance of true government to the country that he loved so much."
 SAM_oktan.8.a: "At least he's unlikely to steal."
 SAM_oktan.9.t: "The Golden Throne"
 SAM_oktan.9.desc: "Oktan held a photograph in his hands. It was bleached with age, the shot unfocussed and grainy, but he knew what it depicted. In the photo, a younger Oktan stood next to Vlasov, Zykov, and Bunyachenko, brothers united together in the cause of a free Russia. He looked at his fellow officers with contempt, muttering to himself, \"I won. I beat you. The scheming Jew and the old man, dust in the wind. They will remember me, they will build statues of me!\" Oktan shook his head, throwing the photo into the flames of his hearth, the gilded forms of Roman gods watching the Samara Four blacken and curl in the heat. Oktan uncorked a crystal decanter of fine plundered liquor, pouring himself a tumbler-full. He raised the bitter glass to his lips, savoring the harsh flavor as it burned down his throat. He could be whatever he liked, he mused. President? Tsar? Emperor? Vozhd? Whatever title Oktan pleased, he could adopt. The thought of \"Vozhd-Emperor\" crossed his mind, but he dismissed it as ridiculous.\n\nAll, he supposed, was not well. While his immediate threats had been dealt with, there were rumblings beneath his feet. The \"orthodox\" fascists in Samara hated him, and Kromiadi and Truhin threatened his rule with officer cliques and schemes. No matter, mused Oktan, today he was king of the Russians. Kings often ruled with a golden scepter in one hand and a butcher's cleaver in the other, why shouldn't Oktan? Today, he would relax and enjoy the fruits of his labor. Tomorrow, heads would roll."

 money.1.desc: "I have been requested by the Russian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Russian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the Siberian region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling USD 40,000,000. The Russian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Russian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.\n\nYou assistance is requested as a non-Russian citizen to assist the Russian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Russia, in moving these funds out of Russia. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Russian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Russian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or USD 4 million of this amount.\n\nHowever, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Russian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least USD 100,000 in a Russian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nIf it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Samara, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Russian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nPlease call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Russian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it."

 SAM_zykov.6.desc: "Zykov licked the tip of his middle finger before he turned the page on the telegram he had received early that morning. \"Silayev,\" the journalist muttered, as if tasting the word. The former politician from [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk] had seen fit to send him a six-page missive explaining his potential worth to the Zykovite faction. Zykov had only now just picked it up, several minutes before his meeting with the man. Better to get the measure of the man in the flesh rather than in paper.\n\nA knock came at Zykov's office door, and the wily propagandist bid the visitor enter. In came Ivan Silayev, his lined face further creased by a grin, his graying hair swept back.\n\n\"President Zykov, a pleasure to finally meet you,\" said the man, extending his hand to Zykov, who accepted it in his own. Zykov smiled back, bidding his visitor to take a seat.\n\n\"I understand you have a proposition for me?\" asked the President of the Russian Republic. Silayev launched into his speech, big talk regarding the integration of industry and big business into the government itself, a corporate oligarchy with the backing of the state. Zykov listened intently. It was an interesting proposal.\n\n\"Very well, Silayev, welcome to the Unity Party.\" Silayev's eyes glittered like tiny gems in the lamplight at Zykov's words. \"Trial by fire,\" said Zykov next, and a startled Silayev blinked. Zykov grinned, \"Prove your worth to the party. I'm putting you in the committee responsible for integrating Western Siberia into the republic. If you do well and pull your weight, I'm sure you'll go far in the party.\""

 SAM_zykov.7.desc: "Vasily Arkhipov felt silly standing in line at the voting booth. Here he was, a sailor nobody with delusions of grandeur. Vasily wiped sweat from his brow and from his tired eyes. The campaign for mayor of the city of Kurgan had been tremendously taxing for the shy officer, every speech and public rally a mountain of anxiety. He had overcome them all, true, but this seemed like the greatest peak of all, the Everest of his campaign. Such thoughts were ridiculous, really, all he had to do was pass the post and submit his ballot. This was how things were done in a democracy, but to vote for himself seemed the height of arrogance.\n\n\"Mr. Arkhipov,\" repeated the kindly old man standing outside of the booth, \"you may enter when you are ready, but do hurry, the line is backing up.\" The old man, who had likely seen tyrannies unending, seemed delighted to be exercising his democratic rights and gave Arkhipov a reassuring smile. \"First time voting?\" asked the man, and the marine flashed a nervous smile and swallowed harshly.\n\n\"Yes, it is. Sorry, I'll stop holding up the line.\" Arkhipov entered the booth, holding the little piece of paper in his hands. With hands shaking slightly from excitement, he pencilled in the square next to \"Arkhipov, Vasily: Unity Party\"."

While there is some merit to this, with Sweden being able to perhaps guarantee its continued neutrality as a mediator, there are also potential consequences that must be considered.

 SAM.96.desc: "FIELD MARSHAL'S EYES ONLY\n\nTo Field Marshal Bunyachenko,\n\nABSTRACT: The Committee for the revitalization of controlled territories has found that while economically it can be of much use, the destruction and lack of economic planning has made the use of such resources unavailable to our use. Thus some elements of economic planning are proposed to 'jump start' the economy for the purposes of beginning the long awaited reunification of Russia.\n\nREPORT SUMMARY: It has been found that a significant amount of factories have been destroyed from either raids from opposing warlords, or due to German terror bombings. What few remain suffer from a lack of manpower. Similar outcomes occur in construction and extraction industries. In spite of this, the unemployment rate is high, especially in urban areas. This has caused suffering among families, who rely on charity to get by. For full analysis, see pages 20 through 54 of this report.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: To use government powers to enforce an end to unemployment, through a combination of government assistance, relocation of the unemployed towards areas and industries where needed most, and, when no other option is available, conscription into the armed forces. While this would expand government powers into the economy thus unseen, it would make it (a) more viable and attractive to do business and (b) increase productivity of the average citizen through additional wages. For full in-depth recommendation reports, see pages 56 through 121."

Economic and industrial resources are now towards peak economic performance due to the increase in both employment and rebuilding of previously destroyed equipment.\n\nREPORT SUMMARY: With the institution of minimal government planning, specifically of enforcing employment of citizens through incentives and punishments, economic output has increased many times over. Poverty has decreased, unemployment is nearly non-existent, and for the first time in years new factories are being created throughout the country. The unemployment program has even been so successful that juveniles (13-17 being the majority) makeup a significant portion of the workforce, although by no means a majority. While far from done, the program has made much progress in revitalizing the economy, which has benefited military production in domestic firearms, making unification a more likely outcome. See pages 18 through 30 for full report.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Aside from continuing the program, it is recommended that additional resources be made available to increase business opportunity. With additional economic incentives, the Committee believes that the economy would expand greatly, simultaneously decreasing poverty and also increasing our military objectives."

Unfortunately, he had ties with Oktan, though Vlasov doubted even that man held any love for Zakutnyy. Nobody did. They'd all defected, of course, but Zakutnyy had joined their side without hesitation. Eagerly, even, and without an ounce of his reason for it being ideological. He just thought himself too good for a POW camp. A true coward among an army of cowards.\n\n\"Yes, continue,\" Vlasov finally said. As Zakutnyy discussed his plans for the development of defenses against German bombings and increased armament production, Vlasov barely listened, knowing his approval or disapproval of the plan mattered little in the grand scheme of things.\n\nHowever, when Zakutnyy began speaking on how it was only natural that such a great plan was devised by a brilliant mind such as his own, Vlasov couldn't stop himself from slamming his fist down on the desk and standing up, shooting a seething glare towards Zakutnyy causing the man to take a couple steps back. \"You-\" Almost as quickly as he had given in to his irritation, Vlasov cooled down. Shouting at Zakutnyy wouldn't change anything except maybe for the worse. He had to keep his cool; it was the only thing of real value he still had left. \"... Sorry.

He cycled through memories to see if he had any good ones, but they were all of the same kind. Bribes, backroom deals, plain and simple robbery, assassinations, diverting valuable resources from the front lines into schemes and arms deals that benefited him alone. No matter. He'd simply invent a story.\n\n\"I was on the front lines in the fifties, when suddenly I was surrounded by communists...\" His story, completely fictitious, dragged on into the night, and she hung on every word, until they kissed after the conclusion.

As his vision swam, he spotted the aide standing in the doorway from the corner of his eye. The man squirmed in place. Oktan was considering sending him away, but on a whim he waved him in. \"What is it now?\"\n\nIt was somewhat more serious than he had expected. Two warlords with neighbouring territories - men he had made himself - were feuding. Already some skirmishes between their troops had resulted in deaths, and they seemed to be stockpiling arms to go to war. The dispute was, as far as he could make out, more about mutual loathing than anything else. Oktan sighed. The odd massacre across the border he could wave away. This was an internal matter, and required action. One of the warlords was a bonehead, but of the other he had expected more.\n\n\"This could have waited until after the party,\" said Oktan, watching the aide wither under his glare. He held the look for a moment, then smiled and clapped the man on the back. \"You're here now. And you're right, something has to be done.\" Oktan turned over an unlit cigarette in his left hand, skimming over the written report a second time. He'd already condemned the more foolish warlord to death. But the other, such wasted promise. A shame. \"Kill both of them,\" he told the aide finally. \"You can give this to Belyaev. Tell him to avoid killing their men if he can manage it, but that he can do so if needed. Wait!\" he called after the aide, as the man stood. \"After it's done, hang the bodies in public.\"\n\nOktan returned to the party with a grin, but his heart was no longer in it.

Both had been killed during their participation in the political militias in '62 and '63 respectively. Turgenev, like his parents, had grieved, but death was commonplace in Russia. But Turgenev had made his peace with the nature of the Republic's trade-off: one could live a free life and speak for what they believed in. In return, a certain degree of risk in one's everyday life could be expected.\n\nSo when the Russian Liberation Army paraded themselves through Syktyvkar in an apparent parody of the Soviet soldiers Turgenev's father would tell him about, he had been worried for the future of his livelihood and the status quo he had gotten used to. And for a time, his fears had been legitimized. The ROA, on orders of their officers, had looted the city. They had stripped it of what wealth it had but when they had finished, things returned to a certain normalcy. Turgenev went back to work in his factory; it was as if the looting had never happened. But the ROA promised peace and prosperity, and eventually they had delivered. The city saw a massive revitalization in terms of jobs and quality of living.\n\nTurgenev may have had a thicker wallet and better food, but he always felt that dark clouds were on the horizon, a belief reinforced by the continual military patrols and rumors of brutal \"policing actions\" in rural areas.

That is, until he saw the money Oktan was offering. It was enough to... well, overhaul the team and make way in the budget for better draft picks the following year. And that was just to start. Moore barely waited a day before he wired his answer: yes.\n\nThe game itself was quite civil. The Russian team was filled with large, intimidating figures who looked more like soldiers than they did athletes. But despite the final outcome, a 4-0 win for the Canadians, Moore had been impressed with the performance of the Russians. He joked to himself that in a few more years, the Russians could even rival Canadian hockey talent.\n\nAfter the game, Moore and his coaches spent the evening at Oktan's residence in Samara, a palace of decadence, with the finest cigars and expensive vodka.

 POLITICS_MILETIY_ZYKOV_DESC: "It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Miletiy Alexandrovich Zykov has been the heart and the conscience of the Russian Liberation Movement - if one can call such a scattered congregation of Vlasovite generals and civilian figures that was assembled under the auspices of the Nazi invaders a 'movement'. Recognized for his talent as a propagandist, Zykov was the person who shaped the ideology of the Russian Liberation Army and put forward the democratic ideals that proved to be so important in the struggle against the Soviet tyranny. Even if those ideals were obscured by the necessities of war, Zykov consistently espoused his support for renewed Russian democracy and provided much-needed legitimacy to the otherwise doomed cause of serving the occupants and the occupied alike.\n\nThe past and true motives of Zykov remain an unresolvable enigma even to his colleagues. His contradictory, often nonsensical comments about himself only further widen the web of rumors that has enveloped his background. Claiming to be a former adjutant of Nikolai Bukharin and supporter of the Marxist thought, Zykov prefers to imagine himself as an adherent of Russian republicanism who saw the inevitable failure of Bolshevism. Meanwhile, his numerous opponents within the KONR depict Zykov as a dishonest opportunist, a lowly Bolshevik Jewish writer who defected to the ROA only to save his skin and has since capitalized on a populist appeal and an idealistic facade to expand his personal influence.\n\nBeing one of the closest people to Andrey Vlasov and one of his most avid supporters, Zykov achieved the favor of the old General to pursue his own bid for power in the ROA after Vlasov's death. Whenever his beliefs lie, he now has to trial them between the hammer of the old guard resisting his seditious rhetoric and the anvil of his share and burden as a traitor."
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BUNYACHENKO_DESC: "Few men have contributed as much to the success of the Russian Liberation Army as much as Sergey Kuzmich Bunyachenko. A soldier of the Red Army since the age of 16, he saw combat in more fronts and battles than most, both in the Russian Civil War and in the Second World War. He would be a leading commander in the Caucasus, yet would find difficulty in turning the tide of war. Back at home, Bukharin's regime found him as a perfect scapegoat to blame the failures of the Red Army on, even if he was not the one to blame for the complete failure of the Soviet Union to defend itself. Soon, though, during a brave counter-attack, his division would be encircled and he would be captured.\n\nBunyachenko would remain in a penal colony separated from society until the infamous West Russian War. That was when he would request from the government he was at the mercy of to join in the fight against the WRRF and avenge the communists, who he harbored so much hatred for. He would fight bravely on the side of Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Army, until the ROA coalesced into its own warlord state in Samara. There, he would play a key role in governing the region and raising a proper military. This would eventually earn him a high position in the government, becoming Minister of Defense.\n\nWith the death of Vlasov, Bunyachenko has managed to rise to power in Samara. A militarist, Bunyachenko will not stop until the communists, and perhaps the Germans to the west as well, are dealt with. As the head of the KONR, he is glad to use it as long as it serves its interests. However, should he deem the committee to be an ineffective organ, Bunyachenko might have no problem with assuming control."
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BUNYACHENKO_70S_DESC: "Sergey Kuzmich Bunyachenko's life has been one of war without end. Having done the impossible and secured all of Russia under his control, Bunyachenko now fights a final, terrible struggle: the battle for legacy.\n\nUnder his watch an ordered society has taken shape within Russia. For many, President Bunyachenko is the lawgiver, the man who has given them homes, given their children schools, given their elderly parents pensions. His most loyal supporters are found within the ROA, the once despised German organized militia Bunyachenko found himself helping to lead during the West Russian War. For the ROA veterans Bunyachenko has brought them respect, purpose, and the dream of going home, of going west.\n\nFor many, this legacy of hope and progress rests precariously on a bed of lies, blood and ashes. Thousands of people once aligned with communist factions have disappeared. They are joined each week by dozens of those who agitate for worker's rights, for democracy, for accountability by a government and President who sees the population as naught but cogs within a military-industrial complex gone out of control. His harshest critics mock the former German dog as having replicated Moskowien's unfree society, at a much larger scale.\n\nSergey Bunyachenko fights for legacy. He dreams of washing the sins of his past, of being remembered as one of Russia's greatest patriots instead of as one of its greatest traitors. Yet as the weight of years grows on his shoulders, the military President increasingly fears that no man can be truly free from the crimes of the past. No matter what, however, Bunyachenko stands tall. He will face his fate heads on, fighting for his legacy until the very end."
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_OKTAN_DESC: "Charitably described as a 'complete bastard', Mikhail Alexandrovich Ilinich's ascendancy to the position of Chairman of the KONR marks the beginning of a new and dark chapter in Russia's story. Known by his pseudonym Oktan, he's cynical, manipulative and professing a slavish loyalty to the Reich, it is no surprise that he found his calling in managing the unruly Russians on behalf of his masters - first as a newspaper editor and self-proclaimed governor, then as chief propagandist of the KONR. Under his supervision, propaganda efforts after the West Russian War were ramped up tenfold, reeling in thousands of fervently anti-Bolshevik followers while driving out those loyal to a feeble, 'free' vision of Russia.\n\nFew would have foreseen his sudden rise to power, however. Once, Oktan was known as little more than a vicious, treasonous, anti-semitic drunk. Even in the early days, Oktan despised Vlasov for his softness and lack of radicalism, alienating the would-be dictator from his colleagues. His snivelling appeasement of the Germans and desperation to enter the ranks of the Russian Liberation Army's leadership ensured that when he finally began to climb the ranks, he faced staunch opposition from the camps of Zykov and Bunyachenko. His rivals spared no effort informing the people of his cowardice, laziness and lecherous conduct, but that effort came to naught.\n\nNow, they say nothing. Those who dare to whisper of Oktan's disloyalty to the Smolensk Declaration and the principles of the KONR soon find themselves arrested to face 're-education' - or worse. Having learned much from his past friendship with the Gestapo, Oktan has proven merciless and brutal in the suppression of his opposition and unwillingness to compromise on anything that might jeopardize his absolute rule. As a man who once enjoyed the full confidence of the Germans, there is no telling what horrors Oktan's rule might have in store for the people of Russia."
 SAM_The_Samara_Manifesto_desc: "In order to legitimize the ROA as an organization that hopes to unite the Russian people under one banner, the obsolete Smolensk Declaration has been discarded, and a new declaration, titled the Samara Manifesto, has been written.

 SAM.312.t: "人々の意思"
 SAM.312.desc: "Outside of a small village about two and a half hour's drive from the city of Samara lay, in a pile, roughly thirty dead bodies. Well over half of them were wearing the ROA's uniform, the other dead were clearly partisans. The confrontation between the partisans and the local patrol had taken place when a routine inspection of the village led to the discovery of weapons caches, partisans hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe firefight that ensued saw all of the partisans killed, but most of the patrol as well. The dead ROA, which featured kids as young as sixteen, was sorted into one pile, with another, far more uncouth, for the dead partisans, mostly young men and women. Vlasov, who was shocked to hear that there was such a coherent piece of communist resistance so close to the capital, drove out himself to see the aftermath.\n\nAccompanied by two of his bodyguards, he examined the carnage after personally ordering the surviving patrol members to not exact revenge on the surviving villagers. One of the bodyguards, Belochkin, was a personal confidant of the old general. He could tell that for the first time in a long time, Vlasov was filled with emotion - and none of it was good. His mouth formed into a tight-lipped grimace as he walked through the village. An explosion of anger eventually brought the usually laconic general into a yelling fit, shouting at the pile of dead partisans.\n\n\"Who are you to think that you could do what you tried to do?\" He asked and then paused. Was he waiting for a response? \"I have worked years - no, decades - to bring about a Russia free from communism, free from tyranny. And all you people who so stubbornly resist my efforts, indoctrinated by the bastards I beat years ago, you waste the lives of brave, young men who fight my good fight!\"\n\nBelochkin was stunned. He looked around, villager and soldier alike froze, observing the marshal's outburst. Glancing towards his fellow bodyguard, he slowly approached Vlasov, who had since fallen silent. Careful not to touch him, Belochkin quietly whispered in his ear.\n\n\"Perhaps, my chairman, it is time for us to go. I'm sure you're needed back in Samara.\"\n\nVlasov weakly agreed; the drive back to the capital was a very quiet one."

 SAM_bunyachenko.10.t: "Chasing the Sun"
 SAM_bunyachenko.10.desc: "The presidential palace had a certain glitz to it. The central wing, meant to impress foreign dignitaries, displayed arrays of artifacts and paintings gathered from all over free Russia. The late afternoon sun reflected off gilded furniture. It reflected from the mirror shine boots of smartly dressed soldiers of the army of national liberation, posted at regular intervals. It reflected from the mirrors. Guests unused to the effect often got dizzy from the endless radiance. They should have known better, reflected the President. In this accursed world, one rarely got better than half truths. Light only confirmed shadows, rather than dispel them.\n\nSergey Bunyachenko often paced the halls, away from his working office. What a contrast the central wing made to the President's more spartan quarters! The presidential office in particular was filled with neatly aligned filing cabinets. Golden baubles and other trinkets were for effete civilians. A thought came, unbidden, of Vlasov and his denuded office. The President sneered at the memory of Vlasov waiting for his death, his spirit broken.\n\nIn the distance the capital's lights were turning on one by one. Each day, more lights. Each day, more buildings. More cars. More homes, more factories. More of a future. The economic projections the President had just read hinted at the magnitude of what had been accomplished. Intelligence intercepts from the Pakt, the OFN and the CPS revealed the surprise, joy and consternation abroad at Russia's recovery.\n\nA pair of soldiers stood guard in the next hall. An odd pair, a youngster barely out of basic training, and an older man, from the Moskowien days. The kid was a tall lad. Young men like him all across Russia now had regular access to meat. Improved nutrition had helped them grow strong. They would make fine soldiers. The veteran next to him held his modern assault rifle wearily. His salute to the President was not as crisp as the youth's. Bunyachenko did not mind it too much. The old man had lived through it all, too. Bunyachenko returned their salute. Light and shadows surrounded the three soldiers as the sun continued its journey west."

 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.1.t: "The Greatest Showman"
 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.1.desc: "Mikhail Oktan stood in front of the mirror, twisting his face into the desired simulacra of human emotion. First, sadness at the passing of Adolf Hitler. Then, indignation at the collapse of the Pakt and cessation of German funding to KONR. Finally, an assuring smile to remind the Russians that KONR remained as a bastion of hope, a shining beacon of prosperity. Tomorrow, he would deliver a speech to the adoring masses of Samara; hopefully before Zykov and Bunyachenko could prepare their own statements. Taking a pause from his grimacing, Oktan dialed Rech, his personal propaganda machine in operation since Barbarossa. \"Hello-\"\n\n\"Oktan speaking. I need at least five men for tomorrow's rally, you know what for.\"\n\n\"I-Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe night following, Oktan stood before the assembled masses. Under the watchful rifles of Oktan's personal guard, the crowd cheered as the hero of all Russians finished his speech, sweat shining from his brow. Nervous smiles and frantic clapping rippled through the masses that had been \"encouraged\" to attend his rally. With a grin, the kleptocrat knew that his rivals could scarcely hope for such a turn out. Wiping the sweat from his brow and surrounded by his bodyguards, Oktan stepped down from the podium."

 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.2.t: "Mammon's New Clothes"
 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.2.desc: "Mikhail Oktan stepped from the back of the Mercedes, polished boots clicking smartly against the pavement. The guards outside the office of the general staff saluted crisply, trying to keep their eyes off the general's new uniform. It was unlike anything they had ever seen, truly unique. While the general form of the KONR uniform had been preserved, elements from the Reich had crept in. The high, stiff collar adorned with oak leaves, the gold frogging on the shoulders, and the gorget of silver were difficult to ignore, but they did their best. A rank insignia of unknown designation was proudly stitched to his breast.\n\n\"Jesus,\" muttered one of the guards just past the gate, \"I guess there's no accounting for taste.\"\n\nHis companion, stifling a chuckle, whispered, \"how much blood do you think he had to sell to afford that monstrosity?\" Both fell into stony-faced silence as the \"Head General of the Russian Liberation Army\" stepped past them. As he did so, Oktan looked directly into the eyes of each soldier in turn, an icy smile spreading over his face. All humor vanished, replaced by a pit of dread in their stomachs, their mouths drying in an instant."

 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.3.desc: "\"Sir,\" began the driver, \"I'm afraid we'll be a bit late.\"\n\nOktan leaned forwards in his seat towards the front of the Mercedes, \"why? Do I need to start looking for another chauffeur?\" Irritation laced his words like poison, the general's face twisted in a mask of contempt. He had planned this dinner weeks ago and hated the possibility of losing face with Samara's upper crust.\n\n\"No,\" replied the driver hastily, \"we left with plenty of time to spare, there are people blocking the road.\" Indeed, with voices and placards raised in anger, a throng of protestors had gathered in Samara's central square. Signs reading, \"down with Oktan!\" and \"Zykov for the people!\" and other such nonsense could be seen. The police, thank God, had already engaged the protestors, batons rising and falling with wet thumps. A path was steadily being cleared, but the general frowned impatiently as the Mercedes gently attempted to ford its way through the crowd. Progress was progress, he supposed.\n\nSuddenly, the car ground to a halt. \"What now?\" demanded Oktan.\n\n\"There's someone in the road.\" Sure enough, a young woman holding a placard with Zykov's face, held her hand out in front of the Mercedes.\n\n\"I will pay you fifty-thousand rubles to drive straight ahead.\"\n\n\"Sir?\" The driver's hands tightened on the wheel, knuckles white. \"You want me to-\"\n\n\"I assure you, Rech will tell the tale of how you heroically saved my life from a drugged-out Marxist, just get me there on time.\" The driver swallowed, foot pressing down on the accelerator."

 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.4.desc: "Kolzak lay on the concrete floor, the frigid rock numbing his flesh. He coughed, body shuddering, the sickness eating away at his lungs. The doctors had assured him that someone would be by to see him soon, but that had been hours ago. So this was the much vaunted life in the Mikhail Oktan Divisions: shivering and slowly hacking up bits of lung.\n\nHe supposed he couldn't expect much else. A week ago, Kolzakm had attempted to run, to flee Samara when Oktan had ascended to the throne of Samara. He had, of course, been captured before he reached the border, and just like every other Russian in Samara, had become a prisoner of the mad general. He coughed, blood leaking from his lips. Perhaps this was his death sentence, a delayed execution.\n\nGeneral Sorokin sighed, wiping a hand over his sweaty brow. The epidemic that had gripped his division had only now begun to abate after he had begun to separate the sick from the healthy. Medicine was a rare commodity in Samara, and a lowly recruit could not hope for treatment. Besides, Sorokin knew, Oktan's military henchmen hated to hear bad news. So, the sick died alone and the healthy remained ignorant."

 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.5.desc: "Sorokin struck the earth, shovel rapidly displacing earth. The Mikhail Oktan Division hunkered low beneath a raging stream of tracer fire, machine guns chattering out their anger. Next to him in the half-dug trench, men writhed and groaned in death-agony. Still, General Sorokin dug on, hoping that the next wave of reinforcements would arrive to find acceptable cover. The enemy had caught them with their pants down, launching a (even Sorokin had to admit) superb assault on their camp, and as men died and milled about in terrified confusion, Sorokin continued to dig. The radioman, his brains painted against the side of the ditch, his radio fouled by bullets, seemed to stare accusingly at the general. No help was coming.\n\nThe shrill whine known and feared by every soldier suddenly filled the air. Artillery! Sorokin flung himself to the earth, hands clasped over his head. The ditch exploded into clods of earth and chunks of men. Sorokin was hurled skywards, up becoming down, down becoming up. When the world stopped turning, he was flat on his back, tracers still whizzing overhead like so many fireflies. Ears ringing and head spinning, Sorokin pushed himself up. Looking down, he groaned in horror, his legs reduced to scraps of wet meat, his blood soaking the earth. Men ran in panic, the Mikhail Oktan Division reduced to screaming children. A soldier dashed past, and Sorokin reached out, grabbing onto the man's ankle. The soldier, fifteen at most, looked at the general with terrified eyes.\n\n\"Help me, please-\"\n\nThe boy cried out, kicking Sorokin full in the face as he made his escape. As men died around him, Sorokin allowed the darkness to shut its jaws."

 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.6.t: "In the Garden of Serpents"
 RUS.smuta.SAM.oktan.6.desc: "Nikita Korolev sipped his wine, the vintage pleasant on his tongue. It wasn't like anything he had tasted before and he wondered what price Oktan had paid to smuggle it in from the Reich. Mikhail Oktan himself, his gnomish face wrinkled in a smile, toasted Korolev from across the room, Korolev raising his own glass in turn. The room was fit to Oktan's tastes: all gilded and gaudy. Gold and silver dazzled in the candlelight, priceless antiques stood on pillars, and paintings by long dead masters hung on the walls. The table, a solid piece of marble, dominated the room, and not for the first time, Korolev wondered how on earth Oktan had managed to have the thing installed. These thoughts were distractions, empty considerations keeping him from thinking about his near betrayal of his master. Zykov had offered a great deal to turn on Oktan, and Korolev would be lying if he said he had not seriously considered it. He may have, though he suspected it couldn't be proven, given the Jew useful breadcrumbs about Oktan's organization in exchange for a modest sum.\n\n\"My dear Nikita,\" said Oktan, \"you have been at my side since the beginning. Whenever agitators threatened our efforts, whenever our charges refused to pay, I could always count on you. This dinner is for you, old friend. I never could have made it this far without you.\"\n\nKorolev smiled weakly, \"and I would still be a policeman in Moscow if it hadn't been for you, general. I owe you twice as much, at least.\"\n\nOktan's grin spread wider, becoming diabolical, his eyes glittering. \"My dear Nikita, you are correct. You owe me more than you could possibly repay. Though,\" Oktan set his glass down, \"perhaps paying me your twenty pieces of silver could be a start.\" Korolev blanched, this conversation was taking a most unpleasant turn. \"Did you think you would get away with it, Brutus?\" The smile was gone, replaced by a twisted sneer. Oktan stood up, palms flat on the cold marble. \"How stupid do you think I am? Did you think I wasn't always watching, Nikita? Did you think I would forgive you?\"\n\n\"Mikhail, please,\" began Korolev, but his worlds were stolen away by a sudden and violent seizure, his body convulsing, wine spilling over the marble like blood. As foam began to bubble from between his lips, Oktan stood over him.\n\n\"Idiot,\" he murmured, \"I don't lose, Korolev.\" Agony washed over Korolev's body as he flailed. He could feel his bowels emptying, his eyes and nose leaking blood."

 SAM.smuta.zykov.5.a: "But what about mine?"
 SAM.smuta.zykov.1.desc: "The time is 08:55. Five minutes. Did the KONR Headquarters' hallways always seem this long? Maybe they were, and he never noticed? This building... did the architects and the designers know what this building was going to be used for? Zykov speed-walked down the lobby, tugging along his briefcases - his arms gradually giving ground to total senselessness as the blood rushed out of his arms. Was it this one? Screeching to a halt, he stabbed his head through the doorway. All that met him was peeling wallpaper, broken glass and a map of what used to be Russia in 1914. No, that was too pessimistic. Pessimism was a disease that kept oppressors in power and the oppressed in shackles - he would not have gotten this far if he had succumbed to its vice. All that met Miletiy Zykov inside that winding path of the KONR HQ was peeling wallpaper, broken glass and what Russia WILL be once more. What has been lost, will not stay that way.\n\nThe time now was 08:59. Regardless, it was not the room he was looking for. The Cabinet? Where did he decide where to put the new Cabinet? Too tainted by the stench of the past - and the blood of Germany's conquests - he had decided to move the Cabinet from the top floor, overlooking the landscape, to somewhere else. Somewhere... lower? Shit! Was this their great new President? A man who couldn't even keep track of where his government was? Disgraceful. What if he had been wrong to take power? He was not capable of wielding it. Something was wrong with him. Was it a lust for power, violence, wealth? The greatest feat ever performed was trying to convince himself that he was any different from his peers. He was n-\n\nStumbling into the end of the corridor, Miletiy Zykov found his government. Huddled around a grand, ebony table - with a mash of papers, documents and maps - they awaited him. Maybe all of those things were true - that he was no better of a person than Oktan and the like. He wouldn't deny it. But as he looked at those men who had dedicated themselves to becoming a small part of a better Russia, a burden slipped from his shoulders."
 SAM_smuta_zykov_one_tt: "The first thing Zykov does is exhale."
 SAM.smuta.zykov.2.desc: "\"Next!\" Officer Lavro called out, though he hardly needed to do so, as the man next in line was eagerly approaching. The 'Emergency Office of Registration of Political Parties' had been busy ever since it had opened, and to Lavro, it all certainly felt like an emergency.\n\nWho would have thought that so many people would all want to come and register their own pet political party? He suspected that most of these were scams, but orders were orders, and he trusted Zykov knew what he was doing.\n\n\"Name, and party of registration,\" he said to the short man who approached. Today was the second visit for most of them, who had already submitted their requests for approval. Now they found out if they'd be permitted to run or not. It placed him in the position of being the bearer of good - or bad news.\n\n\"Denis Bazhenov,\" the man said. \"For the Liberal Party of Russia.\"\n\n\"Right, one moment.\" He took a few minutes to go and find the papers, mildly dreading the answer. Bold of the man to declare a liberal party, as those hadn't had good approval history. To his surprise, he found it was approved. \"Here you go,\" he handed it to the man. \"Congratulations.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" the man beamed, as he exited the room, and Lavro returned to work. It was only a while later, when a very different party was registered, did he realize that there'd been a mistake. It appeared he'd accidentally given the man the papers for the 'Democratic Party of Russia.' instead of the man's own.\n\nHe briefly thought about reporting it, but just sighed. There was too much to do, and trying to take back approval now would only cause more problems. Still, he was going to be much more careful looking at the papers in the future."
 SAM.smuta.zykov.3.desc: "\"Now is your opportunity, Russia!\" Christov called out on the street, a poster in hand. \"It is time the people had a voice! To speak truth to power! Join the Reform Movement, and we will bring the needed change to Russia!\"\n\nThe man's voice was strong, but restrained, and his face looked less confident than he sounded. As he shouted his slogans, holding a poster, and pouch full of leaflets slung over his shoulder, he certainly stood out from the crowd. His head darted one direction, then another in rapid succession, as if watching out for someone to come for him.\n\nYet no one did.\n\nHe tensed as a pair of soldiers walked by, and braced himself for the arrest to come, but... it never did. The soldiers just laughed at him, snickering to one another as they left. He heard the word 'crazy' muttered, but outside of that, nothing happened. His heart still raced every time he saw a soldier or police officer - at any other point in the past, he'd have been arrested by now.\n\nInstead, he was able to finish his day of campaigning, and even talked to a few prospective voters, all without interruption. As the sun began to set, he made his way back home, marveling at how much was different, and for once, feeling optimistic about the future. As he opened the door, his wife came out, her expression relieved and confused at the same time.\n\n\"You're back!\" She said, embracing him, clearly relieved. They'd argued over if he should do this, if Zykov could be trusted, and in the end he'd resolved it was better to try, than cower in fear.\n\n\"How did it go?\" She finally asked, and as he sat down, he took a moment before answering."
 SAM.smuta.zykov.4.desc: "Timofeevka was not a place where people usually traveled. A village which was so isolated that there were few existing administrative systems at all, primarily managed by a single mayor. This was something that the men in the car traveling to the city-village intended to rectify, as part of Zykov's reforms. They intended to speak to this mayor on setting up a democratic system; one to some official standards.\n\nOr that was the plan, until the car had broken down.\n\nNow stranded on the road, the bureaucrats argued amongst themselves about what to do next. It was too far to walk the rest of the way, nor did any of them want to do that to begin with. At the same time, they weren't close enough to any nearby city either. Fortunately, they heard the sounds of an approaching vehicle, and hushed themselves.\n\n\"Something I can help you with, gentlemen?\" The driver, a somewhat unkempt man asked out his rolled-down window, eyeing the well-dressed men stranded on the road curiously. The men quickly explained where they were doing, and what they intended to do - and asked for a ride to Timofeevka.\n\nThe man was familiar with the small village, and when the men told him they were here to implement Zykov's reforms, he perked up. There hadn't been many politicians who impressed him, but he had to admit that Zykov was getting things done, things he approved of. That he was doing the same for little Timofeevka was yet more proof of his commitment.\n\nHe gestured for the men to come into his car. It'd be a tight squeeze, but they'd all manage fine."
 SAM.smuta.zykov.5.desc: "This was not a place that he recognised. Willing himself to creak open his eyes, Zykov woke in a field. How long had he been asleep? The sky was not the pale blanket he was used to - the oppressive grey smothering the land in its infinite indifference. Rolling clouds, seeming to almost trip over themselves, dominated the sky, which had now transformed into the colour and consistency of quicksilver. If one squinted, they could make out faces within the teeming mass, which evaporated almost as quickly as it came. They were - in equal measures - pained and terrified as if fighting for their lives as if they desperately wanted to reach out and scream:\n\n\"Please, God... don't kill me...\" Zykov muttered without noticing. Falling back to his knees, a sharp pain struck him as if his brain was slamming itself against the inside of his skull. White streaks stabbed into his vision, and he buckled wildly to stop what felt like the worst pain he had ever felt. He was dying and being born, all at the same time. Again and again and again and agai-\n\nThis was not a place he recognised. Zykov woke up with a start. Only the Sun remained. It was bigger, brighter than anything he had seen before like he was staring into the heart of the Universe. Despite the agony it caused, just looking at it, he could not look away. Why couldn't he look away? Daring a glance, the answer lay there. Billions of them lay there. Bodies, their limbs bent and stretched in inhuman proportions, latched onto him like they were holding him back from something. He was on a mountain full of them - a winding peak that had no bottom. Now he understood. They were dragging him down. It was the corner of his mind that was most familiar. This was a place he recognised after all.\n\nZykov fluttered his eyelids apart. He had a paper stuck to his face, which he delicately peeled off. It was that dream again. Looking at the document, he mouthed the words \"Declaration of the Intention for the First National Russian Election\". Groggily taking a pen, he signed his signature on the dotted line. Russia would have a bright future, and nobody would have to live in fear again. That chapter of their life was over."

 SAM_The_Voice_of_Reason_desc: "In the ensuing political confrontation, Miletiy Zykov, the ideological voice of the Committee and the passionate voice for democracy, achieved the goodwill of the venerable Chairman Vlasov and rose to the rank of the 'second man' in the KONR. Few expected such a contentious figure to become the designated heir to Vlasov, but it seems that his radical ideas and appeal to the people brought the head propagandist of Samara far more weight to his bid for power than his enemies could ever expect.\n\nOf course, the favor of the old general is not enough to protect Zykov from attacks by rivalling factions. Many members of the KONR, especially the more conservative members of Oktan's faction, have barely concealed their contempt for the \"daydreaming demagogue\". The usually apolitical Bunyachenko faction have, unusually, also expressed dismay at Zykov's election. The new Deputy Chairman has yet to prove his worth, but no matter what it takes, Zykov will make every effort to accomplish the goals the Russian liberation movement was founded upon - the overthrowing of tyranny, wherever it may be, and the creation of a new, free Russia, one without Bolsheviks and any exploiters of the Russian blood."

The officer's clique and Bunyachenko agree with us that we need at least a small amount of popular support if we're to succeed. We must convince them that offering a democratic Russia is the best path forward."

Even more important is his influence within the officer corps, as his years of dedicated service have made him a popular, non controversial figure.\n\nIt is thus crucial that we begin talks with him, and attempt to bring him closer to our democratic aims.

As befits any true historical hero, Vlasov's biography is full of wrongful and controversial decisions, and many deprecate him for his mistakes, but they will not be the judges of the Motherlands History.\n\nThe stagnation of the internal affairs in Samara caused many people, including both the elite of the Committee and the common Russian folk, to turn on General Vlasov for his alleged apathy to the needs of Russia and his inability to govern the KONR, but his authority among the new Russian government is still indisputable.

 SAM_Begin_the_Unification_desc: " With our internal situation under control, we must now begin our wars of unification. No longer mere hunting dogs for the German, we of the ROA must proudly accept our destiny as liberators of Russia. If every Russian is to live free of fear and oppression, then we must not fail! Soldiers, citizens, onward!"
 SAM_The_Committee_Prevails: "委員会の勝利"
 SAM_The_Committee_Prevails_desc: "Amid a significant amount of political turmoil among Samara's elite, the committee of officers responsible for making all of our statelet's important decisions has decided its successor. Even with Zykov advocating his idealistic \"democracy\" and General Oktan promoting the worst kinds of corruption, the committee has thankfully chosen the rational path and nominated Sergey Bunyachenko as the new head of the ROA.\n\nGeneral Bunyachenko is competent and disciplined, perfect for the continuation of the ROA's mission. His first task: to restore stability to our fractured political situation, remind the various officers who really is in charge, and begin shaping the ROA into a force capable of governing."
 SAM_Work_with_Zykov: "ズィコフとの連携"
 SAM_Work_with_Zykov_desc: "Although we all accept the leadership of General Vlasov, the ROA has substantial internal factions, each with its own idea of how best to run Samara. General Bunyachenko, for instance, is a fairly standard advocate of a single-party right wing state. Zykov, on the other hand, has far more peculiar opinions. Zykov is an unabashed liberal who campaigns relentlessly for greater democratization. The fact that he had to collaborate with the Third Reich to do so does not seem to faze him.\n\nAlthough we see eye to eye on very few issues, our faction and his do have the capacity to reconcile. Zykov's supporters, more than anything, desire at least surface-level improvements in the common people's situation. If we can achieve the veneer of progress, we may be able to form a mutually beneficial relationship."
 SAM_Nominate_Him: "ズィコフの指名"
 SAM_Nominate_Him_desc: "Miletiy Zykov is an impressively principled advocate of democracy. His soaring speeches and firm convictions make him one of our greatest assets in terms of propaganda, performing sorely needed work to rectify the Russian people's perception of the ROA as traitors and assets of the Reich. He is also a snake who should not be trusted with any position of power, lest he steer our army towards his mad dreams of liberalism.\n\nNevertheless, snakes have their uses. Zykov's way with words makes him the only major politician in Samara with any form of public support. Giving him a prestigious yet powerless sinecure will show the people that we have their best interests in mind, or at least convince them that we do."
 SAM_Celebrate_Vlasov: "ウラソフを祝う"
 SAM_Celebrate_Vlasov_desc: "Ah, the great General Vlasov--what an underappreciated man! He defected from the criminal Red Army and brilliantly played the Reich in order to gain the leverage to liberate Samara from the Bolshevik scourge. Now he benevolently leads the ROA, preparing to one day liberate Russia from communism once and for all! Unfortunately, the vast majority of Samara's population does not quite see the situation this way. Most believe him to be a German toady and a traitor to the nation.\n\nIf we are to gain any sort of legitimacy, we need to combat the false narratives about our leader and founder. With the help of Zykov and his propagandists, we can tell the Russian people that Vlasov is a hero worthy of respect. In time, they may even believe us."
 SAM_First_Among_Equals: "同輩中の首席"
 SAM_First_Among_Equals_desc: "The officers' committee that runs Samara is a democratic institution of ROA generals committed to managing the liberation of Russia. However, as in any organization, certain figures are likely to become disproportionately prominent. General Vlasov, of course, is our most respected leader, owing to his heroism in fighting the Soviets. However, General Bunyachenko has himself rapidly risen in importance following his election by the committee.\n\nTo the uneducated masses, this might appear to be evidence that Samara is a military dictatorship, where power is consolidated in the hands of one man. This is naturally a misconception, but one that needs to be corrected to increase trust in our government. Bunyachenko is merely the first among equals, obeyed out of admiration rather than fear. At least, not yet."
 SAM_Demote_Maltsev: "オクタンの降格"
 SAM_Demote_Maltsev_desc: "The generals of the ROA are loathed by many Russians as traitors and collaborators, and none more so than Mikhail Oktan. Oktan embodies every negative characterization of our organization; he is corrupt, sleazy, greedy, and infamously close to the Germans. Overall, a man of shockingly little moral fiber. He drags Samara down with every day he spends in its senior ranks, but is disconcertingly influential among some less scrupulous officers.\n\nNeutralizing Oktan as a powerful player in the ROA's politics is a necessity in order to limit the corrosive influence he has on our discipline and popularity. A demotion should do wonders to cut him down to size, as well as showing the skeptical populace that we are capable of dealing with bad actors within our hierarchy."
 SAM_Sideline_the_Germans: "Sideline the Germans"
 SAM_Sideline_the_Germans_desc: "Out of all the brands and slanderous titles that have been applied to Vlasov and the ROA, none have been more devastating than the accusations that we are German-backed traitors to the motherland. Also quite devastating is the fact that they are entirely true. In order to strike out against the Bolsheviks, General Vlasov made a tactical alliance with the Third Reich. Inconveniently, many German advisors sent over during this period are still present and fairly visible.\n\nThe advisors have been far more trouble than they are worth. We have all the weapons we need, and the Reich is not exactly a reliable partner. In the long run, erasing all remnants of our collaboration with Germany will redeem us in the eyes of the Russian people, and our legitimacy as a nation is far more important than our reputation in the eyes of a country that seeks to keep Russia weak and divided."
 SAM_The_Committee_Looks_Outward: "The Committee Looks Outward"
 SAM_The_Committee_Looks_Outward_desc: "Ever since the Tatars were conquered a long, long time ago, they have been an integral part of the Russian nation. However, with the unfortunate collapse of the country, they believe they have a chance to rise again. We must prove them that this is their greatest mistake. They are our neighbor, and so it shall be easy for the great Russian Liberation Army to march on and crush any hopeless resistance they offer. The time has come for this futile separatist effort to end, and for the Russian flag to fly high over Kazan once again."
 SAM_The_Kormchiy_Rises: "The Trail of Fortune"
 SAM_The_Kormchiy_Rises_desc: "Now's the time, now's the hour. The venerable chairman Vlasov has chosen commander Oktan as his heir. Gone are the years of stagnation and weakness. The ROA now belongs to men of action.\n\nMuch remains to be done, our hold on power is still tentative. Our rivals are still powerful. We must mold the ROA to our needs to ensure Russia's future... as well as our own interest.\n\nThe Zykovites as well as the officers committee must be put in their place. We must strike now preventively to catch them off guard. Good thing that Deputy-Chairman Oktan has kept a long list of contacts and resources for just such a moment."
 SAM_Sideline_Our_Rivals: "Sideline Our Rivals"
 SAM_Sideline_Our_Rivals_desc: "As long as Bunyachenko and Zykov plot our downfall, our political program will be in danger. We must thus sideline them to secure our position\n\nIt would be ill advised to try a power move against these men while our enemies lurk beyond the border. The best move, for now, is to begin reducing their influence and make it clear to the officers of the ROA that from now on, promotion and wealth can only come from aiding Oktan."
 SAM_Erase_Their_Legacies: "Erase Their Legacies"
 SAM_Erase_Their_Legacies_desc: "It's always a bit awkward to purge political rivals with long illustrious careers of service to the nation. Zykov is, if not beloved, then cautiously liked by the civilians of Samara for his propaganda speeches on democracy and the importance of a free Russia. Bunyachenko, on the other hand, is popular with the soldiers for his exploits in the West Russian War.\n\nBy beginning a campaign of propaganda, we can polish our leader's image while slowly erasing the legacy of these two trouble makers."
 SAM_Turn_Their_Supporters: "Turn Their Supporters"
 SAM_Turn_Their_Supporters_desc: "Bunyachenko and Zykov have die hard supporters; some men really do believe in the bizarre democratic dream; others feel that an allegedly just and fair general like Bunyachenko really is the ROA's best chance at saving Russia.\n\nThankfully, many more officers are honest in that they chose the horse that seemed most likely to win the race. After Oktan's ascension, these men have stayed loyal to Zykov and Bunyachenko's side out of a desire to be on the winning team when the round of musical chair end.\n\nThese men can be persuaded to change side, were we to make a better offer than their current boss. Oktan has accumulated quite a sum of money and good quantity of land for such an occaison. By doling out payments, we can trim our rival's power for the time being"
 SAM_Our_Eternal_Leader: "Our Eternal Leader"
 SAM_Our_Eternal_Leader_desc: "Our efforts against Bunyachenko and Zykov are paying dividends. While neither men are out of the game yet, their powerbase has significantly shrunk. The ROA is now mostly united in purpose, supporting Oktan's dream of crushing bolshevism and restoring a strong Russia to the forefront... And rewarding the hero liberators of the ROA with land and money beyond their wildest dreams."
 SAM_Use_My_Foes: "Use Our Foes"
 SAM_Use_My_Foes_desc: "While it may be tempting to strike now, the truth is that Zykov and Bunyachenko both dream of a united Russia, with them at the command. As such, while the Russian wars of unification are beginning, it may prove simplest to make use of our enemies while they are still useful. Both men are skilled and hard working, and while their vision for the future pales when compared to the Deputy Chairman's plans, they are still our comrades for the time being."
 SAM_My_Voice: "Oktan's Voice"
 SAM_My_Voice_desc: "No one quite knows what to make of Zykov. An eccentric man of uncertain past, agitating for a democratic future in Russia.\n\nFor Oktan, it is clear what Zykov is: a dangerous quixotic fool, but a charismatic one. The so-called friend of the people has convinced many other ROA officers about his democratic dream, and the importance of treating civilians well.\n\nIt would thus by best for Zykov to stay very close to Oktan. The general's oratory skills can be used to help change the ROA's image from bloodthirsty collaborators to humble liberators of the Russian nation. Of course, Zykov's message of democracy and power to the people will have to be thoroughly excised from our propaganda efforts."
 SAM_My_Generals: "Oktan's Generals"
 SAM_My_Generals_desc: "General Bunyachenko is a skilled man, and his entourage contains some of the best commanding officers of the ROA. As such, if we can get Bunyachenko's reluctant backing, his officer friends will serve our cause as we expand out of Samara.\n\nIn time, the glory of conquest and the sweet rewards of land and money will erode these officers loyalty to Bunyachenko, and make them much better disposed to the Deputy Chairman. The ones that cannot be turned will simply receive nothing."
 SAM_My_Committee: "Oktan's Committee"
 SAM_My_Committee_desc: "With Bunyachenko and Zykov nominally backing us, many officers of the committee have jumped onboard Oktan's coalition.\n\nAs our political worries wind down, we can finally begin moving forward. The final few opponents we have can be ostracized, and the final few undecided men can be brought aboard our group. When the war begins, this shaky coalition will be solidified as honor and glory fall on all that follow the Komrchiy."
 SAM_My_Russia: "Oktan's Russia"
 SAM_My_Russia_desc: "As Vlasov's designated successor, and with a great majority of the ROA following him, Oktan is finally ready to begin his campaign to free western Russia.\n\nHis program is simple: a strong Russia led by strong men. Following his reorganization of Samara, general Oktan wishes to be the undisputed ruler of all of Russia. Our nation will be divided into military districts, ran by a stratocracy of skilled and loyal officers. Our soldiers will fight for glory, and for the chance to make a killing expropriating the wealth of bolsheviks and other degenerates. Already men flock to the banner of the rejuvenated ROA. Like the Roman legionaries of old, our soldiers will march to the end of the world for a promise of a patch of land to call their own in the greatest empire on Earth."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.1.desc: "Sleep was something that refused to come, and Bunyachenko resigned himself to the fact that it wasn't going to change.\n\nWith a groan, he arose from his bed after several fruitless hours attempting to sleep, and rubbed his eyes, as he sat at the edge of his bed. Truthfully, he should have expected sleep would be impossible. The idea of rest in any context seemed laughable right now - and it wasn't simply because the Germans had cut off their supplies - effectively leaving them on their own.\n\nIt was more than that; it was something personal. That news brought memories; memories that he had tried to bury.\n\nMemories of the war; the unrelenting horror and terror as they fought the German bulwark. Memories of his time as a German prisoner of war, and the humiliation that accompanied it. Memories of being brought before a Nazi officer, who presented him a very simple offer - serve or die.\n\nHe'd accepted the deal the devil offered, if only so he could live. There hadn't been any more noble reason than that.\n\nMany emotions consumed him as the memories resurfaced; emotions of fear, loathing, and regret - but one which rose higher than all of them was anger. Some anger directed at himself - but greater fury directed towards the Germans for all that they'd done, and for using and discarding them so easily.\n\nBut perhaps this was an opportunity in disguise. Now they could break from the Germans completely. Now, perhaps, he could begin undoing the damage caused by the tyrants who had ruled before. Bunyachenko stood, and after some consideration, dressed for the day. There was work to do, and if he could not sleep, he had best get started."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.2.desc: "General Belyakov was a man who made a poor first impression. While ROA soldiers were held to certain physical standards, it seemed like Belyakov had been exempted. That he was noticeably larger and out of shape would have been bad enough, were it also not compounded by his unprofessionalism. Parts of his uniform were untucked, dirty, and wrinkled. Bunyachenko's opinion hadn't improved as the talk had continued.\n\n\"My question is very simple,\" Bunyachenko rephrased his question a third time as they walked in front of a line of the Belyankov's soldiers, all of whom stood at attention. \"When we commence operations, what is your contingency for coordinating with the Sixth and Fourth Divisions in the event of operational roadblocks?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it's not an easy question to answer,\" Belyakov was sweating, and his voice was unsteady, knowing full well he didn't have an answer. \"You see, it requires-\"\n\nBunyachenko sighed, not in the mood to hear another rambling answer that betrayed his incompetence. By now he'd heard enough. He lifted a hand, cutting the general off as he looked at a nearby ROA captain who'd doubtless been listening. \"Answer the question.\"\n\nThe man snapped to attention. \"Sir, in the event of an offensive stalemate, we would entrench ourselves along the secondary fallback position by the river, and attempt to establish radio communications with the respective divisions. Encirclement mitigation would follow, should I continue, sir?\"\n\n\"No. And thank you, captain,\" Bunyachenko nodded in approval, returning his attention to the general. \"You have no business holding command of these soldiers, General. How you gained this position, I do not know - but I will not have my men be led by one as incompetent as you.\" He stepped forward, and decisively removed the General's badge."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.3.desc: "The quotas had always been high at Dimitry's factory. It was just something that he, and everyone who worked in it, had come to expect. The quotas on their own weren't bad on their own - the work he could handle, and in fact he enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment as weapons rolled off the line.\n\nWhat he didn't like was that it was never enough.\n\nThe man the ROA had appointed as their overseer was a hard, harsh man who seemed more concerned with making their lives miserable, than actually making sure they did good work. They'd learned that whenever he left his office to walk the lines to just keep their heads down and work even harder.\n\nEvery day they just hoped that the man would just remain in his office. It was a prayer that was only answered sometimes. They'd all resigned themselves to the fact that he would be their overseer forever, until one day, he wasn't there anymore.\n\nDimitry and the rest of the workers were initially confused, until the man - a short, wiry man from a nearby city, and who seemed to have a far milder temperament - explained that he had been appointed to take over overseeing duties as part of some new policies from the government.\n\nThey had been cautious at first, but after a few days with this new overseer, they began to have their hope vindicated, and this new overseer he was far more lenient and respectful. He still expected the quotas - but that was something they were more than happy to fulfill.\n\nThey didn't know what had prompted this new President Bunyachenko to pursue these policies - but for the first time since Dimitry could remember, he felt that he could support this new Samaran leader."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.4.desc: "The cell was a cold, lonely place. All the same, Stanislav knew that it could be worse. Given the stories he'd heard of the ROA during his service, he'd honestly expected that his time on Earth would be short after his capture. Prisoners of war were often not treated well - especially ones who fell into the hands of a group that was known to have been supported by the Germans.\n\nHowever, despite his fears, things were... not what he'd expected.\n\nIt wasn't as though his treatment had been the pinnacle of hospitality - but his cell was relatively clean, if cold. Food was regular, if bland. The guards were dismissive, but not abusive. It didn't make a lot of sense. Had all of the rumors been wrong, or had something changed here recently?\n\nA commotion in the hall caught his attention, and Stanislav's eyes widened as he saw a ranking ROA officer, with a couple subordinates, approach the cell. Even more surprising was when he unlocked it, opening the cell door.\n\n\"Lieutenant Stanislav Kosorukov,\" the officer's voice was gruff, but clear. \"Your sentence has been commuted upon your consent to an immediate transfer to the Sixteenth ROA Division, in service of the legitimate Russian state under President Bunyachenko.\"\n\nStanislav blinked several times in confusion, unable to speak at first. Had there been a mistake? \"I...\" he coughed, clearing his voice. \"I'm being freed, in return for military service?\"\n\nThe officer nodded calmly. \"Correct. Upon the direct orders of President Bunyachenko, all existing prisoners of war are to be evaluated, and if certain criteria are met, integrated into the service. Now, do you accept this offer?\" It was a question he did not have to ponder for very long."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.5.desc: "The sun was setting, and only a few rays of light illuminated the streets as Bunyachenko walked to his house. The work days were long, at least for now, but they were necessary. It was past time the people had someone who truly worked for them, and there were many who now relied upon him.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir?\"\n\nBunyachenko turned at the voice, seeing a man cautiously approach him. His escort moved in front of him, but Bunyachenko stopped them with a raised hand. The man was older, perhaps in his early forties, with a disheveled beard and hair - but who stood up straight, and with a voice didn't waver. Bunyachenko cocked his head, appraising him. \"Yes, how can I help you?\"\n\n\"You already have,\" the man said. \"My name is Lukyan, and only a few months ago I was on the streets. I had no future; I was struggling, and I expected I would die. You helped change that. Because of you, I found work at a factory. I have a place to live now, I can see a future. You saved my life, I would only like to shake your hand.\"\n\nA genuine smile crossed Bunyachenko's face. He stepped forward, and took the extended hand, shaking it firmly. \"I'm glad to have helped. That is all I've tried to do.\"\n\nBoth men exchanged a few more words, with Bunyachenko promising to visit the factory he worked at in the future. After they parted ways, Bunyachenko entered his home, the smile still on his face.\n\nIt was one thing to hear, it didn't compare to seeing the lives changed in person. It was validating to know he was making a real difference, and that there were many who had been able to reclaim their lives because of him; many who now had hope in a better future. This, he knew, was only the beginning."

 SAM_Reformed_officer_corps: "Reformed Officer Corps"
 SAM_Reformed_officer_corps_desc: "The ROA has always been weighed down by its overly large and factional officer corps. The political influence it wielded in the past made it difficult to seriously reform our command structure, as bickering and conspiracies muddled our mission and made us vulnerable. Though less threatening now that the situation has stabilized, the officers represent a potential source of future opposition to our rule, and collect far more in salary money than can be justified given our resources.\n\nAs well as eliminating the more politically unreliable elements of our military, streamlining the officer corps is simply good practice. A less clunky and top-heavy military can only be beneficial. After all, any future factional infighting would destabilize the chain of command and potentially be a death blow to our government."
