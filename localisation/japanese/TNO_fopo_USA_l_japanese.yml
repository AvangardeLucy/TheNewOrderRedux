Now, how our Generals didn't foresee this becoming an issue is almost shocking, yet here we are again, cleaning up a hell of a mess we shouldn't even have. The only issue is going to be to build up all the ports, bases, airports, and a thousand other things, I'm sure.\n\nThe one thing the historian pundits will ever talk about when it came to the last war is logistics, you know, logistics we won and lost on, logistics of England, logistics of Asia, logistics of logistics.

Our allies don't have it as good as we do, and we know this because the poor bastards are struggling to supply their soldiers in South Africa. They're tough sonsofbitches and all for what it's worth, but we need to fix this before the Nazis grind them up.\n\nMcNamara compiled his mathematics—no, statistics, whatever the hell he does—and his reports all say that military infrastructure is a goddamn mess. If we build it up and make it efficient and all that, we'll be making sure that our allies can contribute everything they can to the war. We'll have an easier time keeping South Africa on its feet, and the bastards will have America to thank for that."

Now, we're in a position to retaliate, to bomb the hell out of them, and to push into their own land, and that's exactly what we're going to do.

The United States Congress couldn't prosecute a goddamn war if it tried. We learned that in the 1940s and in every war prior.\n\nLuckily, Presidents have found a way around the incompetence of the other branch. They've learned how to use executive orders and \"emergency declarations\" to do all sorts of things that limp-wristed senators would never vote to approve. Why, we can \"mobilize industries\" to bolster national security. We can \"affect troop movements\" in our capacity as commander-in-chief. We can reorder society itself in pursuit of the \"national interest.\"\n\nAll of it is possible with a single stroke of the President's pen. All of it is in our control."

Thankfully, the power of airpower has provided us with an alternative.\n\nWith near total control over the skies of Southern Africa, the path has been cleared for a round-the-clock campaign of aerial bombardment conducted by the Air Force and Navy.

 USA_colombia.1.d: "TOP SECRET [GetDateText]\nFROM DIRK HOLDEN\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\n(TS) POSITION: The escalation of new skirmishes in Colombia suggests a full resumption of hostilities in the country. The particular area of fighting provides the potential to secure a port for military aid to our allies.\n\n(TS) SIGNIFICANCE: Full-scale warfare has broken out in the Atlántico department of Colombia between the government, the fascist state of New Granada, and our allies in the Colombian Revolutionary Union. Said department is home to a large port which would help supply our partners with material aid.\n\nSuch material aid would help them someday control the entirety of the country and establish a friendly regime in the state. Furthermore, the potential acquisition of the department and its port by New Granada, or the retention by the central government could prove advantageous to our enemies in Asia and Europe.\n\n(TS) COURSE OF ACTION: Additional armaments and supplies through friendly Venezuela are prepared for transportation to help our allies in their aim to secure control. Successful operations would allow for the discontinuation of the costly supply route for the more favorable port."

This development puts us in a better situation to supply our allies.\n\n(TS) SIGNIFICANCE: After recent escalations over the last few days in the Civil War in Colombia, colloquially known as \"La Violencia\" Members of the Colombian Revolutionary Union or URC in the fighting have managed to gain control of the Atlántico department and with it, its large port in Cartagena.\n\nCartagena, founded in the 16th century is home to modern docking and unloading facilities that prove more efficient than our current supply routes through Venezuela. This development presents a promising and advantageous situation for future operations in the country.\n\n(TS) ADDENDUM: With this new situation, further shipments and aid are prepared to be sent to the URC. In the case of even greater escalation, troop deployment is now possible through the port. Other new operations may present themselves to be available as a result of this development as the situation evolves."

 USA_colombia.3.d: "TOP SECRET [GetDateText]\nFROM DIRK HOLDEN\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\n(TS) POSITION: Reports from inside the URC and from US Navy ships in the region conclusively indicate that the URC have lost the recent series of skirmishes in the Atlántico department. With this loss, they have been forced to evacuate their foothold on the Guajira Peninsula and to flee across the border into Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has declared its intention to provide safe harbor to any civilians and URC personnel fleeing combat, which has boosted the waning morale among our allies.\n\n(TS) SIGNIFICANCE: These events are a serious detriment to our interests in the region, and are a major blow to the URC in the Colombian Civil War. The strategically critical port of Cartagena now lies beyond our allies' grasp, and their only holdout, however strong it may be, is now in the distant southern reaches of the country.\n\n(TS) ADDENDUM: Given the severity of this new situation, our strategy must be subjected to a sweeping reevaluation. I would advise immediate relief for URC troops in the Guajira Peninsula from the Panama-based naval command, as well as a rapid shift towards providing material and quality aid to their compatriots in the south via Venezuela. Destabilization efforts in other Colombian regimes should be ramped up as well to ensure exploitable openings arise within a reasonable time frame."

 USA_SAF_WAR_Insurgent_Decision_Category_desc: "We have won a great victory for democracy in South Africa, but our work is far from finished. While the German army is defeated, remnants of their forces still fight on. In addition, many local warlords have established their own forces, and would like nothing better than expel us from their lands. Victory in Africa means nothing if we cannot stabilize the continent.\n\nSome of our officers have suggested continuing our strategy of attrition, using overwhelming firepower and superior tactics to eliminate as many rebels that we can while minimizing our own losses. However, diplomatic officials have suggested using a softer touch to win over the natives, which they claim will stabilize the continent better in the long term. Whichever approach we take, the public demands that our young men return home soon, and leave a stable continent behind. If we fail to satisfy the public, we will surely suffer at the polls."

But now that Windhoek and Quelimane lie in our hands, and the old German colonial barons have been chased from power, the question remains... what now?\n\nAmerica now leads the OFN occupation of much of the African continent, which has both costs and benefits. There is plenty of strategic advantage to be gained here, along with the vast amounts of resources that Africa has to offer. But there are also numerous insurgencies that are still ongoing, from rogue German guerrillas to native Africans who resent our continued presence. If we find ourselves drawn into yet another quagmire, even those who supported the initial war may become dissatisfied. The insurgencies must be brought to heel, before Africa becomes a widening gyre from which escape is impossible.\n\nOur Domestic discontent is currently [GetSAWDomesticDiscontent].\n\nThe stability of the mandates are at §Y[?ANG.OFN_MANDATE_rebel_stability]§! for §BSouthwest Africa§!, §Y[?COG.OFN_MANDATE_rebel_stability]§! for §GCentral Africa§!, and §Y[?MZB.OFN_MANDATE_rebel_stability]§! for §REast Africa§!.
