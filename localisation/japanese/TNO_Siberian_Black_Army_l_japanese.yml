 POLITICS_SIBERIAN_SOVIET_DESC: "ソビエト連邦の崩壊に伴い、アンガラ川流域に住む人々はモスクワの支配からの独立を果たした。独立後彼らが初めにしたことは、真の社会主義者の流儀に従い、評議会を結成することであった。旧ソビエト連邦時代の行政機関の多くはそのまま稼働していたが、配給を行うための物資がなかった。連邦内の他地域からの供給が停止していたのだ。だが、彼らは節約し、現地の代用品に置き換えることで、この問題を解決した。この時点で、既に西ロシアにおけるソ連政府との連絡は失われていた。中央シベリア共和国の「民主的な」臨時政府を承認するわけにはいかなかった。まして、専制的なヤゴーダ政権の傘下に入るなど論外であった。そこで彼らは人民の自由を守るべく、民兵隊を結成した。かくして、一度は忘れ去られたアナーキズムの思想は「シベリア無政府主義ソビエト」として、ロシアの辺境の地に再び蘇ったのだった。\n\n外の脅威が弱まるにつれて、黒衛軍は「無政府軍国主義」を掲げ、ソビエトにおける指導的な地位を獲得していった。黒衛軍は市民たちにとって不可欠なものとなり、そして彼らは革命を外部に輸出するための軍隊へと変化していった。\n\nアナーキズムと矛盾する軍国主義の広がりは、黒衛軍とソビエトとの間に大きな摩擦を引き起こしている。自由を守る軍隊が、人々の自由を奪ってはならないのだから。"
 POLITICS_KHAKASSIA_SECURITY_COUNCIL_DESC: "安全保障委員会が権力を掌握したことは、多くの人々に衝撃を与えた。母なるアナーキーは、今なお皆の心の中に息づいていたのだ。その変化は外部の人間には特に重大なものと思われなかったが、シベリアの市民にとってそれは由々しき事態であった。「自由は守られるのか？」という、極めて大きな問題が突き付けられたのだ。\n\nシベリアの支配者となった将校たちの手によって、自治区の目標は当初のものから大きくかけ離れたものとなった。専制政治の抑圧を受けた人民によって、専制と戦うべく結成された自治区は、イヴァン・ステパノフ将軍の陰謀によって、変質してしまったのである。\n\n中央シベリア共和国との戦いの中で、ステパノフは頭角を現していった。彼はヤゴーダ方面軍の師団長であったが、ロシア人同士の戦いを嫌っていた。そこで彼はクラスノペフツェフと協力した。ステパノフが師団を掌握し、クラスノペフツェフが大衆の支持を獲得していった。\n\nステパノフは政権を掌握した。長い道のりだったが、こうして評議会は無力化され、そこには形だけのものが残された。"

 POLITICS_MONGUSH_BUYAN_BADYRGY_DESC: "The former Chairman of the Council of Ministers and presumed successor to Donduk Kuular in the old Tuvan People's Republic, Mongush Buyan-Badyrgy leads a people that have long been neglected and forgotten. Enduring through the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva emerged as an independent state, sending what little aid they could to the Mongolian People's Republic to hold off the imperialist Japanese forces. Yet in spite of the efforts of the Tuvan and Mongolian people, Ulaanbaatar fell to the invaders, and many in Kuular's government feared Kyzyl would be next.\n\nSo, when Red Army forces arrived in Tuva, this was received as nothing short of a blessing. The request that the Tuvan People's Republic would become subordinate to the Red Army command was an insignificant price to pay in return for a chance to stave off Japan.\n\nAfter Kuular's death, Buyan-Badyrgy became the new head of the Tuvan government under the People's Revolutionary Council. And when Red Army forces capitulated to the Black Army invading from the north, he was allowed to walk free due to his popularity with the Tuvan people. For a time Buyan-Badyrgy remained content with this; little had changed other than the banner of the army protecting them. Yet once again chaos erupted in the war-torn region as various communes in the north of the Free Territory declared their secession, and had led to the arrival of Ivan Stepanov's forces.\n\nNow a new army had arrived in Tuva, for much the same reasons as the last. This army, however, they had no desire for cooperation with the Tuvan people; they organized conscription, diverted production and set up defences, dragging Tuva into more needless conflict. Buyan-Badyrgy could not stand idly by through this, and so, rallying former members of the Tuvan army and government, alongside Altaic partisans, he led a revolt against the Black Army's rule. Once more Tuva must fight against overwhelming forces, yet having overcome such odds before, Buyan-Badyrgy knows Tuva will prevail again."
 POLITICS_REGIONAL_COUNCILS_DESC: "Anarchy - the ideal that had liberated Central Siberia from the shackles of authoritarianism, warlordism and elitism, has fallen. When the communes of Krasnoyarsk declared their independence and returned to the darkness that had consumed the region months prior, the communes of northern Siberia found themselves cut off from the General Assembly's guidance. Panic rose as the loss of an agreed-upon inter-communal body left them divided and undirected.\n\nYet days passed, which became weeks and then months, and the communes of north Siberia remained. The fear of invasion from the new warlords to the south did not come to fruition, the prospect of a famine arising from a lack of coordination between communes, too, never came to pass. Although undoubtedly facing hardships, the decentralised communes of the North Siberian Soviets have survived, now separate from all authority.\n\nWhile this extreme decentralisation makes the fielding of an army, coordination in development and any form of decisive action near impossible, the communes of Norilsk, Kolpashevo and their many rural comrades persist. The General Assembly, previously seen as vital to the coordination of the Free Territory, is now seen as an obsolete organization, one which impeded the people of Siberia from realising true anarchism.\n\nThough in the harsh lands of Russia, with warlords to the south and centralized states forming to the east and west, can such a system truly survive?"
 POLITICS_IVAN_STEPANOV_DESC: "If there were to be one upside to the collapse of the Soviet Union, it would undoubtedly be the wide assortment of characters, heroes and villains alike, with wildly different motivations, dreams, and goals able to reforge the nation in their own vision. What warlord could claim to be as visionary as the Free Territory? The struggle for anarchism didn't always have to be a dream. There exists a world where Siuda and his faction are triumphant, a world where anarchism is finally allowed a chance to prove itself, a world where all people may one day be free, a world without Ivan Georgievich Stepanov.\n\nWhat sets Stepanov apart from Leninist mutineers and Rurikids monarchs is not that he is without vision or purpose, in that regard he isn't much different from Siuda himself. One could easily claim that Stepanov's vision is grander than Siuda's or any other warlord scattered across shattered Russia. Slowly building a hidden hierarchy in the Free Territory that revolves entirely around him, Stepanov pioneered the Security Council, a body able to override the General Assembly in the name of territorial integrity. At the time, the Security Council was an absolute necessity, forcing even the most passionate ideologues to begrudgingly accept the body's role in the Free Territory. However, as the Free Territory subsumed more and more, people began to question why the council was still necessary.\n\nWell? Why was it? To the safety of the Free Territory, it was no longer necessary. To finalize Stepanov's goals, the Security Council was everything, the only way for him to exercise control. And, for Ivan Stepanov, that's what it's always been about; control. For the longest time, Stepanov has been willing to bide his time, to wait until he was the focal point in which the Free Territory revolves around. But he's waited for more than two decades now, putting up with the nonsensical whims of people whose ideology he doesn't understand and doesn't care to. Many opportunities have presented themselves to Stepanov and he's let them slip right through his fingers. Now, in the chaos of anarchy, Stepanov will grab that opportunity tight, strangle it, and never let go."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_ASTAFYEV: "Krasnoyarsk was a state founded on promises. Promises of freedom, promises of greatness, promises of prosperity for decades to come. Where are all those promises now?\n\nComrade Siuda made many promises upon the Black Army's entry into Krasnoyarsk as well. Promises of liberation, promises of emancipation, and promises of equality for all. For a time, in the days and weeks following the collapse of Andreev's fiefdom, these promises were made good upon. The Black Army expelled the city's oppressors while representatives of the General Assembly established a local assembly in conjunction with the Social Democratic Party. It was in the overcrowded, unkept, and musty cafeteria of the Siberian Technical Institute of Forest that Viktor Petrovich Astafyev first got a taste for anarchism. Those sent to aid in the reorganization of structure in the city did well at adjusting a moderate democrat such as Astafyev to the new lifestyle awaiting him and the other inhabitants of the city. Emerging as a communal leader, Astafyev met with Siuda and Taratuta on multiple occasions. Viktor's close association with Siuda and high-ranking members of the General Assembly made his betrayal all the worse.\n\nAstafyev pondered if this was truly anarchism as his city became home to the headquarters of the Black Army. Astafyev's requests for increased civilian governance fell on deaf ears as quotas were delivered from Kilchichakov, Mishurenko established a permanent residence in the city alongside his large following of soldiers, and Stepanov cast down veto after veto on local motions.\n\nSiuda truly is no different than Andreev, and Astafyev and the people of Russia are far past empty promises. Though Siuda and the General Assembly have made multiple requests for Krasynoarsk to return to the fold, Siuda is not free of sin. In the mind of Viktor Nekrasov, associating with tyrants makes one no better, and tyrants have no place in a free Russia."
 POLITICS_YURIY_KRYLOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Yuriy Nikolayevich Krylov is a man trapped in a storybook. At least, it's been easier for him to view his life as a story being told rather than a life being lived. The author of the tragedy has seen fit that Yuriy be a protagonist, a prince presiding over a troubled land.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a young boy. He was a noble, but lived as one amongst the citizens of the flourishing kingdom. One day, while the young boy read by the river, an evil wizard came to his kingdom, hexing all those around him to be slaves, unrelenting in service to their master. The wizard's tricks did not affect the royal family. The king and his guard fought gallantly to repel the wizard, but the wizard and his knight overwhelmed the kingdom, taking the king prisoner and leaving the hero's sister slain in battle.\n\nSpared by the forces of the wizard under the protection of his subjects, Yuriy assumed a new identity, renouncing his titles. Still, the hero worked tirelessly to enhance the lives of his people, subverting the wizard's puppet administration. For a time, it seemed as though the wizard's empire was invincible, until a rift opened up between the wizard and the knight. The knight began to assert himself as the hegemon of the region, using whatever means necessary to secure a kingdom of his own. The brutal methods of the knight and the waning influence of the wizard provided an opportunity to strike, as the prophecy had foretold.\n\nThe hero, having assumed the name and title of King Rurik III, rallied his most loyal supporters to break free of the wizard's brainwashing and to live in freedom once more. While the hero of prophecy recuperates his forces, the mad general of the south continues his raids. The story of King Rurik III is far from over. The battle of prophecy will soon commence and the people can finally live...\n\n§G...Happily ever after.§!"
 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "What place does a conservative businessman have in Russia? In the days of the empire, he would find his virgining enterprise quashed by the backwardness of the Tsar. In the days of the Union, he would find his owings confiscated at best and his life too at worst. Now, in the days of the Russian anarchy, more than ever, what place is there for a conservative businessman?\n\nDespite his grievances with Pokryshkin and the unapologetic kleptocrats of the federation, the fall of Novosibirsk and, more importantly to him, Barnaul, left Shukshin in a severe state of depression. The chaos and confusion of the days and weeks following the capitulation of the federation scattered many of Russia's best and brightest into the wind. Pokryshkin; missing and presumed dead. The chief officers of the mega corporations; executed or imprisoned. Vasily Makarovich Shukshin was all that remained of the capitalist establishment. Forced into a life of reclusion after his popularity with the citizenry spared him from punishment, Shukshin spent his days drinking in the solitude of his home. Truly, people reach their lowest points when excluded from the majority and under the tyranny of the General Assembly, the majority was never so powerful and Shukshin was never so weak..That was, until one day, Shukshin received a letter.\n\nA former high ranking member of the Barnaul city council expressed the raising discontent in the city. The letter was clear in goal, even if the language hid the fact, the cracks in the anarchist foundation had begun to show and the people yearned for the promise of the federation. Shukshin became a man rejuvenated, his optimism and sense of purpose restored. The schism in the anarchist movement proves only one thing, anarchism doesn't work. Unlike the splintered anarchist movement, Shukshin has a job to do, and he'll be damned if the anarchists get the better of him twice."
 POLITICS_VITALY_KOSTIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Can one person change the world? Sure. A Romanov, a businessman, a scholar, people of class, all can bend the world to their whims. But can a slave? Can a simple worker take the reins of oppression and break them without a Lenin? Vitaly Semyonovich Kostin doesn't really know, and, in all honesty, he hoped he would never have to find out.\n\nNothing more than a construction engineer in Novosibirsk, Kostin quickly became one of the most ardent supporters of the Free Territory and their liberationist message. Present at the liberation of the city, Kostin proved an effective organizer and orator, with his simple populist message resonating with his fellow workers. The strike fostered by Kostin proved instrumental in the Free Territory's campaign against the Siberian Falcon. Following the establishment of an assembly in Novosibirsk, Kostin, a man of humble origins, sought to return to his modest life of work, content to leave the fate of Russia to the capable hands of Comrade Siuda. But it was not Siuda who laid claim to the city first.\n\nIn the weeks following the campaign, one name became more common than that of Pokryshkin; Ivan Stepanov. They began as whispers, rumors of a powerful lackey to Siuda who formed the muscle of their duo. Word spread quickly, but it was the seemingly unendingly increasing number of Black Army soldiers present at factories and demonstrations that made it clear something was amiss. Strict quotas, political repression, and rampant corruption left many residents of the city scratching their heads, wondering what changed. The blatant repression of the working people became so severe it forced one man out of retirement.\n\nBetrayed by the capitalists of Novosibirsk and once more by the anarchists of Kansk, Kostin embodies the heart and soul of the Russian people; tired. How many revolts must occur? How many times must the people be lied to? Kostin doesn't know all the answers, he doesn't know much at all, but he does know that oppression in any form must be stamped out, no matter if it hides behind the skull and crossbones or not."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_NEKRASOV_DESC: "Disillusioned with the tyranny of Chairman Yagoda and at odds with the corporate capitalists of Novosibirsk, Viktor Platonovich Nekrasov found himself most closely aligned with Shostakovich and the Humanist Salon in Tomsk. Despite this, Nekrasov could never find his footing with the more radical social democrats and moderate socialists. Nekrasov felt lost. His ideology was much to the left of prominent humanists yet still to the right of the anarchist movement cultivating to the south. Without a movement to call home, Nekrasov resigned himself to a life of writing, a passion he had picked up after settling in the intellectual heart of Russia. Nekrasov took an interest in journalism. His lack of ideological alignment may have left him isolated but granted him an exceptional career as a war correspondent, covering the movements of warlords across Central Siberia and to the east. It was the Black Army that garnered the most attention from him.\n\nIf his attention was not captured by the expansion of the Free Territory, its leaders marching down the streets of Tomsk most certainly did. While his views didn't line up with Siudaist thought one to one, he had little complaints in the following the liberation of the city. The abolishment of the salon system offered him more say than previously, and the Territory's aversion to authoritarianism was certainly appreciated. As days and weeks went by, however, it seemed as though the conflict in Tomsk never ceased. Anarchist splinter groups loyal to different factions and philosophies battled openly in the streets prompting larger quantities of Black Army detachments to police the city.\n\nAs the conflict swelled, Nekrasov felt a divide grow in him as well. If history were to continue, if scholars and scribes could still find work in a cutthroat era of utilitarianism, the march on Tomsk would go down as the most significant workers strike of a generation and Viktor Nekrasov wouldn't be where he was. However, fate is often unkind, and those with the best intentions often find themselves on the wrong side of history."

 SBA_intro_present_elected_officer_candidates_desc: "もう一つ、我々シベリア黒衛軍には誇るべき伝統がある。それはかつてのマフノフチシナと同様に、全ての将校を兵士たちの民主的な選挙によって選ぶということだ。伝統に盲従する専制的な指揮系統とは違う。我々の将校は、人民が自らを守るために選ぶ存在なのだ。将校は兵士委員会によって選出され、兵士委員会によって解任される。この制度を完成させるのには、数年を要した。そしてこの制度によって、我々は真に有能な将校を兵士たち自身の手で選ぶことが可能となったのだ。\n\nカンスクでの第三次総会において、まず行うべきことは議員たちの前で軍とその兵士たちの現状を示すことだ。将校たちがそれらの状況を説明することで、初めて各種問題についての議論を進めることができる。"
 SBA_intro_present_revolutionary_security_reports_desc: "黒衛軍はこの解放区の防衛システムの根幹である。彼らがいなければ、我々は今もヤゴーダ政権や中部シベリアの「民主的な」国家の鎖に繋がれていたことだろう。だが、全軍の任務と行動を一致させ、統一行動をとるのは極めて困難な問題である。だからそれを実現するために、「防衛報告書」が必要となる。この資料は各地の現状を確認し、協力してコミューンの防衛を行うために大いに役立つことだろう。第三次総会でもそれは同じだ。それは中部シベリア全体の現状を確認するのに必要となる。この混沌としたロシアで生き抜くためには、団結が最も重要なのだから。"
 SBA_intro_present_local_developmental_reports_desc: "カンスク評議会に出席している各地の代表たちに対しこのコミューンの成功を示すためには、各地における我々の事業と自治の成果が発表されねばならない。疑うまでもないことだが、全ての街や村の人々はアナーキズムの原則に基づき、国家権力によるものでない支援によって、自由に故郷を発展させることが可能となっている。だから、総会において各地における発展の現状を示すことで、アナーキズムの有効性はより保守的な人々にとっても批判の余地のないものとなるだろう。"
 SBA_intro_riding_on_desc: "混沌と専制主義の中で生まれた黒衛軍は、安定と真の自由の擁護者であり続けねばならない。既に我々の隣人は、典型的な我々がなるべきでない存在へとなり果てている。我々はそうなってはならない。民衆の意思と決意によって、中部シベリアにおける諸問題を解決していかねばならない。そして隣人たちを打ち破るために、我々はできる限りのことをせねばならない。"

 SBA_second_the_red_mantle_desc: "シベリア計画とは、独ソ戦に備えて行われた東方への産業移転計画だ。我々は戦争には負けたが、計画に基づいて行われた工業化によって、ソ連邦は誰も予想しなかったほど急速な工業化を成し遂げた。皮肉なことに、シベリアはその計画の焦点ではなかったため、我々の住む地域の工業化はそれほど進んではいない。だがそれでも、残された工業施設は発展のための確かな基盤となることだろう。"
 SBA_second_the_peoples_survey_desc: "コミューン内で資源の効率的に利用するには、工業化、資源開発、そして農業それぞれに適した地域を把握しておくことが重要だ。加えて軍閥の支配領域の境界線は不確定で頻繁に変化する。だから土地の調査を行うことが必要だ。調査を行うことによって、どこからどこまでが我々の支配領域なのかといったことや、戦争の際にどの地域が重要で、どの地域を守るべきなのかといったことを正確に把握することができる。そしてこの調査のためには、各地の人々によって「人民調査委員会」を結成することが必要だ。この委員会は、コミューン間で互いの土地の調査を共同で行うために結成される。"
 SBA_second_industrial_data_consolidation_desc: "自由地区では極度に分権化された政治体制ゆえに、各コミューンが使用できる工業機械の質と量は、しばしばコミューン自身の生産能力によって決定されている。この結果、コミューン間で著しい生産能力の格差が生じ、必要なだけの生産を実現できないコミューンが時折生まれてしまっていた。各コミューンの生産能力についてのデータを総合することによって、どのコミューンに優先的に投資すべきか把握することができるだろう。"
 SBA_second_begin_the_redistribution_desc: "土地改革は数年前、シベリア・ソビエトが結成された当初から着手していた改革だが、それは未だに完了できていない。なぜなら、結成当初の我々は何よりも存続することに全力を傾けねばならず、それ故に土地改革を行う余裕がなかったのだ。だが存続するという最大の問題が一応解決されたことで、ようやく我々はこの改革を再開することが可能となった。土地改革のための最大の障害は、各コミューンの利害対立だ。着手した当時、どのコミューンもより多くの土地を獲得するために、資源を浪費していた。この問題を解決するためには、より公平な方法による境界策定が必要となるだろう。"
 SBA_second_repair_the_transsib_desc: "ツァーリズムが残した数少ない成功の一つが、シベリア鉄道である。この鉄道の完成は、全ロシアに極めて大きな影響を与えた。かつてないほどに、ロシア全域が接続されたのだ。この鉄道はブハーリン政権時代に特に多く使われ、1950年代の独ソ戦においてはソ連の生命線であった。そのため敗戦ののち、鉄道はルフトヴァッフェによって徹底的に破壊された。だが、ロシアの空から彼らが消え去った今、この鉄道を修復し、かつての栄光を取り戻させることができるかもしれない。"
 SBA_second_continue_regional_interconnection_desc: "インフラの整備は常に欠かしてはならない。インフラ整備を行うことは、資源の流れを円滑化するだけでなく、各コミューンの距離を縮めることにも繋がる。それは経済的だけでなく政治的にも有効なことである。そして、シベリア・ソビエトが拡大するにつれて、インフラ整備はますます重要となるだろう。我々は道路の建設に更なる投資を行い、孤立したコミューンを作らないようにしなくてはならないのだ。"
 SBA_second_return_to_the_mines_desc: "経済が平時の水準まで回復し、復興のための公共事業が行われたことによって、我々の経済は急速に発展している。だがそれ故に鉱物資源の需要はおよそ10倍となり、多くのコミューンにおいて資源不足が生じている。ルフトヴァッフェにより鉱山が破壊される危険がなくなった今こそ、閉鎖していた鉱山の操業を再開するよい機会だろう。そして操業再開にあたって、鉱山へのアクセスが容易なコミューンに対し、新たな採掘機械を供給することも必要となるだろう。"
 SBA_second_dedicated_agricultural_production_desc: "我々のコミューンはどんどん拡大し続けている。コミューンによって日々食料が供給されることにより、出生率は大きく向上した。だがこれを継続するためには、農業生産の更なる拡大が必要不可欠だ。そしてそのために、農業機械の更なる生産と供給を行わなくてはならない。このことは農民たちを助けるだけでなく、労働者たちがより良い働きをすることにも繋がることだろう。"
 SBA_second_rural_production_nodes_desc: "アナーキストの社会の中心は都市やその郊外ではなく、地方の地域社会にある。こうした地域の生産という分野における都市への依存を終わらせることは、我々にとって重要な目標だ。そのためには、地方のコミューンにおける生産拠点を整備することが必要だ。さらにこのことは、各コミューンがライフルを自分たちで生産することを可能とし、黒衛軍全体の武装にも役立つことだろう。"
 SBA_second_the_foundation_laid_desc: "誰もが実現不可能と考えていたアナーキズムという政治理論は、実際には優れた理論であるということを幾度となく証明してきた。ついに我々は倫理観にも抵触することなく、一部の特権階級だけが得をすることもない、全ロシアの人々が利益を得ることができる経済制度を完成させたのだ。"
 SBA_second_the_grey_area_desc: "世界が完璧なものであるならば、そこには自然とアナーキズム社会が生まれてくるだろう。そうした世界においては、腐敗し、富裕層を優遇する不公正な国家に対して人々は間違いなく反旗を翻す。だが実際に我々が住む世界では、人々はもっと自分の国に愛着を持っている。そして多くの国々は我々を脅威とみなしているのだ。コミューンは、そういった国々からの攻撃に対し独力では対応できない。だから革命の防衛には、中央集権的な軍隊が必要なのだ！「おいおい、中央集権的なアナーキストの軍隊だって？お前は何を言ってるんだ？」「そもそも、全コミューンを指導する中央評議会なんてものは、アナーキズムの理念に反しているんじゃないのか？」「お前たちはアナーキズムの根幹部分を忘れてないか？」もっともな指摘である。こうした議論は重要だ。こういった活発な議論によって、コミューンと個人の権利という問題を解決せねばならないのだ。"
 SBA_second_delegate_industrial_administration_desc: "そもそも共産主義とは、生産手段を人民のもとに取り返すことを目的としたイデオロギーだ。中央集権的な政府による統制経済は、この考え方に完全に違反している。我々はそういった手段によらずに効率的な経済を構築していかねばならないのだ。そしてそのために、我々はいくつかのコミューンで構成される産業委員会を設置することにした。彼らにはある程度の予算が割り当てられ、その予算は経済の効率化だけでなく、発展の遅れているコミューンの支援にも回されることだろう。"
 SBA_second_the_industrial_security_council_desc: "効率的な経済を構築するという困難な課題の解決には、中央集権的な国家機構が必要となる。なぜなら、どのコミューンも自力では防衛を行えないのと同じように、産業の発展も自力では行えないのだ。我々の発展のためには、黒衛軍が保有する武力を背景に、産業についての情報を収集、分析する機関を構築するべきだろう。彼らにそういった事業を一任することによって初めて、工業化が可能となるのだ。"
 SBA_second_roads_for_grain_desc: "コミューン間での商業の発展には、農作物運搬用の道路の建設がますます重要となるだろう。そして穀物バンクを設置し、余剰農作物をその道路を利用し各コミューン間で分配することによって、コミューンはさらに発展することができる。穀物バンクに貯蔵される食料は、余剰農作物の生まれたコミューンによって自発的に供給される。そしてそこに供給した食料の量に応じて、それに見合った資金や資源、産業機械などをコミューンは受け取ることができる。"
 SBA_second_collective_defense_requirements_desc: "安全保障のためには、インフラの整備は急務だ。軍を配置していない地域が奇襲を受けたときや、二正面作戦を強いられた場合に、インフラが整備されていれば迅速に、そして効率的に対応することができる。そのために特別税を徴収し、直ちに建設を開始しなくてはならない。この税は各コミューンに混乱をもたらすかもしれないが、これは必要な税なのだ。"
 SBA_second_incentivize_qualified_personnel_desc: "我々シベリア・ソビエトにおいては、電気工学、機械工学といった重要分野の専門家の不足が深刻なものとなっている。この問題は、主にソ連邦崩壊後のロシアにおいて集団的な教育が行われていないことに起因している。この問題の一番の解決策は、こういった分野に就職する人を増やすことだ。労働者たちが相互に専門技術を教え合うことによって、この分野の専門家を増やすことができるだろう。"
 SBA_second_black_army_engineer_brigades_desc: "専門的な技師の不足は、革命の防衛という目的のためにも大きな問題となっている。この問題の解決には、黒衛軍の訓練システムが大いに役立つことだろう。才能のある者を徴兵し、軍隊内でそうした技術を学ばせるのだ。故郷に帰還した彼らは軍隊内で培った技術を生かし、コミューンの発展のために尽力してくれるだろう。これは誰にとってもメリットのある手法なのだ！"
 SBA_second_assist_village_schools_desc: "教育は、我々のコミューンを原始時代から現代へと進歩させる一番の方法である。より良い教育機関を構築するためには、各コミューンへの支援を強化することが必要だ。このことの一環として、優秀な教師を各地に派遣し、教師の養成を行う予定だ。そして、学校に進学する人の数を増やすことで、これらの支援の効果をさらに大きくすることができる。"
 SBA_second_expand_the_umbrella_desc: "学校と教育は安全保障のための重要な要素だ。人民が反動主義や反革命のイデオロギーに触れることを許してはならない。彼らがそういった思想に触れることを防ぐためには、教育制度を軍の管理下に置くと良いだろう。それにそもそも、中央集権的な教育制度それ自体が、効率的な教育という利点を持っているのだ。"
 SBA_second_the_contradictions_settled_desc: "かつてのソ連邦と同様に、我々はどこまでが政府権力の及ぶ範囲で、どこまでが人民の権利なのか、という問題についてのある程度の結論に達した。我々のアナーキズムに生じていた矛盾は完全に解決され、さらにその過程でかつて問題になっていた行政上の課題も同様に解決された。たとえどのような道を我々が辿ったとしても、それはロシアの人民のより大きな幸福のために行ったことなのだ。後世の人々の我々への評価が正当なものとなりますように……"
 SBA_second_the_black_army_desc: "黒衛軍はこの地における革命と自由の守護者であり、そして暴君や独裁者たちの手からシベリアを救うための軍隊でもある。だがシベリアでの戦争の影響は大きく、我々の軍は疲弊している。装備と人員という面でさえ、周辺の勢力と同等の力を取り戻すには長い時間を要するだろう。速やかに軍隊の再建を成し遂げるためには、現状を把握し、改善すべき点を確認しておくことが有効だ。"
 SBA_second_review_the_chain_of_command_desc: "軍隊内民主主義に基づき、我々の将校は顔の見えない最高司令部ではなく人民自身によって選出されている。このシステムは過去数年にわたって民主化の一環として行われてきたが、その弊害として無能が将校になる事態を招いてしまった。だが実際のところそれは問題にはならない。なぜなら、無能な将校は人民の手で直ちに罷免されるのだ。我々はそうした無能が将校になっていないか調べるために、将校に対して試験を実施する必要がある。"
 SBA_second_learning_from_experience_desc: "黒衛軍には全ロシアで最良の将軍たちが所属している。ロシア内戦から近年のシベリア戦争に至るまで、彼らは長い経験を積んできた。彼らの経験は、新たな士官を養成する際に大いに役立つことだろう。彼らと協力してドクトリンの統一を行い、そして士官の養成プログラムを完成させるのだ。"
 SBA_second_specialized_unit_roles_desc: "この数年間の経験から、他勢力と渡り合うためには黒衛軍の更なる専門化が必要だということが明らかになった。これからは装甲部隊や航空戦力を有する近代的な軍隊との戦いが想定される以上、各部隊の役割分担の重要性はますます増している。そしてそのためには、追加の軍事予算を設定し、装備調達、軍事工学、偵察、敵地潜入といった専門的な部隊の創設を行わなくてはならない。"
 SBA_second_black_guards_divisions_desc: "ロシア内戦の時代、戦場にはタチャンカと呼ばれる機関銃付きの馬車に乗り込み、敵地に突入していった勇敢な兵士たちがいた。我々にも彼らのような強く勇敢な部隊が必要だ。そのために、我々は新たに精鋭部隊を創設することにした。黒衛軍で最も優秀な兵士たちから成る部隊である。軍隊内でテストを行い、その部隊に所属するのに相応しい者を選出するのだ。彼らは将来的には、必要な時に直ちに展開し、全土における防御と攻撃を主導することになるだろう。"
 SBA_second_enhanced_equipment_channels_desc: "現在の装備の供給体制は、非効率的であるだけでなく、拡大することも困難な構造になっている。そこで装備生産を担当する部署から、いくつかの改革案が出されている。そもそも、装備の低い信頼性、在庫管理の失敗といった種々の問題の原因は、いずれも現場とのコミュニケーション不足にあった。改革案とは、軍需工場と補給基地との間に電話回線を設置することでこの問題の解決を図る、といったものだ。これが上手くいけば、供給体制の改善に繋がることだろう。"
 SBA_second_the_new_tachanka_desc: "我々の保有する装甲部隊の戦力は、ロシアの統一を目指す他の勢力に比べ大きく遅れを取っている。この状況を変えるべく、我々はシベリア戦争期に鹵獲したドイツ、アメリカ、日本といった先進諸国の戦車のリバースエンジニアリングを行ってきた。そこから得られた技術と、前大戦で活躍したT-34、T-44といった戦車の開発時の経験を活かし、我々は新たにオリジナルの戦車を設計することが可能となった。"
 SBA_second_expand_on_the_design_desc: "技術発展と設計インフラの整備により、我々はようやく新型MBTの開発に着手できるようになった。この新型戦車には、電動スターター、2台の砲安定装置、暗視装置、4ストローク1室水冷式ディーゼルエンジン、45発装填といった様々な新技術が取り入れられている。これら新技術はいずれも信頼性に欠ける部分があるが、それでもこれはロシアの戦車開発の飛躍的な進歩の象徴といえるだろう。この技術が、我々の装甲部隊の礎を成すことは疑いない。"
 SBA_second_coverage_from_above_desc: "各地から集結した数十人の技術者たちによって、撃墜したドイツの爆撃機や、その他諸国の戦闘機のリバースエンジニアリングが行われた。ここから得られた技術により、我々は近隣の諸勢力と同等の航空技術を手に入れるどころか、将来的にはジェット機の開発さえ可能となるだろう。"
 SBA_second_our_blade_honed_desc: "シベリア戦争により、我々は極度に疲弊していた。我々は外部の支援も産業もない中で激しい戦いを何年も続けていた。誰もが我々の実験が失敗に終わると考えていた。彼らは間違っていた。その後の数年間で、我々は軍の再建を成し遂げ、そしてその過程で我々はさらに強くなった。大規模な産業という強固な基盤を有し、人口も大きく増加している。我々の刃は研ぎ澄まされ、そして鍛え上げられている。さあ、反撃の狼煙を上げろ。革命の防衛には、攻撃あるのみだ！"

 SBA_regional_consolidate_the_regional_courts_desc: "新領土はコミューンに再編されねばならない。一見、彼ら自身にコミューンを組織させればいいように思われるが、実際にはそう上手くはいかない。コミューンへの組織化を巡って、我々の間でイデオロギー的激論が起こった。そもそも、中部シベリアの住人たちはこれまで一度たりともアナーキストの社会で暮らしたことがないのに、どうして自分自身でコミューンを組織できるというのか？あまりにも多くの人々が理想に固執し、実態を見ていない。では、どうすればよいのだろうか？彼らが言うように自主的に組織化を行わせるのがよいのだろうか？それとも、コミューンへ組織化が実現するまで、黒衛軍に軍政を行わせるべきなのだろうか？"
 SBA_regional_instate_provisional_leadership_desc: "我々は真実を知っている。新領土に住む多くの人々は、アナーキズムに反対している。もしも彼らに自力での組織化を求めれば、彼らのサボタージュを引き起こすだろう。問題解決のためには、たとえそれがアナーキズムの理想に反するものであるとしても、一時的に黒衛軍による軍政を行うしかない。これは革命のため、必要なことなのだ。上手くいけば、人々はより早くアナーキズム社会に適応し、黒衛軍の権威が確立される前に自立できるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_faith_in_the_newly_integrated_desc: "黒衛軍に軍政を敷かせるなど、言語道断だ！たとえこの路線が非現実的だとしても、軍政という悪い前例を作るわけにはいかない。もしわれわれがさらに拡大した時も、彼らに支配を任せるというのか？そのようなことをすれば、我々が民衆を信頼していないことを示し、アナーキズムの定着に悪影響を及ぼすのは間違いない。そもそも、アナーキズムは民衆への信頼に立脚しているのだ。たとえどんなに非協力的な人々であっても、彼らを信頼しなくてはアナーキストの社会は実現できない。軍隊を用いれば、我々はファシストと何も変わらなくなってしまう。"
 SBA_regional_strike_the_balance_of_power_desc: "黒衛軍は強大な勢力であり、我々は幾度となく彼らに頼らざるを得なかった。だが、彼らにこれ以上依存すれば、軍事政権の樹立を許してしまうだろう。黒衛軍による支配という最悪の事態を防ぐには、ソビエトとコミューンを強化せねばならない。評議会の権限を拡大し、黒衛軍の任務を他の組織に移譲することで、最悪の状況にあってもアナーキズムの理想を維持できるだろう。"

 SBA_regional_correct_the_misguided_teachings_desc: "教育とは我々の未来そのものだ。若者に価値観を植え付けるのは教育だ。人々の人生を作るのも教育だ。かつてのソ連邦や中央シベリア共和国でもある程度適切な教育は行われていたが、人民を完全なアナーキストにするにはそれだけでは不十分だ。他にも多くの面で教育改革を行わなくてはならない。特に重要なことは、かつての中央シベリア諸国の失敗を示すことだ。偽の民主主義者と国家主義者たちを弾劾し、アナーキストたちの成功を人民に示すのだ。長い時間を要するだろうが、それによって人民はアナーキズムの正しさに目覚めるだろう！"
 SBA_regional_cast_down_social_injustice_desc: "何世紀もかけ、ロシアの諸国家は不平等な文化を作り上げてきた。女性は多くの場合男性に劣る存在とみなされ、専業主婦にされてきた。非ロシア民族も同様だ。偏見に基づき、同様の扱いを受けてきた。だが、最悪なのは同性愛者に対する扱いだ。彼らは、もはや人間扱いすらされなかった。アナーキストの社会において、そのような偏見は存在してはならない。我々は女性を鎖から解き放つため戦う。異民族は、ただ見た目が少し違う同じ人間だ。そして同性愛者の同志たちは、愛する人を自由に愛すことができなくてはならない！"

 SBA_regional_establish_the_provisional_resource_council_desc: "新たな領土と資源を獲得したことで、コミューンを適切に機能させるためにはその資源を適切に運用することが必要になった。この目的を果たすためには、臨時資源委員会の結成が必要だ。この委員会は資源採掘関連の労働者たちと資源を必要とする地域の代表者で構成され、主に自由地区内部における資源の採掘、分配を行う。彼らは、各地域が必要とする資源を十分に提供できるであろうし、さらに彼らの存在は労働者たちの意見を政策に取り入れることに繋がるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_the_last_congress_of_kansk_desc: "自由地区の急速な拡大に伴い、コミューンの適切な運用のためにはより中心的な場所が必要となった。ノヴォシビルスクへの移転は、民主的な選挙によって行われる必要がある。だが、まだ残された問題がある。その解決のため、カンスクで最後の評議会を開かねばならない。ノヴォシビルスクへの移転前に、全ての問題を解決するのだ！"
 SBA_regional_rectify_the_rural_urban_split_desc: "最初の議題は、都市と農村の分断である。農村における同志の多くは、自分たちの村を適切にコミューン化することができたが、都市部においてはこのプロセスが上手くいっていない。都市は人口が多く、それ故により多くの資源や支援を行わねばならない。各地でコミューン内部の統合が完了したことで、ようやく我々はこの問題に注力することが可能となった。新たなコミューンを設置することで、のちのモデルケースとするのだ。自由地区内部の全ての人々を真に解放するため、全力を尽くさねばならない！"
 SBA_regional_honors_for_humanity_desc: "ソ連邦の崩壊、そして中央シベリア共和国の分裂以降、人々は無法地帯の中に取り残されてしまった。そしてその中で、多くの人々が宗教に傾倒し、各地で宗教の影響力が増していった。我々は宗教を禁止すべきとは言わないが、その影響力を削ぐ必要はある。民衆に対し世俗主義的な教育を行い、コミューンという希望を与え、そして我々の目標のため教会の財産を利用するのだ。たとえ反対者がいようとも、これは必要なことなのだ！"

 SBA_regional_liberty_all_encompassing_and_eternal_desc: "全ての問題が解決され、最後の評議会は閉会した。主要な問題が解決されたことで、新たなコミューンの設立は順調に進んでいる。最後に行うことは、ノヴォシビルスクへの移転を巡る投票だ。あらゆる困難の中で、自由地区は拡大しただけでなく、我々は大いに繁栄し、中部シベリア全域にアナーキズムを広めることができた。我々はウクライナで戦った。カタロニアでも戦った。そしてついに、我々は中部シベリアの地で成功したのだ！人民に自由がもたらされ、我々の新たな夜明けが近づいている。自由の果実を味わえる、新たな夜明けだ！"
 SBA_regional_develop_the_free_territory_desc: "中部シベリアは、かつてのソ連邦においては重要な地域ではなかった。シベリア鉄道の拡張や主要都市における各種機械の改良といった支援は受けていたが、この地に注力する資源や時間がソ連邦にはなかった。だがそれは彼らが我々を無視していたことを意味しない。シベリア計画にはインフラ整備や都市の拡張、軍需産業の統合、鉄資源の採掘、あるいはカラシニコフの製造販売まで、様々なことが含まれていた。当時実現不可能だったこれらの計画を、今実現するのだ。"
 SBA_regional_integrate_the_urban_economies_desc: "無政府社会において、都市はコミューン化が困難だった。食料を自給自足化できないため、付近で食料と武器を交換することが多々あった。だが現在では武器の生産も各地で可能になったため、この経済的な近郊すら崩れつつある。都市の失われた優位性を取り戻すためには、都市だけが持つ資源を活用せねばならない。すなわち多くの技術者と、大量のマンパワーだ。より専門的な製品と民生品を生産することで、都市は食料と交換するための物資を確保することができる。"
 SBA_regional_rebuild_urban_infrastructure_desc: "ドイツの攻撃を受けなかった中央シベリアも、西ロシアの惨状ほどではないにせよ、大きな被害を受けた。ドイツの爆撃機は飛んでこないものの、中央シベリア共和国の崩壊とそれに続く戦争により、都市部のインフラは早急に復旧しなくてはならない状況にある。この地での戦争が終結した今、現地のコミューンの協力により、復旧作業は容易となるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_re_organize_the_industrial_centers_desc: "共産主義の中心にあるのは、何よりも共同体だ。そしてその中では誰もが共通の利益を得ることができる。こういった理想的な共同体は緊密に結びついている村、あるいは町においては容易に実現可能だが、大都市では実現困難だ。だから、我々はそういった大都市の市民の団結心と兄弟愛を育まなくてはならない。そういった緊密な共同体は工場、あるいは職場において真っ先に実現できる。そしてその実現のためには、これまでの社内の身分関係を解体し、労働者自主管理体制を確立しなくてはならない。"
 SBA_regional_establish_the_council_of_trade_unions_desc: "黒衛軍が勝利する以前から、この地域には多くの労働組合が存在していた。しかし中には改革が必要な組織もある。コスティンスティはその好例だ。ボリシェヴィキの影響を強く受けた彼らは、この地で大きな影響力を有している。また、その他の労働組合も弱体で、シベリア全域の労働者を守るには不十分だ。評議会と安全保障委員会はこの状況を鑑み、全ての労働組合を合流させる決定を下した。これにより、労働者の隊列から、圧政者の第五列を排除することができるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_encourage_the_kostinsty_desc: "コスティンスティとは過激な労働者たちの組織で、自由地区の成立以前から存在していた。彼らの組織は我々の無政府主義とは異なり、戦前のブハーリン体制に近い構造である。だが、彼らの経験と影響力は我々にとって極めて有用だ。そして彼らも我々に対し援助を申し出ている。このような申し出を断ることは、愚か者にしかできないだろう。"
 SBA_regional_the_bounty_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "シベリア計画はその目標をほぼ達成した。既に何千台もの工業機械がシベリア中に分配され、試験運用が開始されている。蛍光灯が各地を照らし、数千の新たな炭鉱が開かれている。シベリアの生活水準は飛躍的に向上し、ロシアでも随一の工業地帯に変貌を遂げた。いずれ、我々はドイツをも凌駕することができるだろう……"
 SBA_regional_encourage_the_peasant_communes_desc: "本質的には、共産主義とは個人より共同体を重視する思想だ。だが、土地全体より大きな共同体があるというのだろうか？農村コミューンを支援しよう。かつての政府によって放置されていた農民大衆を、経済、政治の場に参加できるようにしよう。個々のコミューンの生産性は低くても、自由地区内部の全ての村々が協力すれば、巨大な繁栄をもたらすことができるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_develop_the_altai_region_desc: "アルタイ地域は工業化にとても向いた地域である。インフラが弱体なため、資源は未だ手つかずのままで、そして資源採掘、工場の運営が可能なだけの豊富な人口を有している。工業化の最初の一歩である鉄道の敷設だけでも、数週間のうちに農業、鉱業生産量を飛躍的に向上させることができるだろう。そしてそうすれば、本格的な工業化への道も開かれるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_facilitate_rural_mechanization_desc: "コミューンでの生活における重要な要素の一つは、自給自足だ。たしかに、農村それ自体にはそれを行う力はない。農村には電気機械や自動車などを生産できるような熟練労働者はいないし、産業機械もない。だが、我々にはそれらを提供する力がある。農村地域で機械化を支援することによって農村での自給自足化を支援すれば、余剰産物を生み出し、農村では手に入らないものを買うことを可能にすることができる。また、これは言うまでもないことだが、農業生産の増大は人口増加にも役立つだろう。"
 SBA_regional_ensure_rural_interconnection_desc: "街道から遠く離れた村、人口が少ない地域、侵略を受けやすい地域……自由地区にはこうした開発に適さない地域が多く存在する。こうした地域の開発を行うには、まずはインフラを整備することが重要だ。道路を建設し、鉄道を引き、電話線や送電網を整備する。工業化を行うにはこれでは不十分だが、それでも住民たちの生活水準は改善されるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_enlightenment_for_all_desc: "群雄割拠のロシアでは軍閥たちが互いに争いを繰り広げているが、その間に列強は急速に技術開発を推し進めている。我々は未だに数十年前の機材を使い続けているというのに、彼らは宇宙開発やコンピューター技術の開発競争を繰り広げ、さらに農業、工業の生産力は数十倍にも達した。彼らの技術力に追いつくためには、まずは教育や研究を行う機関を整備するため、多額の投資を行わなくてはならない。十分な資金と自由な研究を行える場を整備することこそが、民衆の教育水準を引き上げる最も確実な方法だ。"
 SBA_regional_the_interventionist_approach_desc: "ロシアの周囲には、ボタン一つでロシアを滅ぼせるような国がいくつも存在する。彼らがそれを望めば、すぐにでも何千ものミサイルが発射され、ロシアは核の炎によって焼き尽くされることだろう。さらに核兵器を抜きにしても、彼らの戦力は圧倒的だ。最新の銃、ミサイルを備えた彼らにとって、ロシアの遅れた軍隊を破るなどなんの造作もないことだ。ロシアの技術水準は20年前にソ連邦が崩壊したころから大して変わっていない。それは現時点で我々がそうした兵器を製造できる技術も、熟練労働者も有していないことに起因している。兵器の専門家たちによる委員会を結成し、その指導の下で技術者、労働者を育成するシステムを構築するのだ。これは列強諸国との技術格差を埋めるのに大いに役立つことだろう。"
 SBA_regional_trust_in_the_educators_desc: "教育制度の問題においては、黒衛軍内部でも意見が分かれている。ある派閥が言うには、教育の面で周辺諸国に追いつくためには、軍の指導下で一定の教育を全市民に与えなくてはならないらしい。だがそれは大きな間違いだ。農村では農業機械の扱い、都市部では工業機械や電子機械工学といったように、必要な知識は地域ごとに異なる。各コミューンに独自にカリキュラムを設定させることで、必要な教育を与えることができるのだ。"
 SBA_regional_inspire_progressive_thought_desc: "自由地区の防衛には、教育カリキュラムの統一が必要不可欠だ。コミューンに任せていては、反動勢力の侵入を許すことにつながりかねない。そしてアナーキーにおける軍の役割とは、反動勢力を打倒することだ。統一カリキュラムを制定し、必要な教育を全市民に与えなくてはならない。"
 SBA_regional_the_right_to_well_being_desc: "かつてクロポトキンは言った。「労働の権利」や、「労働の成果の分配」などと宣言するだけでは、全くもって不十分だと。真に自由で平等な社会においては、誰一人取り残されることがあってはならない。現在のロシアにおいては、不平等は受け入れなくてはならない現実だと言う者がいるが、これは大間違いだ。それは、発展しつつあるロシアの民を収奪しようとする上層階級の欺瞞にすぎない。一個の生産物、一軒の建物、一キロワットの電力に至るまで、全ては人民が勝ち取った利益なのだ。全て分配されなくてはならない。共同富裕の夢はもはや夢ではない。"
 SBA_regional_provide_schools_for_all_desc: "教育には大きな力がある。19世紀の欧州における識字率の高まりは、社会主義運動の勃興をもたらした。教育によって、政治が上流階級の独占物ではなくなったのだ。それだけではない。教育は産業や技術の発展にも必要だ。現在の中央シベリアでは、都市部でさえ教育機関の質が低く、農村に至ってはそもそも学校がない地域さえ存在する。質の高い教育を全ての人民に与えるには、新たな学校を建設しなくてはならない。"
 SBA_regional_expand_research_cooperatives_desc: "ロシアは世界の発展から大きく取り残されている。アメリカでテレビが日常風景となっていった頃、ロシアではラジオさえも贅沢品だった。ジェット機を日本が開発した頃、ロシアでは戦前のプロペラ機を使っていた。ドイツが数千の核弾頭を製造している頃、ロシアには一発の核弾頭も存在していなかった。\n\nコミューンに研究機関を設立し、列強の技術水準に追いつかなくてはならない。マフノにとってのタチャンカのような技術革新が、このシベリアには必要なのだ。"
 SBA_regional_lessons_from_the_union_desc: "シベリア計画は我々が予想していた以上の成果を上げている。完遂前の現在でさえ、シベリア全体の産業生産性は200%以上も向上し、先月だけでも、シベリア全域での発電量は毎時3億キロワットまで上昇した。これはフーヴァー・ダムの1か月分の発電量に匹敵する。そしてこれらの成果全ては、安全保障委員会の手によって成し遂げられた。この巨大な成果を前にしては、安全保障委員会に対する反対派も沈黙を余儀なくされている。"
 SBA_regional_reach_for_the_dawn_desc: "計画経済は市民の権利を侵害し、長期的には経済に害となりかねない。ロシアを発展させ、共産主義の完全な勝利をもたらすには、そうした権威主義的な手法は改めるべきだ。実際、ブハーリンはそれをやった結果、失敗したではないか。真の繁栄を実現するには、社会と経済が本当に必要とするものを生産するために、労働組合に生産管理を任せるべきだ。これを資本主義の言い換えとして非難する者がいるが、それは大嘘だ。それこそが真の社会主義経済なのだ。"
 SBA_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution_desc: "自由地区の周囲には、常に危険が存在する。軍閥や盗賊か跋扈し、都市はしばしば襲撃の脅威に晒されている。こうした脅威から市民たちを守るには、黒衛軍を民兵主体の組織から、職業軍へと再編しなくてはならない。そのためには対戦車兵器をはじめとする強力な装備を生産し、軍の戦闘能力を強化する必要がある。また、軍規の引き締めも必要だ。なぜなら、彼らはもはや農民の志願兵ではなく、兵士だからだ。"
 SBA_regional_maintain_the_flawless_legacy_desc: "黒衛軍は人民による、人民のための軍隊だ。この原則を捨ててはならない。これを捨てしまっては、現在の社会構造を根本的に変えてしまうことにさえつながりかねない。特に、現在のように軍が体制と密接に結びついている中でトップダウン方式の指揮系統を導入すると、腐敗、ひいてはクーデターの危険がある。アナーキーを守るためには、たとえ欠点があるとしても、現在の民主的な軍組織を守らなくてはならないのだ。"
 SBA_regional_welcome_the_rehabilitated_desc: "黒衛軍は大きな勝利を収めたが、その代償は大きかった。度重なる戦争で人的資源は大きく消耗しており、もはやコミューンからの志願兵ばかりに頼ることはできない。人員補充のためには、諸軍閥の兵士を再雇用しなくてはならない。そうすれば、解放した地域の統合も円滑に進められるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_lessons_from_the_liberation_war_desc: "シベリアの解放は、人的資源にものを言わせた人海戦術では絶対に成し遂げられなかった。優秀な士官たちが効果的な戦略を立案したことで、ようやく成し遂げられたのだ。一連の戦役の記録は、今後のドクトリン立案に必ず役立つことだろう。かつてのソ連邦が戦前から発展させてきたドクトリンも、その発展の土台には必要だ。すでに士官学校では、一連の戦役の記録をもとに、戦略に関する教育を開始している。"
 SBA_regional_industrial_warfare_desc: "数十年前に行われた大戦は、膨大な死者に加えて、大きな物的損害をももたらした。それは全ての交戦国にとって大きな教訓となったことだろう。将来的には様々な兵器の発展により、戦争には強力な産業が必要となることは間違いない。すでにその一端は先の解放戦争で示された。労働者たちが大量の物資を生産していなければ、決して勝利することはできなかっただろう。自由地区が拡大すれば、守らなくてはならない領域はさらに増える。その時に備えて、産業をさらに強化しなくてはならない。"
 SBA_regional_reinforce_the_soldiers_desc: "解放戦争が進展するにつれ、黒衛軍はさらに多くの人的資源を必要とするようになった。だが、もはや人員を確保するには、解放した地域からの徴兵が必要となりつつある。志願兵は常に少数で、増え続ける定員を満たすには全く足りないからだ。もちろん、それは当然だ。征服者の軍隊に好き好んで志願する者は滅多にいない。たとえそれが、自分たちに高度な自由を与えてくれるとしてもだ。新たに設立されたコミューンにおいても動員を進め、さらに彼らに対する宣伝を強化していかなくてはならない。"
 SBA_regional_following_the_falcon_desc: "ノヴォシビルスク攻略は困難な事業であった。陸軍は決して強力ではなかったものの、空軍の攻撃によって我々は無視できない被害を被った。だが、現在ではノヴォシビルスクも、ロシア最大ともいわれた、かの街の航空機産業も我々の手中にある。優秀な技術者も揃っており、黒衛軍の近代化は大きく前進することだろう。"
 SBA_regional_black_wings_above_desc: "黒衛軍には空軍を運用した経験がほとんどない。航空機を用いたことはあるものの、空軍の運用に必要な産業も、パイロットも十分ではないのだ。だが、敵は我々より強大だ。彼らに対抗するためには、黒衛軍にも空軍部隊を創設しなくてはならない。退役したパイロットに教育を行わせると同時に、航空機の近代化も進める必要がある。そして、航空機生産に必要な産業基盤も強化しなくてはならない。"
 SBA_regional_experimental_helicopter_designs_desc: "ヘリコプターはロシアが崩壊に苦しむ最中に発生した技術革新の一つだ。この奇妙な飛行機はこれまでの航空機と異なり、水平のプロペラを用いることにより垂直離着陸を可能としている。運用方法も、対地攻撃、物資、兵員の輸送など多岐に渡り、さまざまな可能性を秘めている。近年の南アフリカ戦争でもこの兵器の有用性は示されており、すでに自由地区でも開発が開始されている。"
 SBA_regional_past_the_tachanka_desc: "軍隊の機械化、自動車化により、再びロシアの戦争が変わりつつある。かつてのロシア戦車は、物量でドイツ軍を圧倒することを目標に設計されていた。しかし当時の工業力はその戦術を取ることを許さず、物量戦という単語だけがひとり歩きする状況に陥っていた。日本やドイツといった諸国のドクトリンは、戦車の機動力と戦闘能力に主軸を置いている。彼らの技術を研究することで、様々な面での進歩が得られるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_tanks_for_peace_desc: "20年前の侵略から得られた教訓とは、機械化された軍隊は恐るべき脅威であるということだ。機甲師団の速度と攻撃能力を前に、ロシアの諸部隊は各地で分断、圧倒された。ソ連邦を守れるだけの戦車を生産できなかったことは、ブハーリンの失敗であり、決して繰り返してはならない。他の軍閥も、今では同じ結論に達していることだろう。自由地区の防衛に必要なのは、装甲技術のさらなる発展である。"
 SBA_regional_compile_the_strategies_desc: "軍隊改革や、基礎的軍事ドクトリンを用いた行動の施行といった最近の努力に関わらず、将校の多くは最適解に反して、結局彼ら自身の戦術や攻撃戦略を実行している。我々は、将校らが実行できるような、統一された一つの軍事ドクトリンを形成する努力をすべきだろう。それは、我々の命運を決め得る戦争中に、もっと大規模な戦略を実行できるようにするためにも必要である。そして、このことにより、戦争の進行の仕方や我々の軍の能力についても深く理解できるようになり、単に将校の決断に期待するよりも、良い結果を生むだろう。"
 SBA_regional_military_egalitarianism_desc: "黒衛軍の最も顕著な特徴の一つに、民主的な軍隊構成をしている点がある。多くの他の軍隊と違って、権力は将軍や地位の高い軍指導者からトップダウン的に降りてくるのではなく、むしろ最も地位の低い兵士から上がって来るのである。兵士達は、彼らが就く将校を選び、彼らが考えた上で、最も備えある人物を昇進させるのである。軍事指揮系統の長たる将軍の価値は、軍の他の人々と同じぐらい平等なのである。軍の人々が、彼らと同じぐらい懸命に戦っているのはこのためだからこそなのだ。"
 SBA_regional_the_tomsk_firearms_collective_desc: "トムスクの人々は、我々の民主主義のやり方によく適応しており、既に利用可能な地域の民主主義構造を持っているが、防衛において極めて重要な銃文化にはまだ適応できていない。武器を買うことへの興味を持っていないか、買うためのお金を持っていないかのどちらかなのだが、多くの人々は武器を持つ必要性を感じておらず、軍隊に守ってもらえれば良いと思っているようだ。我々が今ここに居ることが、この態度が明らかに正しくないものであることを示している。それ故に、トムスクの人々への教育機関をつくり、銃の必要性や使い方を学んでもらう必要がある。"
 SBA_regional_an_army_for_liberation_desc: "黒衛軍の究極の任務は、アナーキズムの生活様式を全ロシアに広めることでなければならない。その結果として、信念を持った人々が国家の圧政から解放されるかもしれないのだ。防衛の場合も特にそうだが、我々は攻撃に出る準備しておかねばならない。伝統的に、黒衛軍の徴集兵は、故郷を守るために参加しているのであって、他の国を侵略するために参加しているのではない。だか、故郷を守るためには、他の全ての人々も解放してやらねばならないということを彼らに納得させなければならない。まもなく全ロシアに黒旗が掲げられる。"
 SBA_regional_an_army_for_self_defense_desc: "市民軍の目的は、守ることであって、傷つけることでは無い。黒衛軍は、恐怖を与えるヤゴダの軍隊とは違うのだ。彼らは、支配と権力のために戦っていたが、我々は平和とパンのために戦うのだ。我々が過去に行った征服が、未来に少しも影響を与えてはならない。シベリア黒衛軍と自由地区の尊厳や一体性を守るために、我々は先人のように圧政の道を辿ることを防がねばならない。そして、恐らくそうすることによって我々は最終的に成功できるかもしれない。"
 SBA_regional_looking_outwards_desc: "ちょうど軍隊や戦争と同じように、地政学は外交力と機転のゲームである。自由地区の安全を守るために、我々は西側や東側の隣人に対して、我々の立場を評価し、彼らが我々に取って脅威であるか否か、どれ程の脅威をもたらすのかを査定しなければならない。そして、幸運にも自由地区と国境を接する隣国と良好な関係を築けた場合、貿易関係や防衛協定を手配することが、我々の利益となるかもしれない。"
 SBA_regional_a_policy_of_liberation_desc: "安全保障委員会は、この問題についてある程度議論した後、世界的な解放を目指す方針を発表した。もし外国の社会主義仲間や、無政府主義の友人を支持する機会があれば、我々はそのチャンスを逃すべきでない。軍隊、資金、技術……。もし需要があれば、我々はそれらを提供するように努めよう。我々が、全ての国に革命の炎を燃やす導火線になろうではないか。このことは、世界の同胞から不興を買うかもしれないし、恐らく、我々への攻撃を誘発しさえするだろう。だが、もし人々が抑圧されている国の解放に、我々が一カ国でも役に立てば、我々の努力は無駄でなかったと知ることになろう。"
 SBA_regional_a_policy_of_protection_desc: "安全保障委員会は、この問題についてある程度議論した後、自衛を目指す方針を発表した。最も避けるべきことは、日本やドイツを怒らせ、再びロシアを破滅させる戦争を引き起こすことである。仮に、社会主義者や無政府主義者が抑圧者から自身を解放したり、彼らの国でキャンペーンを始めたりしたとしたら、我々は全面的に支援するが、武器は提供しない。それに、国外の衝突に介入してもろくな事がないだろう。アメリカを見れば分かるが、彼らがこんなにも長く南アフリカに滞在することになるとは、予期していたかどうか疑わしい。"
 SBA_regional_exporting_the_revolution_desc: "世界中にいる社会主義や無政府主義の友人を支援するためには、まず彼らを探し当てる必要がある。今、新しい組織が設立されようとしている。その組織は、秘密裏に動くが世界規模である。その目的は何か？世界の革命家を探し当て、援助することだ。革命家には、自身の中に革命家が眠っていると、まだ気づいていない人さえ含めるのだ。我々の国境から最も遠いアフリカや南米にさえ、我々の構成員がいるし、人々が自身を解放するための手段や動機を与えている。それをプロパガンダと呼ぶ人もいるかもしれないが、我々は好んでそれを真理だと呼ぼう。"
 SBA_regional_declare_a_safe_harbor_desc: "世界は厳しい場所になった。世界の至る所で人々は、人種、宗教、イデオロギーなどの理由で迫害を受けている。自由地区にはそのようなものは無い。自由地区は、真の自由があるとはっきり言える、地球上で数少ない国家の一つなのである。我々は、世界に向けて国境を開放し、世界の「避難港」となるのだ。我々の国境内で破壊活動を起こすつもりがない限りだが、我々の壮大な実験への参加を歓迎する。加えて、移民というのは我々にも利益を与えてくれる。人口が増えれば増えるほど、我らは身を守りやすくなるだろう。"
 SBA_regional_an_eye_to_the_world_desc: "ロシアとは厳しい「女王」だが、我々の隣国はより一層厳しい。我々は身を守るために、彼らが何をしているのか常に知っておく必要がある。この目的を達成するために、ある種の秘密組織を作らねばならない。仮に、隣国が我々に対して行動を開始しても、それを把握することができる。仮に、隣国が新しい戦車や航空機を開発したとしても、そのことは把握済みになる。隣国の指導者が我々の領土に彼の「犬」を解き放ったとしても、それは我々の知る所になる。この新しい機関により、黒衛軍はあらゆる包囲者に関与することができ、全ての国に目を向けることができるのだ。"
 SBA_regional_solidarity_with_the_world_desc: "諜報機関を設立するのは単純な仕事ではない。巨大で重要な何かを秘密裏に作るときは、時間と辛抱が必要なのだ。決められるべき事項に、取るべき方向性。例えば、防諜組織は、攻撃的な情報機関とは運営方法も構造もしばしば異なっている。長期間に渡る浸透や監視への注力が、外国への扇動や密輸よりも重要となるかもしれない。どちらかの選択が悪いという訳では無い。ただ何処にリソースを割くかが違うだけだ。"

No more will the people of Magadan suffer under this injustice.\n\nIn an effort to root out the fascists and restore power to the people, we must redistribute the arms imported from America, and ensure that all within the port city are aware of the misdeeds done to them by the fascists of years past. Reminding them that those years are passed, and the best is yet to begin will only bring the city onto the side of Siuda."

They will tell you of the securocratic measures implemented without end in sight. They will tell you of the NKVD kicking down doors in the night, all in the name of a doomed nation. They will tell you of the Siberian War against the Central Siberian Republic, doing nothing but wearing both nations down to nothing, and devastating the birthplace of Siberian anarchism. Why, then, do the people of Irkutsk continue to think of the madman fondly?\n\nIt is something of a mystery, that is without question, though now is not the time to ponder why some may idolize the tyrant, so much as it is to strike these memories down. Those that do not remember the worst excesses of the NKVD will be shown how horrific Yagoda's reign was, whether or not they want to hear it."

Leading this brave rebellion was a man known as Valery Sablin, and his intentions were once pure. However, as soon as this man gained an inch of power, he betrayed his beliefs. Enacting conscription, the elimination of his political enemies, and countless other oppressive acts, it would not take long until Valery Sablin closely resembled the very man he meant to oppose. Even now, there are those in Buryatia who continue to celebrate the actions of Sablin. This must come to an end.\n\nJust as a supposed \"Second Red October\" occurred within Buryatia, there must be a counterbalance to this horrible misjudgment; the first Black October will occur within the city, and all will know of the wonders of anarchism."

Of course, those of the northern Siberian wastelands do not share our sentiment. If we hope to bring them onto our side, we will need to strike a compromise with the local communes.\n\nWhile this will likely do plenty for our popularity, it may not be enough to bring all of the region to our side. As a result, it has been decided that Siuda will begin a variety of charities during his trip to the north. With a little bit of luck, it may be enough to bring the north onto our side."

Similarly clear to Stepanov is the one thing that seems to work well with the people of Buryatia; populism.\n\nSomething which is known to all those within the Black Army is the simple fact that we cannot allow for Siuda to reach the region before we do. If so much as a whisper from Siuda reaches the other side of the Baikal, we may completely lose Buryatia. This can not happen.

If anyone is going to warn the north wasteland of Siuda's intentions, then it is us.\n\nIvan Stepanov will visit northern Siberia, and inform them of Siuda's horrible beliefs, of strictly enforced state atheism, and of oppressing the north into the Free Territories.

As the protests have already been crushed beneath the competent soldiers at home, we now stand with several brave Siberian Black Army members and substantially fewer residents to the city of Tomsk.

That is where their similarities end, however.\n\nAs Stepanov has worked tirelessly to become the preeminent leader of the Free Territories, Mishurenko has instead labored to prepare the Siberian Black Army to retake Russia from the Germanic occupiers. Regardless of differences, however, it is clear that Stepanov's past efforts to court Mishurenko must come to a head, otherwise, Stepanov will forever lose out on a close ally."

As we approach the final days until a clear victor is decided, it is clear that we only have so much time. Due to his strong ideological convictions, we have no way to bring Valenteev onto our side, not with the time we have. The solution, then, is simple.\n\nValenteev is too powerful, too ideologically opposed, and too far into Siuda's sphere that there is no longer anything that can be done for him. It is such a shame that there happens to be a plot of a... radical, extremist anarchist who is looking to rid the Siberian Black Army of all statism.\n\nSuch a shame for Valenteev."

They abuse like their predecessors, own property like their predecessors, and kill like their predecessors. And, by the same token, capitalists are naught more than fascists hiding behind the facade of goodwill. There are many among us today who would balk at that assessment, arguing instead that capitalism is good for the country, and would serve to improve the nation. This assessment is most certainly false, as evidenced by the Banana Republics of Central America, or the rejected poor of the United States.

 SBA.30.desc: "There are many ways to achieve justice. Alexandra had plotted her options from the very moment the man with the dark, blotchy, beard grabbed her wrist as she left the bar. While he dragged her deeper into the alley, Alexandra pictured his head split open, his heartbeat visible in the pulsations of his brain. While she knelt before him, looking up to him undoing his belt, she pictured being in the same position, watching his limp body swing from the gallows. As she laid in the dumpster, discarded like trash after use, she counted the ways to get justice.\n\nThe following morning, Alexandra had made up her mind. Murder would not bring her justice. Attempting to ignore the incident as her mother had done before her would not bring her justice. Alexandra refused to carry the baggage dropped on her by a stranger, a scoundrel who believed he was above the men around him, that he could decide the fate of others. He was the kind of man that would feel victorious if she allowed her rage to overcome her, if he could deprive her of the same humanity he lacked. He would not win.\n\nThe village had come to her call. Not all of them, of course. Many still within the city viewed the woman, even the liberated one, as one who existed to be housewives, to be a bearer of children. Those who stormed the home of the man who forced himself upon her were the true revolutionaries, she decided. Those who dragged him out kicking and screaming, as she was the night prior, were the men and women who would bring change to Russia. The people of the village who stood as a tribunal around the man, a fascist wanderer from the eastern realm, and sentenced him to death, had prevented the man from winning. Alexandra did not concede to rage, she had found justice in the compassion of the people."

The man described in the file was a complete stranger to the man in rags before him. He had lost twenty pounds, at least.

His charges include perpetrating unjust human suffering, suppressing the native people of Mongolia, and reactionary violence.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Comrade.\" The aged officer waved away the escort, his attention turned to the man before him. \"You're a soldier?\" The man nodded. \"A good one?\" Another nod. \"With respect to you in mind, I'll ask a quite blunt question.

They had swept around the left, aiming for entrance by the back door. Catch the falcon in his nest.\n\nAloysha held his weapon tight to his chest as he crept. This was stupid, he thought, there was no way Pokryshkin was even still in the building. He looked off to the woods in his peripherals. Nothing. Wait, was that... A pale head? A bald man in the woods? Alyosha squinted to get a better look and the figure was gone. Stupid boy! He could hear his father's words in his head. His body told him to move but his eyes remained peeled on the woods. He had taken a mental picture and was comparing it to his current vision. At the smallest twitch of a branch, his gut told him to run.\n\nA snap, someone stepping on a twig. Alyosha looked around to his squadmates, none of them heard the break. Now, his gut told him.\n\nAlyosha panted as he ran, his gun swinging wildly from side to side. No way. There was no way. As he got closer and closer, deeper and deeper into the woods, he thought of how foolish this endeavor was. His legs kept moving regardless. He came to a clearing, a small airstrip visible in the distance. Before him, a pudgy green figure, his head bald meandered in the distance. Aloysha knew he should raise his rifle and he did, lining up a clear shot. He would bag a falcon today. What a story that would be, a young recruit, taking down the figurehead of the state he despised? Aloysha told himself to pull the trigger but no bullet fired. He could see, even from the great distance between them, the desperation in Pokryshkin's running. He was fighting for his life, just like Aloysha."

Building communes from the ground up was never easy, and integrating them into the greater whole of the Free Territory was even harder.

There was no going back now, he had lead too many armies, too many had died. He must charge ahead at full speed now, inaction now would spell the death of the anarchist movement. Pyotr pushed off from the gate and continued his walk to the General Assembly.\n\nThrowing open the doors, Pyotr saw the usual suspects, Stepanov at his desk, writing something. Valenteev gesturing to a map decorated with cities labeled friendly and opposed and Mishuernko attempting to cross out all the ones labeled friendly. And hundreds of other people, chatting about the assembly hall. Pyotr smiled to himself, they were a rag-tag bunch. He found that fitting for the torchbearers of anarchism, it ought to be a movement of many people from all backgrounds. Pyotr shook hands with Valenteev and nodded in respect to Mishuernko before taking his seat on the bench.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, as the last of us trickle in on the chilly Siberian morning, I would like to say a few words before we begin.\" Siuda stood in awe of the crowd, of the movement. \"What we have done here is what the nightmares of Tsars and fascists alike are made of! We have stood up, together! Through our loyalty to each other we have freed our people of the tyranny of the state, but much more is to come. We have a lot before us, I can tell you it won't be simple or enjoyable all the time. It will be hard. All good things in life are fought for, not handed to us. We have fought for freedom here but I cannot sleep at night, Comrades, knowing there is still so much work left to do.\" Pyotr watched as the doors to the assembly closed. \"I believe we are all here, if you'd take you seats, we can begin.\""

She fiddled with the papers, smiling awkwardly to the Security Council, her pearly white teeth nearly blinding many of its members. Pyotr gave her a nod and the blonde haired woman began speaking.\n\n\"Good morning ladies and gentlemen of Kansk! My name is Sofia Petrova, I was a wealthy upstart from the city of Tomsk.\" She paused for a second, trying to gauge the audience reaction. \"My life revolved around administering my father's business, caring for my two lovely girls, and expanding my knowledge with the night classes I'd attend. All three of which were taken from me.\" Sofia's smile flickered for just a second, like the flame of a candle being blown on. \"I am not here to give you kind folks my sob story,\" the woman said, retrieving a silk handkerchief from her pocket and dabbing at her crystal blue eyes. \"I'm here to say there is good in the world. That not everyone in that city was evil. I have wholeheartedly accepted that this is simply the way things go! You know?\" The woman laughed a little too hard to the silent audience. Sofia, not missing a single beat, continued on. \"I know you are angry and that you want justice, I want justice too, but I ask you show mercy in your justice. Tomsk was pillaged. We lost everything. We are willing to not only live within this land, but love it, we yearn to experience your brotherhood. My only caution,\" Sofia offered a pathetic half smile, \"let the people build equality, don't thrust it upon them.\"\n\nSofia descended the podium, her head down as she returned to her seat. She crossed her legs and put on her biggest grin, she knew in some communes they would've shot her just for saying she administered a business.

What so many forget due to their unwavering commitment to God is the role of the Church. On surface level, one would be hard pressed to guess the church as the root of all evil, but it wouldn't be too far from the truth.\n\nBelieving in God is opposed to the anarchist mindset in and of itself. To be a servant of God is to be in doubt of the power of the individual above all else. Those who draft the different versions of the Bible take the chance to manipulate the people's will to their own. As the centuries have passed, the word of God, if it even existed, has been twisted and mangled to the point it is hardly recognizable. A free land means freedom from all tools of the state, to which the church is just one of many.\n\nThat being said, the motion to confiscate the wealth of the church was one of brutal debate with the priest of Kansk engaging in a multiple hour long debate with Siuda over the use of the church for good and for evil."

This city is where it all began, where he first protested against the Central Siberian Republic's hypocrisy, where he organized a revolt, where he developed a friendship with Ivan Stepanov, a man he would've disdained. He supposed that was the beauty of anarchy, he didn't know what would come next. He certainly knew would he would like to do, but would he ever achieve them? He was unsure. He had heard reports from both the east and west, neither were promising. In the middle of them both, was the Free Territory, the safe zone between the statists. They would most certainly send their planes and tanks, but what they would falter on is their message. A person will not become a fascist or a socialist if you shoot them long enough. What changes people is words, a uniquely human trait.\n\nSiuda saw the thousands crowding the city square and he saw hope, a people who had seen enough suffering for their lifetime.

Those of you who are joining us for the first time and those who have followed us since the beginning, I welcome you.\" The people began to applaud, some chanting his name, something that didn't sit right with Pyotr. Regardless, he continued on. \"Today the greatest struggle to come to Russia enters its next stage. We will face enemies who wish to divide us, to subvert our agenda and substitute their own.

He could barely believe how everything had changed, like a train barreling it's way down the tracks with the breaks cut. They had to run out of rail eventually right? One day the people would realize that killing everyone in a mob would not be the solution to their problems, surely. He wouldn't be the one to find out. Pyotr stepped off the train. Here he was. Biysk. Pyotr looked around for any sign of civilization, he was the only one stepping off the train after all. He had been briefed that the city was a backwater, it was his job to do his best appraisal, see what was good as is, what could be improved, and what had to be scrapped entirely. Before the collapse of, well, everything, Pyotr did the same job, just often accompanied by armed guards and motivated by a large pay. Now, he was alone, in anarchy, looking out at a bunch of sheep farmers, tasked with turning the city into a metropolis. Pyotr walked around the \"city\", if one could even call it that. For the most part the rural people of Biysk kept to themselves, which made gathering info difficult. He saw a bar in the distance, the only thing more common than the rail in Russia. Pyotr walked in, set down his briefcase and began jotting down his notes. Abruptly, he felt a tap on his should.\n\n\"Hey stranger, Who are you?\" The barkeep asked.\n\nPyotr cleared his throat before answering, \"I'm just doing surveying the town! Just a little research for the eggheads in Novosibirsk!\" Pyotr laughed awkwardly. Damn it, why was he being so awkward?\n\nThe woman smiled despite his nervous demeanor and said, \"Well Pyotr, I hope you say good things about us, we don't get the love we deserve.\" The woman winked and walked away, leaving a stunned and confused Pyotr alone with his notes. He shook his head and looked back at the paper, but the words were blurred. He looked back at the barkeep, conversing with an elderly man. The two shared a hearty laugh.

He was only seventeen, had never held a gun to his life, and understood next to nothing of tactics but what he lacked in military theory, he made up for in stories. The boy was in love with the idea of heroism and what was more heroic than the army?\n\n\"Hey!\" The same squad mate called out, \"You gonna hump the side of the vehicle or are you gonna get over here so the rest of the team can get on?\" Stefan nodded, lunging from the one side of the armored vechicle to the other, the one with the benches. \"So what are you doing here?\" the burly man questioned.\n\n\"Well, I, uh,\" Stefan cleared his throat, \"Well I guess I just wanted to help out?\"\n\n\"Yeah well you're doing a hell of a job,\" the seasoned veteran sneered.

Not only did this make her one of the founding members of the Free Territory, it gave her a foresight like no other. The enemies of Russia were not to be found just beyond the Urals or in the port of Magadan. The enemies of anarchism were the superpowers of the world, those who sought to preserve the status-quo.

By extension, this means safeguarding our pre-existing communes.

His division broke through hastily-erected barricades, fought poorly-trained men, and in a few hours the city was back under the Free Territory's control.\n\nBut that was the problem, \"control\".\n\nIosif was too young to fight when the people of Kansk fought for freedom from the Central Siberian Republic, but his father had often told him stories of that time. How they took up arms against oppression, defended their towns from a better-equipped military, was this not the same plight of the revolt in Tomsk?\n\nHe couldn't shake this idea from his mind, he was fighting to keep a city \"under control\", not to free it."

If things went well, she could prevent the Kostinty Union from seceding. She had to be quick, however. Stepanov and the generals were planning something, and whatever it was, she knew it was stupid.\n\n\"Not at all, Comrade Kostin,\" Taratuta took a seat, and Kostin eventually followed suit, \"I understand that you and the Kostinty Union are angry about the rejection of your motion.\"\n\n\"Well yeah, the 'Siberian Plan' is just statist justification for taking away our rights! If you won't demilitarize it, then we won't be a part of it.\"\n\n\"I know, and I sympathise with your demands, but the Security Council still sees the statists to the east and west as too much of a threat, if we demilitarize the plan, they'll smother our revolution like statists have done every other time in history. This is a temporary measure, I assure you I dislike it as much as you do,\" Taratuta seemed to have struck a chord with Kostin, and he seemed to be contemplating what she was saying when a worker barged into the room, rifle in hand.\n\n\"Comrade Kostin! The Black Army! They're attacking the city!\"\n\nBoth of them stood up in shock, \"What the hell is that fool doing?!\" shouted Taratuta. She turned to Kostin but he was already barking out orders.\n\n\"Inform the others! Those militarists have shown their true colors,\" Kostin turned to Taratuta, \"You seem genuine, but your allies most certainly are not. I'd suggest leaving now, things could get ugly,\" as he said this, he picked up a rifle and headed out the door."

Now the General Assembly wasn't a perfect system, but it was at least a democratic one. However, the recent military crackdowns-\"\n\n\"Are an entirely temporary measure, I assure you. I don't agree with the crackdowns either, but the recent events-\"\n\n\"The recent events caused by your generals? Your soldiers? Your decisions?

The Black Army are assaulting the city, and we're moving you to a safer location, sir,\" Taratuta was furious. Stepanov had decided brute force was the perfect solution to an incredibly delicate situation.\n\nNekrasov got up to leave, leaving Taratuta in her seat, and turned to her, \"I hope you now understand our position. You may leave, if you like, but I am needed elsewhere,\" with that said, he left through the door. Leaving Taratuta to stew in her anger."

All have issued blistering condemnations of the Black Army's actions towards Tomsk and Novosibirsk, and have mobilized their militias for regional defense, should it be needed.\n\nWith little more than the original core territories in Kansk remaining loyal to the General Assembly, it is not yet known what the response, if any, to this newest development will be.

He, and his subordinates, were convinced that had that interference not been present, the situation would already have been resolved, and the Free Territory once again unified in land and purpose. But such was not the case.\n\nAnd so the influence of that Assembly had to be curtailed. By the radical action that he had decided upon. Issuing orders to the formations under his command, he had relocated his forces to the area in and around Tuva, seizing control of the region from the central government. It possessed both a strategic location and a sufficient resource and population base to support them both in recuperation and, hopefully, in support of future offenses.\n\nStepanov hoped the action would not be permanent, though of course he knew the possibility of such existed.

He had also made clear the intention of himself and others to re-establish the Siberian Soviet, and had taken the first steps needed in order to do so.\n\nAs he would learn later, the proclamation had caught the Council completely off guard, with the sudden loss of territory and supply lines meaning that Stepanov's forces could not take immediate action against him.

Stepanov's cap had been crumbled into a near circular shape, and his sweaty palms would squeeze for as long as his high blood pressure would let him, before relaxing out with a deep, shaky sigh. Siuda had taken off the pin that adorned his uniform and let it dance between his fingers, drawing blood often as it pricked and poked at his pale skin. Around them, hundreds of staffers, elected officers, and assembly-goers mimicked their actions, practicing their own nervous tics.\n\n\"Someone should've brought booze.\" The gentle voice of Taratuta was powerful enough to break the fragile silence. Her quip elicited a polite chuckle from some around her, those who had grown tired of sitting by the radio, waiting for it to spring to life and assure them that their fears were unfounded. Silence had recuperated its strength and fell over them once more.\n\nSuddenly, and mercifully, the machine began to crackle to life. Silence turned to static, and from static, words. \"Give me that! I'll do it. Command? This...\" The voice on the other end faded to static again, eliciting Stepanov to smack the radio across the side. \"...successful. Currently, we are operating out of Zenya. Resistance....\" The audience of the radio whipped their heads around frantically, seeking anyone able to remedy the poor connection. \"....unconditional surrender. We've won.\"\n\nAs all around them people exploded out of their seats, embracing whoever was closest, Ivan Stepanov sat and Pyotr Siuda stood. Two statues, monuments to anarchism. Stepanov's first instinct, to indulge in the celebration was smothered by a realization, he had no control over eastern Siberia, no loyal officers to bribe, no assemblies to veto. Siuda experienced a similar realization, his message did not extend to the far corners of Magadan, his popular influence had been boxed in by the boundaries of Central Siberia. Stepanov moved first, standing suddenly, nearly adjusting his cap to cover his balding head, and set off. Siuda wasted no time, following close behind."

Pyotr Siuda threw his glass against the grandfather clock, sending shards flying across the room. He promised himself he wouldn't let drinking become a habit, but desperate times called for desperate measures. No matter how many cups he hurled, it wouldn't stop the progression of time. It would not delay his departure slated for just three hours into the future. Siuda took a deep breath, summoning a belch from deep inside him, and stumbled to his feet. Careful to avoid the broken glass, Siuda stopped at his kitchen table where a map of the Far East had been draped over it like a tablecloth.\n\nJust looking at it made him sick, or maybe that was the hangover to be? Regardless, he felt like puking. There was so much more to Russia than just what he saw, and he had seen a lot. Pretender kings and corporate republics, cities of art and Red Army military zones, he had ventured across the entire political spectrum just in his own little slice of Russia. He was familiar with surface level knowledge of the warlords to his east; he knew of the Tsar, the twin Vozhds, Yagoda and his greatest enemy, he was even familiar with one called The Father, a religious type who sought to synchronize the church with anarchism. The mere thought of it compounded his already miserable headache. He didn't even want to think about what was to the west.\n\nSiuda slumped down in his chair, and started absentmindedly at the map. Rodzaevsk, huh, certainly not a humble man. It wasn't just the fascists, Siuda began to realize, there was no faction of the people in the East. He readjusted his posture and swiped a pen off the adjacent counter and began crossing off states. Between monarchists, fascists, and statists, it began to settle in for Siuda just how miserable life was in the East. He stood, forced into sobriety, and began to pace back and forth. The old Siuda had returned, the man who would spend the rest of morning plotting out just how he would turn the region around."

I made all the arrangements as you slept last night. The vehicles are already in transit.\" Siuda stood with his arms crossed, facing the winding path that led into the woods, and out of what was known as Rodzaevsk. Yevgeniya sighed in defeat. It's not that he was purposefully ignoring her advice, he just knew he was right! There had to be some sort of return to normalcy in the city, to wash away the stain for good.\n\nThe distant hum of engines brought both of them to attention. There was no going back now, and after this was over, Siuda promised he would never let Yevgeniya live down her worrying over nothing. Soon, the hum turned to a rumble, and buses revealed themselves to the world. Finally, the first bus came to a stop meters away from them both. Siuda made his way to the door, and waited as people began to step off, suitcases in tow. \"Welcome, comrades, welcome home!\" The fascist regime had displaced and deported hundreds of Jewish and native peoples from land that had been in their families for generations. This wouldn't do for Pyotr.\n\nAn bald man was the last off the bus, walking down the steps slowly and deliberately, his thick, rectangular, suitcase overflowing with his belongings. Siuda moved to help him, but the bald man stopped him. \"You're the one who brought us here, aren't you?\" Siuda only nodded. The bald man gripped Siuda's hand tightly, and Siuda got to fully observe the man, his patchy skin and scruffy face. The man stared deep into his eyes, \"Thank you. This place is my home.

He had taken to writing them at the behest of a record-keeper he met in Novosibirsk, 'important fragments of history' as she called them. \"Yevgeniya, come look! This will be an excellent way to kick off our anti-fascist campaign.\"\n\nYevgeniya sauntered over to Siuda, and plucked the paper from his hands. \"This community is healing,\" she read over her glasses, \"returning refugees is our medicine, and tolerance is the cure.\" Taratuta made a face, raising her eyebrow, \"Since when did you become a doctor?\" Pyotr rolled his eyes as he sipped from his tea. \"It's good,\" she acquiesced, \"Might make someone cry.\"\n\nThe pleasant conversation was cut short by a ferocious beating on the door. The two occupants of the house froze, watching the door intently, just waiting for it to fly open. It didn't. There came no more knocks. No more sounds at all. The two looked at each other, making conversation without a word. Slowly, Siuda rose from his seat, and crept his way to the door. He didn't have a gun, but Taratuta kept her pistol close to her side. Siuda took a deep breath, and threw open the door abruptly.\n\nNo one was there.\n\nAt the doorstep, however, was a note. Pyotr snatched it from the ground and slammed the door in one fluid motion. Taratuta watched as Siuda scanned over the paper, eyes moving frantically from word to word as though he had to keep track of them or else they would envelop him. After an eternity of silence, Siuda turned to face Yevgeniya, brow furrowed in confusion. \"They're just names. It's just a list of names.

A crowd is a separate species from a human in the way it moves and operates. The beast before him roared out loudly, demanding answers. Siuda ran a hand through his hair. Jesus.\n\n\"Enough!\" He commanded and the crowd fell silent. \"What happened last night was a tragedy, but if we fight between ourselves, we'll obtain justice!\"\n\n\"A tragedy?\" Shouted the beast, \"Thirty people were killed!\" The beast raged, \"You brought us here! You led us to be slaughtered! The fascists aren't gone, we aren't safe!\" The beast repeated the mantra again and again, drowning out Siuda and his futile attempts to tame the creature. The two threatened to tear each other apart, until a gunshot rang out through the town, silencing them both.\n\nAt the tail of the beast, a middle aged man of average height and build, stood ram-rod straight, his weapon pointed high into the air. \"Comrade Siuda, I apologize for having to use such methods to get your attention, but I feel that what I will say is important enough to warrant it.\" The man stepped forward, the beast disassembling around him as he moved effortlessly through the crowd. \"I was born here, but was forced into exile during the dictatorship as both my father was Jewish. My family fled all the way to Novosibirsk, to the city of promise, the oasis of Siberia. That was when I first heard your ideals, and became a devoted follower. What has always impressed me, and what has surely brought you from that city to here, is your ability to foster unity.\"\n\nThe man stepped closer to the stage and offered a hand to Siuda, \"I go by Abakumov.

The process of denazification had become an obsession to Siuda, and even his worst enemies could credit him for being a man of firm ideological conviction. The desire to blot out the last remnant of Russian fascism consumed him. The trip to Rodzaevsk was only meant to last five days, before he was set to travel to other parts of the East, but the days blended together as the townspeople he had taken under his wing grew more and more paranoid that at any moment, the killer, or killers, could strike again.\n\nAbakumov had made a name for himself as the town's sheriff, though he renounced the title. He was able to effectively bridge the gap between the population who still held Siuda in high regard, and those who saw him to blame. Abakumov, under the advice of Siuda, formed the Emergency Anti-Fascist Committee. A board of five individuals, none of which were Siuda. For once, he found himself in the crowd, rather than in the assembly. Taratuta, however, had been chosen, and essentially acted as his voice on the committee.\n\nThe committee had been planning for days, strategizing for defense, and following dead-end leads. Though Siuda desperately wanted to help, the popular will was against him here, despite his best intentions. He could only watch helplessly as neighbor began to accuse neighbor of being the Ghost of Rodzaevsky, as the terrorist had become known.\n\nWhile preparing for yet another day at the committee hearing, Siuda received a transmission over the radio. \"Comrade Siuda!\" Came the relieved voice, \"This is General Valenteev. I'm in Irkutsk, or what will be left of it. Entire army units have split into factions, the military apparatus of governance is completely crippled. Moreover, some of the Union bureaucrats have taken this opportunity to attempt to regain power through subverting our systems and popular resistance. I can't do anything, the situation is completely out of control. If we lose control over the power supply here, we could be without electricity in major cities.

Despite his desire to sleep, he couldn't shake the feeling that what he was doing was wrong. He was never one to start a project and not finish it, now wouldn't be a good time to start. Even with that in mind, what else was he supposed to do? Sit idly by? A good anarchist always respects the people's will, and the people chose to be rid of him.\n\nIrkutsk reeked, that's what he noticed first. As Siuda made his way down the main avenue, accompanied by his recently increased security, he finally saw what most did when they pictured anarchy. Shattered glass peppered the streets, fires raged inside of buildings, and it was evident that the sanitation system had been completely abandoned. Unnerving, but not necessarily damning. Siuda had been to actual warzones, where battles were being actively fought, and the urban decay hardly came close.\n\nSiuda stopped at the gate to the Presidium. Before he and Stepanov set out East, scattered like dust in the wind, Siuda had already designated many landmarks as possible prime locations for local assemblies. The Presidium was the crown jewel of them all, with an assembly there, it would be clear that the Soviet system has been usurped by that of the anarchists. Siuda knocked twice on the door, paused, and then once more. On cue, the door swung open, and Siuda and his guard were ushered inside.\n\nThe Presidium was far from the jewel promised. The windows had been boarded up, and entire wings of the building had been repurposed to house people. The many rows of tables, once occupied by the Union elite, were filled by three men and two women, whose quiet discussion died out as the door closed. General Valenteev, surely a sight for sore eyes, rounded a corner just in time to come face to face with Siuda. \"Comrade!\" He exclaimed, \"I didn't expect your arrival this early but I'm glad you're here.

If the armed forces could not effectively fulfill their duty to uphold the common order and protect the community, anarchism would never get off the ground. Secondly, the lack of political foundation, partially caused by Siuda's trip to Rodzaevsk, meant that the educated elite were able to manipulate the people into simply democratically electing to restore the Supreme Soviet. Finally, the people don't care.\n\n\"You're on blocks A, B, and D.\" Siuda commanded a bustling army of soldiers, civilians, and slackers, \"Remember, we're working with limited resources. Ration food carefully, but without being frugal.\" As people swarmed all around him, sectioned off into roles that best suit their talents, Siuda could only watch as a stupid grin crept across his face. A night's worth of planning had turned the survivors to community leaders. After some time, the relief effort began to run itself. Food was delivered on time, repairs were conducted all throughout the day, and the workers of the sanitation system returned to their essential duties.\n\nSiuda crept out through one of many doors, and elected to take a look around the city.

Even when he could not find it within himself to believe that he could do what was right for Russia, she always could. Siuda could only wish the best for his friend, and wonder what she was up to.\n\nThe question would have to wait. When Siuda finally returned to the main hall, he heard the first indication of life, and peaked out the window to get a handle on the situation before having to face it himself. The city center was split into six roads which coalesced at a fountain in the middle. Endless rows of people lined each street, carrying signs, children, and weapons. Siuda squinted to get a better view of the different groups. The kaleidoscope of ideologies, branching out into a circle, ranged from the easily identifiable followers of Yagoda, still waving the banner of the Union, to those supporting ideologies Siuda wasn't even sure he could define. This situation was untenable, and the hard work done to repair the city would be for nothing if it tore itself apart again.\n\nEveryone in Irkutsk had gathered in the small section of town, necessitating Siuda to force his way to the front. Finally at the fountain, it became clear what was going on. Representatives of the six factions had met to lay out their demands. One of the representatives saw Siuda and sprung from his seat, jogging over to him. \"You, you're Pyotr Siuda!\" The man swung an arm around him, \"You're just in time, you can save this!\" Siuda wasn't quite sure what he was supposed to be saving, but the brewing conflict didn't seem appealing to him at all in the slightest. Coincidentally, Siuda made eye contact with General Valenteev, as he too fought his way up through the belly of the beast."

No less than two hours after the call for soldiers was sounded, men had started to appear over the horizon. Those two hours, however, were excruciating.\n\nGeneral Valenteev ducked back into the crowd, squirming his way towards the Presidium, and to his radio. Siuda, once again, was alone in a sea of bodies. This wasn't his home. This wasn't Kansk. These people were not his neighbors or friends, their politics were not related to him in the slightest. The realization struck him, then. There was much more of Russia, and a whole world, outside the frontier of the Free Territory. For a second, his idealism faltered.\n\nThe protests had largely died out by the time the Army arrived. People just...went home. Got bored. Siuda felt dizzy. Now, he had used the Black Army for nothing, and opened the door for him to use the Army as a crutch whenever he got in a tight spot. Valenteev returned to congratulate him on handling the situation well, but the victory felt hollow. It felt as though he was incredibly close to resolving the situation peacefully, and making a working agreement for the city, but had recused himself from the negotiations entirely and waited for the military to bail him out. Soldiers began to set up shop in the city, and although there was no doubt they would bring stability and justice with them, the harsh glances from the city's residents mitigated any of the positivity it could've brought.\n\nSiuda climbed into his vehicle, resigned to return to Kansk, carrying home with him a failure in Rodzaevsk and a Pyrrhic victory in Irkutsk. \"Hello, Pyotr.\" Siuda immediately recognized the voice as that of Taratuta's. He saw her in the back passenger seat and climbed next to her. \"I hope things went better for you than they did for us.\""

Siuda shrugged, and smiled to the man, \"What can I help you with?\"\n\nSiuda had come to know the names of the six representatives rather quickly. Each group wanted something of the other, as is only natural during negotiations, with Siuda acting as the mediator. As the chants from the people grew louder all around them, the six men struggled to iron out a deal that left everyone happy, and the city intact.\n\n\"Well that's the point of an assembly,\" Siuda explained, running off of minimal sleep and diminishing hope, \"each person gets one vote. If you turnout, your vote will count, simple as that. There is no way to maintain a system of anarchism with parties.\" Debate erupted as the six men stumbled over top of each other to prove why the statement was true. Whatever they were trying to accomplish, it clearly wasn't working. Siuda massaged his temples intensely, trying to work out the migraine that grew and grew. The stomping of feet and constantly repeating chants made Siuda yearn for the Black Army to simply intervene, to create a path and let all six protest groups march as they chose and everyone could go home.\n\nThree hours had passed.\n\nBy then, the chants had died out, and now, the negotiations were more an exhibit, or rather, an inverted zoo. Six crowds, six beasts, stood around the seven humans and watched as they murmured and mumbled. Finally, one of them stepped back, resigning from the endurance test they had undertaken. Eight minutes later another did too, and one more, and two more, and then it was just Siuda and one other. \"You've made your point clear on politics, and it is apparent your mind will never change and your opinions won't budge. That's fine.\" said the last one standing. \"I cannot, though, allow your economic policies to drive this city, and Russia at large, into the ground. There must be some compromise here or there will be no choice but to organize a general strike.\" Siuda, exhausted and eager to return home, learned an important lesson,"

For that, he was commendable. His first mistake though, was trying to force an anarchist to abide by the rules.\n\nSiuda slipped out of his door and into the dead of night with nothing more than his fur coat wrapped around him. He wasn't even sure what he was hoping to find. A clue? Footprints? A giant neon sign pointing him towards the individual or group behind the attack? Any would've been nice. Instead, Siuda got the freezing rain, and pitch black city. This was stupid, he decided, come on! He turned on his heel, looking back to the trail he had made, and tried to fit his foot perfectly into the holes. When he couldn't fit into the first hole, he paid it no mind. When the second didn't, it was cause for suspicion. When Siuda looked up and saw that the footprints led the opposite way from which he came, he knew.\n\nSiuda crept to the outskirts of the city, towards the tall trees that the buses, those damn buses, had entered from. The footsteps led further north, and Siuda followed closely behind like a loyal dog. Without explanation, the footsteps stopped. There simply were holes, and then there were not. Siuda inched closer to investigate and as he did, he heard the most peculiar sound. The ground beneath him meowed.\n\nSiuda shook his head, clearly he had lost the plot, men didn't vanish leaving nothing but footsteps behind them, and the ground did not meow. Siuda shifted his weight to make his way back to his residence when he heard it again. A meow. Siuda furrowed his brow and looked all around him, but no source could be found. He stepped, and he heard it again. Siuda's eyes became wide with the realization; a cat could be buried in the snow! He began frantically wiping away at the thick layers of snow, until he found it."

Look, you'll believe me when you see this,\" Siuda bent down to the ground and brushed away the freshly fallen snow. Just beneath it, a wooden door, akin to one attached to a cellar, revealed itself. \"I haven't opened it, the people here have entrusted you all with this responsibility, and I do as well. Whoever killed those people is behind that door.\" The unlikely group exchanged glances once more, this time concern had shifted to fear and frustration to courage.\n\n\"Well,\" said Abakumov, gun grapsed tightly in his hand, \"unless you are planning on waiting for an invitation, I think it's time we put an end to this.\"\n\nIt was decided that Siuda, Taratuta, and Abakumov would go in alone, with the other members remaining outside to maintain the continuity of the committee should the worst befall them. The trio crept quietly through the door and into a rat's maze. A labyrinth of twisting tunnels spiraled out of every wall, forking and forking again. \"No shit...\" Abakumov muttered under his breath, \"these tunnels lead everywhere...\" The three stopped at the first tunnel, where a faint light illuminated the side of the wall.

The cat returned, and began to purr, rubbing his head against the pretender Vozhd's leg. He made some effort to shoo away the cat, but hesitated. Abakumov seized the opportunity, and twisted himself free from his captor. In one fluid motion, Taratuta retrieved her gun, aimed, and made the world a little bit better.\n\nThey stopped for a moment to catch their breath, and to process what happened.

Look,\" he pointed, \"That wasn't a fascist, that was second in command to Rodzaevsky.\" Taratuta and Siuda rounded the corner Abakumov had been snatched behind, and saw candles lit around a portrait of Rodzaevsky stacked on top of books of hate.\n\nSiuda, still shaken by the fact he was face to face with a mad man as he got off of the bus, as a refugee no less, shook his head, \"This tells me we have a long way to go before agents of hate are driven from Russia.\" Taratuta offered no words, reloading her gun silently."

Monarchists, hundreds of them, roaming the streets, their loyalties still rooted in the long dead name of a line that had once stained his homeland with grievous oppression. Less flabbergasted at such a thing however, was his trusted foreign minister.\n\n\"It's like I've gone backwards comrade, it really feels that way.\" Siuda commented rather bluntly, his eyes still wide in disbelief as he strolled between the desolate corridors of the Tsar's once populated palace, its halls decorated with ornate fixtures and portraits of royalty forgotten by time. His companion did nothing but chuckle, a smile curling up her face as she gestured forward to the grand chamber positioned before them.\n\n\"Oh, don't blabber too much, of course places like this still exist, Harbin was always a haven for these lot and their nostalgia,\" she playfully retorted, attempting to subdue his perplexed wonder and once more foster a focus toward their goal. \"You asked for a suitable place, no?

It was almost like it burned his eyes to look upon it, the shape a representation of all he had come to find despicable about the horrid conditions of Amur, and equally a symbol of those who had once ruled here. To call him mortified that the gigantic neon swastika was still standing, let along brimming with light that projected a harsh silhouetted glare upon the streets below, would be a dramatic understatement.\n\nHe had already decided what he wanted to do, turning to the man next to him, mumbling in shock and surprise, \"Why is that still here? I want it gone within the hour, or I'll blast it to pieces myself.\" Pyotr Siuda sneered, gesturing for the messenger to scurry off to the local garrison, hoping that they would arrange suitable methods to obliterate such a flagrant display of the scourge that had haunted Russia.\n\nIt was not less than thirty minutes when his message bore fruits, several men arriving, their faces hardened from the bitter siberian air. Instructions followed, charges set and a gathering amassed. In Siuda's mind doing this publicly and with definite purpose was the only way, showing the people of Amur that they were liberated, now more than ever, was his top priority. Nothing sent a message, like a few well placed explosives, and a whole lot of cheering.\n\nSatisfaction, that would now be the descriptor for his mood, a smile overtaking his dreary expression as the queasy spasms from his midsection faded into a deep content. The people seemed happy enough, their faces dotted with wide grins and exhilarated joy, some even on the verge of tears as the monument to their oppressor was cast off with a bang, only dust in the wind.\n\nHowever, some in the crowd didn't seem all that impressed, no, they seemed angry that they had dared defile the monument to the Vohzd and all he stood for. He could see them, weaving their way between the crowds as if just another batch of elated spectators, their expressions betraying their ill thought out disguise.

His men had been watching the cargo ship that had docked itself in one of Magadan's jetties. By a ramp leading to the deck of the ship itself, a pair of soldiers stood next to what Siuda could only assume was the Captain of the cargo ship.

Pyotr had done this many times before, but he couldn't remember the last time the crowd in a place like Kansk was so dour.\n\nIn the months since the liberation of Irkutsk, the city had undergone changes under the communes. Ripping out the ugly facets of Yagoda police state took time, and instability had grown rife as the local administration hammered out the kinks. Gripping the edge of the podium, Siuda cleared his throat and held his head high as he began to speak.\n\n\"Comrades of Irkutsk!\" Siuda's voice boomed. \"It has been some months since this city has been liberated from the clutches of the old Union's withering hands, and the Presidium toppled.

Now, more than ever, the future of Irkutsk looks ever brighter.\"\n\nSiuda's voice had all the charisma, the fiery quality that inspired rousing cheers all over the Angarsk river basin, but that day, it fell on deaf ears. As his eyes scanned the crowd, faces twisted into sneers, frowns - or worse yet, remained blank expressions, as if they weren't listening at all. Siuda gulped.\n\nPerhaps they were too used to Yagoda's iron fist - like cattle, or men in the cave who had seen only the shadows. Siuda could blame them, but something deep down within him, something etched behind those weary faces, told him that it wasn't their fault. As much as it turned his stomach to admit, Yagoda's regime brought security that the Black Army hadn't. Not yet - although, it would.\n\nEasing it back, Siuda felt his chest empty of breath.

Everyday, he woke up, and made his way to school.\"\n\n\"Mice don't go to school!\" One child cried, \"I've never seen a mouse go to school!\"\n\nTaratuta smiled through the interruption, only a child would see the need to correct a fantasy. \"Ah, but this is a world where they do!\" The response seemed to placate the child and Taratuta was free to continue. \"One day, while on the playground, Georgy had bumped into Fyodor, a huge dragon who used her size to bully all the other schoolchildren. 'Give me your lunch, little mouse!' Fyodor thundered. Georgy was scared! Fyodor could swallow him whole! Georgy reached into his backpack to hand over his lunch, when another student ran up beside him.\"\n\nTaratuta licked her finger, turning the still stuck together pages, \"A girl he knew from class ran to Georgy's side, 'Stop!' She said, 'Why does she deserve your lunch? That's yours!' The girl turned to Fyodor, standing at the foot of the dragon, 'Just because you're stronger, doesn't mean you get to push us around!' The scene had attracted the attention of many of the other schoolchildren who joined her, standing beside her. 'You may be able to pick on us alone, but together, we are stronger than you!'\" Taratuta gently closed the book, and smiled back at the children."

 SBA_PowerStruggle.25.desc: "It's never just one drink. As Stepan Valenteev and Pyotr Siuda sat idle, side by side at the bar, their conversation jumped from topic to topic sporadically. \"I swear!\" Siuda cackled, \"I'm being completely honest! She made a doll in my likeness, out of her own hair!\" Siuda put emphasis on the last words, exaggerating the absurdity of the statement. The typically stoic General Valenteev couldn't help but laugh. \"And, and, and,\" Siuda continued, \"She asked me if I liked it!\" Siuda made a face of disbelief, \"Do I like it?! So what do I do? Tell her no? That it's the most disgusting thing I've ever laid eyes on? I had to tell her I loved it! I still have it in my suitcase!\" The two shared a minute of pure, alcohol induced laughter.\n\nAs the laughing died down, Valenteev wiped at his eyes, \"Ah Comrade Siuda-\"\n\n\"Please, Pyotr would be enough.\"\n\n\"You know how to have fun, I have not had a chance to unwind like this since the last time we drank together. Your invitation tonight was thoroughly appreciated.\" Valenteev stood, stumbling only slightly, and pushed his stool against the bar.\n\nSiuda rose with him, grabbing his coat from the rack adjacent, \"Let me walk you to your vehicle.\" He insisted, \"There was one more thing I was hoping to discuss.\" As the two walked out of the bar and into the cold, outside world, reality set back in. They were not friends, or comrades, or simple war buddies, they were responsible for this land. Siuda turned to Valenteev, gripping tightly on his shoulder, \"Comrade. I'm afraid we won't have many more moments like this.\"\n\nValenteev, still under the influence, flashed a dopey smile, \"I would have to agree, we're almost to my car.\"\n\nSiuda offered back polite laughter, but the cold had largely sobered him up, \"No, that's not quite what I mean. You know Ivan is plotting something, I feel it. The protest in Tomsk, the attack on our convoy, hell, if he pulled the strings behind the strings behind the demonstrators in Irkutsk too! He's going to act soon, Comrade. I need to know if you're on my side.\""

His eyes darted between the map sprawled out across his desk and the blank page staring back at him. How long had he been there, eyes jumping between the two? It was dark out, but then again, days and weeks had likely passed during his three way staring contest. Siuda was probably already in the East, shaking hands, kissing babies, and performing miracles, as he always was. Stepanov sighed. He knew his flight left in the morning, knew that there was so much work to do, but yet it was far easier to pace. And so he did. He paced. And paced. And paced.\n\nStepanov woke up three hours before his departure, the blank page continuing to mock him. Damn it all! Stepanov looked to the window, and the purple hue of the sky told him morning was soon to come. Slowly, Stepanov rose from the office chair he had made his bed, and walked to the window. He stood, arms folded behind him, and looked over the not-yet awake city. This was his domain. This he could handle. But far off in the horizon were many more obstacles to overcome, adventures to see to completion, and legacy's to lay. Stepanov could not help from smiling, that's why he did it. His grin grew larger. Siuda did it for the ideology, but Stepanov, Stepanov did it for the chase. For the pressure, for the glory.\n\nIvan Stepanov sat at his desk in the transitionary period between day and night. Though time may be indecisive, he would be no longer. Stepanov gripped his pen tightly around his fingers, and let the words flow out of the end until the once blank page was a detailed description of troop deployments and orders during his absence in Siberia. Problem areas, such as Tomsk and the Mongolian communes, would require additional men in his absence. Stepanov adorned the newborn order with his signature, surely they could keep things in order until he returned from the East."

What would he have for lunch? Would he be home before his kids fell asleep? And as Igor made his usual commute to the factory, a foreboding feeling began to envelop him. The usual routines of his neighbors were not in full swing, not on display for all to see. There was no smell of morning cooking. There were no children preparing for school. There was no life in the outskirts of Tomsk. Yet, a ferocious beating came from the town square, contrasted sharply by a mellow orchestra. It was unusual.\n\nPyotr had left his home at an early hour, in the thickest clothes he had, and with the most unusual thoughts bouncing around his head. Who all would be there? What were the chants again? Who was D.S? And as Pyotr made his unusual commute to the city center, it only took him three blocks until the butt of a firearm made contact with his face.\n\nMihkail had stepped off the train into Tomsk in the dead of night. He and 399 of his companions were to make a home of the city, joining the two thousand men already stationed in the days prior, per the orders of the highest military authority in Siberia. And as the men began to set up shop in the city, a sense of dread, that of being watched, crept up and over him. As night turned to day, and residents of the city of art awoke to the arrival of military personnel, he was sure there would be chaos.\n\nDimitri Shostakovich had left his hovel which functioned as both a hideout and prison, in the early hours of the morning, scarf wrapped haphazardly around his neck. To Dimitri, the morning was routine. Go early, collect what was needed, and return 'home' for another day of drinking. However, as Dimitri hobbled past the train station, and saw the train car let loose a flood of countless soldiers pour over the city, his mind had been made. Without delay, the old man spread like a virus, waking up his old allies in the city that once was his home, and prepared them to take to the streets to let their voices be heard."

In truth, the anarchists had split themselves, and soon to be the entirety of the Free Territory in twine. A boundary had been established on each side of the barrack, nearly all 2,400 men taking up a side. On the left, ironically, stood those in concurrence with their orders. Opposite them, a big tent faction of those opposed to the deployment had taken shape. Words were their bullets, for now, and as arguments swelled, the tension continued to rise.\n\n\"You act like you don't know where we are!\" Struggled one voice against the crowd, \"This city is of artistic expression and cultural advancement, not war! I was there when Comrades Siuda and Stepanov marched down these same streets the protesters do, and I watched as-\"\n\n\"Jesus, shut the hell up!\" Retorted a voice from the other side, \"You want to speak so highly of the reactionaries? Go join them. We are here to maintain the peace, this demonstration only proves General Stepanov correct. While our comrades wipe out the last remnants of statism in the East, it is our duty to keep order here.\" Murmurs of agreement fought against the jeers of the Siudaists.\n\nAs the debate raged on, one man, a recent recruit to the Black Army, sat nervously by his radio. For hours, since the protests began, he had been desperately radioing out for someone to restore order. However, it became apparent that the Free Territory was nothing more than its biggest names. Without the leadership of Valenteev, the decisiveness of Mishurenko, nor the ideological conviction of Siuda, the Army was left directionless, and no amount of votes would iron the issue out. Mercifully, the radio crackled to life. After hours of trying, he was transferred to General Stepanov in his temporary eastern headquarters in Chita. \"Comrade General, this is Pavel-\"\n\n\"I don't care. You've made thirty attempts to reach me in the last hour. What is going on?\"\n\n\"Protests, they've protesting for-\" Somewhere behind him, glass shattered, and the voices of the two factions grew louder, \"Comrade General, the people want us out and some of the men here agree, dozens have already joined the protesters.

Through the receiver, he could hear it, the sound of all his plans unfolding. Damn it all. He thought back to the order, his final deployments made before he was due to depart for the East. If only he had worked a little harder, started a little sooner, planned even further ahead. The wave of possibilities crashed over him. With more vetting, he could've assured that his most loyal followers were in charge of the city. With more planning, he could've preempted any protests. With hindsight, things would be perfect.\n\n\"Comrade General?\" The two simple words saved Stepanov from falling deeper down the pit of what-if. Stepanov pulled at his face, mulling over the decision. He made his home out of the old Tsar's palace, and from the grand balcony, Stepanov looked out. It was new and lawless and untamed. But it would never be his if the core of his power base collapsed. So what was he to do? Concede to the first sign of resistance? But if he couldn't keep Tomsk in order, how could he keep the East under his boot? But if-\n\n\"Comrade General? Please advise.\"\n\nStepanov's eyes widened, right! There was no more time for indecisiveness. Stepanov took a deep breath, and through gritted teeth delivered the most difficult order, his second test. \"Listen carefully. My orders are clear. You say that factions have arisen? There will be a complete reorganization of command structure. Half of you will remain at the city's outskirts. I will radio for General Mishurenko to prepare accommodations. The other half, those sympathetic to the agitators, are reassigned to patrols along the border to our south. I will radio to General Chapayev to open up his headquarters in Tuva for your arrival.

 SBA_PowerStruggle.30.desc: "It started on the radio three decades ago. Dimitri Shostakovich; the best composer of his time! A visionary, a genius, a prodigy. Through those decades, those adjectives slipped into the background, kidnapped and replaced with new ones. A politician, a leader, a hero. Even then, he was not long for those titles either. As the anarchists of the Black Army moved north and into the city he had made his home since the fall of the Union, he became the antithesis of his younger self. A drunkard, a failure, a recluse. And for a time, it seemed as though those would be the last words to describe him. Passion fades, but talent doesn't. No matter what he did, Dimitri Shostakovich excelled in everything, even when he failed, he failed spectacularly, and he failed hopefully. Hopeful, even as Tomsk fell, that a new sun would rise over the city.\n\nIt started on the radio three hours ago. Stepanov's orders were clear. There would be no withdrawal, no capitulation to the protestors' demands for an end to the occupation. Soldiers exploded out of the building, two currents forking from one stem. One flowing to the side of the people and the protestors, and one to the opposite end of the city square. As men took their places for what would be the final symphony, and prepared for the crescendo, it was clear the winning side had already been predetermined. The protest was quickly organized, if it was even organized at all, and men, women, and children alike stood side by side with nothing more than their fists and their resolve and they knew they would lose. The soldiers, puppets of the scheming General, had lined up, prepared to carry out their orders, with reinforcements undoubtedly behind them. Dimitri Shostakovich watched, helpless, as his city split in two, for the third time in his life.\n\nAs David slayed Goliath, so too was the fragile peace slain by a single stone. Someone, from one side or the other, had let loose a rock, hurling it towards the other side. One rock became ten, and the voices of the soldiers grew louder, and the symphony hastily organized by the composer played louder to compensate, and anarchy ran wild like a river. As stones became bullets, Dimitri Shostakovich saw his city for the last time, in a fleeting glance, as sharp pain took root in his skull and spread outward like a virus. And as he lay dying, the music stopped, the chanting stopped."

Though his face remained still, maintaining that same posie and stoic grace he had determined to carry himself with, his heart fought with his brain. And more recently, his brain had been losing. He yearned for the west, but with each passing day, the vision of his home became a little more blurry. Each night he spent on the frontier of the warlord states to the west, he thought about crossing over, simply stepping out of the Free Territory, and back into Sevastopol, to Moscow, to Leningrad, to home.\n\nMishurenko was literally shook from his thoughts as a small hand grabbed tight to him from behind. The old general turned, face distorted into a scowl, and prepared to let loose a lecture on properly attracting the attention of one's superior. Before he could, however, Mishurenko took a moment to size up who he was dealing with. A scrawny boy, one of thousands just like him, with desperation in his eyes. Mishurenko never had a son, or maybe he did, it had become hard for him to remember even the most important of details. But the look in the boy's eyes told him something was gravely wrong.\n\n\"Comrade General!\" the boy cried, \"A fight!\" The boy bent over, hands resting on his knees, as he caught his breath. \"These two men, I don't know their names, I'm sorry, I- well I just ran over immediately, someone told me to, I don't know their name either, I'm sorry, but two of the recent recruits, just like me, they, they started fighting. One is from Kansk, I know that much, said his father met Siuda, I mean Comrade Siuda, I'm sorry, personally! Anyways, another, the other guy, said something about a lack of resolve, how his father had served with Comrade General Stepanov and-\"\n\nMishurenko raised his hand, bringing the frantic boy to silence. The night was quiet again, only the low wind indicating that the world continued to turn. The old general looked back west, towards all he fought for, and considered his situation carefully. He was well aware of the friction between the boy and Stepanov, but now, it was spreading to the Army. He would be damned if his work to return to home was stopped by petty politics. Mishurenko put a hand on the boy's shoulder, and looked him square in the eyes, \"Thank you. I will deal with things from here.\""

 SBA_PowerStruggle.32.desc: "\"To: General Ivan Stepanov\n\nAs the most senior elected officer in the Black Army, I have seen many people come and go. You will recall that I was one of the first to attach myself to this movement, and I have spent those years since wondering if I made the wrong decision. As we froze in the Assembly Hall in Kansk, decades ago now, I watched as you built a kingdom around yourself, a Tsardom in the anarchy. I took notice of your actions, admittedly first falling victim to your tricks. For some time, I believe you were just as committed to this as Pyotr.\n\nBut as we grew out, expanded from bandits to statesmen, I saw you for who you were. You are a general, not an ideologue. Perhaps I am reading you wrong once again, but I believe there comes a time where we have to show our true selves. Last night, a fight broke out between two of my inferiors, torn apart by the politics you and the boy preach. It was then it was clear to me that you have grand plans for Russia, plans far beyond visiting the Far East out of goodwill.\n\nAs a military officer myself, I am perhaps biased in my decision on which horse to bet on in this race, in this struggle for power, but I believe I can lend you some valuable advice. What you have done to the Army and to the people of Russia at large is appalling, and still, I believe the worst is yet to come. However, it is in your best interest to know that you command plenty of respect, and you do not need me to tell you how much power you wield, but will never match the boy in terms of public popularity. I have led countless campaigns all across the carcass of the Union, and I have not once met a man equal to Pyotr Siuda in charm, nor resolve. If this is a battle you intend to win, you must drop any pretenses of winning on the battlefield of words.\n\nRumors have begun to spread in your absence and in Siuda's. Your misguided decision regarding the city of Tomsk speaks to this point. There have been whispers of further rebellion in Kemerovo, though I am unable to substantiate them. Likewise, I have gotten word from a contact in the Amur region that Siuda is to make a stop there in the coming days. This would provide a perfect opportunity to remove the issue once and for all, simply rid yourself of the boy then and there. I cannot tell you which decision to make, but I will say, if you intend to govern as a strongman, you must act like one.\""

 SBA_PowerStruggle.33.desc: "Stepanov had read and re-read Mishurenko's letter over and over again. He paced, and read. As he laid in bed, he read. As he shook hands and laid the foundations of connections essential for a soon-to-be dictator, he repeated the letter again and again and again in his head. If he were to be a strongman, he'd need to act like one. The phrase echoed in his head, thrashing around wildly, denying him sleep, peace, and efficiency. As had become habit, after returning back to his temporary residence in the former Imperial Palace, Stepanov stood on the balcony, and looked out into the city, searching for the answer.\n\nHe hated himself. He had always been cool and composed, and a single letter had reduced him to an indecisive mess. Of course, that was only a persona, but he hoped that if he faked it hard enough, it would become him. That word had come to haunt him; indecisive. Everytime he thought he had successfully excised it from him, it came back. There were only so many times he could walk back and forth in his room, or lie wide awake in his bed, and push the issues out of his head. It became an attack on his pride. Mishurenko, the elderly and forgetful general, had the nerve to tell Stepanov what to do. Who does he think he is? Stepanov knew the answer to that question of course; he was someone who was right.\n\nStepanov looked to the east from the balcony, somewhere, Siuda was out there too. Instinctively, his hands had curled into fists. If he didn't do something, the boy would run Russia into the ground, leaving behind a legacy of weakness and rubble. There had been plenty of opportunities to kill the boy in the past, but none seemed right, everytime he hesitated, not out of friendship, but out of fear. Stepanov did not care for Siuda, but, in his heart of hearts, he was terribly afraid of him. The moment Stepanov became aware of that feeling, that Siuda could win, he knew what he had to do. The boy would die, and he would reign. He wasted no time in devising a plan, drafting a plan for his most dedicated and experienced men to await Siuda on the outskirts of his destination, while Stepanov returned to Central Siberia so as to provide himself an alibi."

The denazification project he had undertaken in what was once Rodzavesky's domain had been a resounding success, even if there had been one significant thorn in his side. Ahead of him, the vehicle carrying his personal guard bounced up and down against the terrain. To his rear, two other vehicles followed closely behind, one carrying Yevgeniya and other aides, and behind them the supply truck. Tired of being tired, Siuda leaned forward from the back seat, \"Comrade,\" Siuda addressed his driver, \"Are we still on track to be in the city before midnight? We had planned to set up shop overnight and get to work right away in the morning.\"\n\nHis driver nodded, \"Yes.\" Siuda smiled, a man of few words! He seemed to attract people like that, perhaps to compensate for his abundance of them. Content, Siuda leaned back in his seat, and let himself drift off to sleep, exhausted from his busy schedule.\n\nBefore his eyes opened, his head hurt. Siuda had found himself on the floor of the vehicle, sprawled out and face down. He could hear the engine roaring, and felt the sharp turns of the vehicle threaten to throw him around like a schoolyard ball. Gripping his seat tightly and pulling himself up, Siuda saw the earth move quickly around him. His brow furrowed as he looked out the windshield and saw no lights ahead of him. Siuda's brain began to race, almost matching the speed of the vehicle, was this a kidnapping? No, surely not, the two vehicles behind him would never allow it. Once more, Siuda leaned forward to the driver's seat, \"What are you doing?!\"\n\nEyes still focused on the road, the driver spoke calmly, \"The vehicle ahead of us was ambushed,\" The driver took his hands from the wheel to exaggerate his point, \"men swarmed out of the woods, they had rifles, like this.\" The driver mimed holding a firearm. \"We have to get you out of here.\" The driver returned his hands to the wheel and continued full speed ahead. Siuda leaned back in his seat for the second time, processing the situation. This wasn't a bandit attack, it was an assassation attempt. Although it was no secret many people wanted him dead, only one person had the resources to pull off an attack such as this one."

That would mean that in one hour and thirty-five minutes ago, it would be twenty four hours since Pyotr Siuda was killed. Stepanov took deep, long, breaths. This was a good thing, he told himself. This was the decision of a strong man. After the thousandth time, he almost started to believe it, and the anxiety he felt started to slip away.\n\nFrom his seat next to the window, Stepanov saw the expanse of Russia beneath him. Now, there was nothing in the way of his power play. He had already rehearsed his speech, that while working together with Siuda in the integration effort, a rogue member of the Russian Fascist Party attacked Siuda's vehicle, and Stepanov barely escaped with his life. The wheels turned in his head of just what would be his first move after taking Russia for himself. Dinner sounded nice.\n\nParanoid about his decision, Stepanov had demanded a report on the assassination as soon as it had been carried out. From the back of the plane came a soldier, a single sheet of paper in his hand. \"Comrade General,\" he saluted, \"I just got word from the men on the ground regarding your...\" the soldier cleared his throat, \"operation.\" The man presented the paper to Stepanov, who took it, and waved his hand so as to dismiss the soldier.\n\nStepanov hastily scanned over the document. Tracing the words with his finger as he read, Stepanov jumped between important words. Ambush. Siuda. Skirmish. Escape. Failure. Stepanov froze for a second on the final word, failure. Siuda had escaped unscathed, and more than likely clued into Stepanov's plans. Ivan tore the page in two and crumbled each half in his hands. He should've known there would be no easy solution for this problem. Assassins had failed him, but he wouldn't fail again. There was no other choice but to be a strong man now."

He was gullible, sure, he had fallen victim to a few pranks, but he wasn't stupid. The town didn't even look like a kingdom! It was shabby, there were no monuments to a king, there was no fanfare of a court, it just looked like the rest of Russia. \"You still don't believe me?\" Alexi asked, facing Ivan, \"You will. The warehouse we're heading towards is supposed to be filled to the brim with old stuff from the kingdom. Guns, uniforms with the crown on it. You'll see.\"\n\nWhen they finally arrived at the warehouse, the sun had begun to set. Their elected officer had organized the company into two groups to cover each half of the facility. To Alexi's chagrin, the two were paired together, and began to sift through the boxes. Finding nothing of substance, Ivan stood triumphantly. \"Told you. There's nothing here that proves there was ever a kingdom. I mean come on, you have to be a special type of stupid to thin-\"\n\nWithout warning, the warehouse had turned pitch black. Conversation died out immediately, and silence fell over them all. For a moment, Ivan was sure he had gone blind, but only a moment later, the lights sprang back to life. In the center of the building, armed guards stood in a circular formation around a man adorned by a great, flowing, fur coat. The tension in the air was palpable, as confused glances were shared by the Black Army soldiers. \"This is an illegal search,\" The man bellowed, \"and a clear violation of the people's rights. As such, a militia has surrounded the building to ensure the integrity of our belongings. All armed soldiers will depart from this area at once.\" Ivan turned to Alexi, eyes wide and fixated on the man he recognized as Prince Yuiry. The Prince's back was to Ivan, and the two were in such a spot that they were unseen by the guards. Ivan's breath became shaky, and he looked to his firearm. Something came over him, something he could not control. He wrapped his trembling hand around the gun, aimed,"

Then, he heard, one by ten, by hundreds, as the reality of the situation set in for them. The Prince, one of the last links to the Rurikid dynasty, joined his sister on that warehouse floor.\n\nAlexi pulled Ivan down onto the cold floor in an instant. Alexi's eyes were wild, and his voice was hushed but frantic, \"You shot him!\" He panted, \"You shot him!\" Alexi repeated the phrase over and over again, but Ivan could hardly hear it as the sound of gunfire rang out all around him. Ivan kept his eyes wide open, afraid that if he closed them again he would see the Prince again. Alexi grabbed his shoulders, still flat on his belly, \"You shot him, Ivan! Oh my God!\" They didn't need to look to know that a massacre was taking place, but Ivan could not help but poke his head up and over their hiding spot. He saw the door in which they entered, the door to the outside world where this assignment was boring only minutes ago. The Prince wasn't bluffing.

Multiple times, the sound of firearms ceased, only to begin again, this time more ferocious. Finally, though, it let up for good, but Ivan didn't stand. Alexi did, however, and wept."

He yelled in a whisper, \"Jesus! You were going to shoot him? Are you trying to get us all killed?\" Ivan struggled to find the words, stuttering out some sort of explanation that he was just trying to defuse the situation before it began, and he was only following training, and he had never been in combat before, and a million other excuses that clogged his throat.\n\nThe elected officer had stepped forwards, hands off his weapon, and begun to quietly converse with the Prince. \"We are just investigating a claim that this building is being used to house weapons and ammunition to bring down the Free Territory. We are fully within our rights, under clearance of the Security Council, to investigate and destroy pro-statist rebellions before they spring up.\" The officer stepped closer to the Prince, eliciting a reaction from his guard, \"If you, and the people of this city, have nothing to hide here, there is no reason to point weapons at us.\"\n\nThe Prince shook his head and responded sternly, \"You brought down this kingdom in the name of liberty and now you will trample on it for the possibility of safety?\" The Prince crossed his arms defiantly, \"The ultimatum is the same.\"\n\nAlexi turned to Ivan, \"See, I told you I wasn't lying, there really was a kingdom here.\" Alexi and Ivan watched as the officer and the prince exchanged remarks for what seemed like forever. Ivan had regained some of his composure but couldn't shake the feeling that he could've done something horrible. As they sat and waited, and waited, and waited, the soldiers on both sides grew more comfortable. Still on edge, but the slightest noise would not trigger a massacre. What they were all oblivious too was the growing number of civilians outside the warehouse. The Prince wasn't bluffing. By the time that the officer had stepped away from Yuiry, they had been outnumbered by the town's people and had no choice but to accept the Prince's demands. One by one, the soldiers filed out of the warehouse, empty handed, and marched out of Kemerovo in shame."

Without reason, or prior notice, one hundred soldiers marched into the city. Residents of Tomsk will be familiar with this story. Soldiers occupied a building, and when the community stood up against this blatant overreach and display of disregard for the values of anarchism, the Black Army stood in opposition to the people. Though the full story has not yet been discovered, it is speculated that the Army arrived, occupied, and opposed the people off a flimsy rumour of weapons smuggling. As we await further news ro trickle out of Kemerovo, we ought to take a step back and question why incidents such as these happen more and more frequently.\n\nWhile I think some have always been suspicious of the power of the military, those individuals have been vindicated as of late. I encourage you to recall your memory of the latest assembly meeting you attended. How many guards were there? Then, think of the meeting before that and ask yourself the same question. With Comrades Valenteev and Mishurenko on opposite sides of the Free Territory, and Siuda and Stepanov in the East, the Black Army has been left to babysit us while Mother Anarchy and her many grooms are out.\n\nThe skirmishes in Tomsk and Kemerovo prove one thing, even if the Black Army has turned its back on liberty, the people have not. This pressure must be applied continuously and universally, squashing all facets of authoritarianism where they arise. What will you do when hundreds of soldiers march into your town? Will you stand up, or will you sit idly by as freedom dies. This state dressed in all black can not masquerade itself as an anarchist society. Question why, because for every troop deployment, or reshuffling of divisions, there is someone making that decision.\""

To Pavel, a peasant boy born to farmers in the Angra Basin, it was a dream, a place as real as Moscow, only alive in the past. As the hulking metal doors slammed shut behind him, Pavel awoke from his dream. The Imperial Palace was not a home, or anything like that now. Now, the palace was a graveyard. Empty. Save for the two last occupants. A peasant and a pretender.\n\nBehind him, Pavel could still hear the cheers and the echoing boom of the comrade General's speech, and could still smell the ash of looted artwork, propaganda leaflets, and bodies burned. The view in front of him wasn't much better. The body of a man, crumpled and discarded like worthless scraps of paper, lied contorted on the ground, the remains of his glasses dangling from his face. If it were not for the subtle rises and falls in his chest, the man would be indistinguishable from a corpse. Pavel offered the man a sad smile. It was disturbing, but it was right, right? That's what he was supposed to see, he was a soldier, an anarchist!\n\n\"A peasant.\" The soft voice from the man below him brought Pavel out of his trance. \"They've sent a peasant to dispatch me.\" The man laughed, a laugh that quickly devolved into a cough, and then to a weeze. Pavel watched in silence as the heap of a man began to take shape, and rose to his knees. The two met eyes. \"Aren't you? You are not noble. You are a boy.\"\n\nPavel took a deep breath, and felt his hand drift towards his side arm. He was right. He was just a boy.\n\n\"What have I done to deserve this? To die on my knees to a peasant? The rest were executed before the people, backdropped by roaring speeches and displays of military force!\" The pretnder's words echoed out throughout the hollow building, prompting Pavel to draw his weapon and plant it against his prisoner's forehead as instructed, \"This is not justice, nor liberty. You will soon find out that you are on the side of tyranny.\""

The engine, once dead, sprang to life, and light emerged from the front of the truck, the only light to be found. The brief illumination offered Stepanov a chance to truly observe his surroundings; snow, trees, and snow and trees. The only sign of civilization came from the dilapidated hovel before him. Incredible, he scoffed, what special breed of idiot would fight for this? The press of rubber against snow became audible as the light emanating from behind ceased to be. Stepanov took a deep breath, surely taking in more frost than oxygen, and adjusted his cap. This had better be worth it.\n\nBefore he could even reach the entrance, the door swung open, and out hobbled an elderly man, clearly missing an eye and certainly missing brain cells. \"General!\" The man spoke with reverence, despite the two never having met, \"It's an honor to host you, please, come in.\" The old man turned on his heel and marched back into his Siberian shack, with Stepanov a safe distance behind. Immediately, the familiar stench of mildew crashed over him like a wave. It didn't take long for him to find the source; scattered all across the floor were folders, documents, and loose papers. Though the bureaucrat in Stepanov cringed at the organization of what could only be critical information, his intrigue trumped his compulsivity as his eyes drifted past the swastika stamped atop each one.\n\n\"Don't want to be seen out of the city with those!\" The old man teased, \"Even then, word is your friend intends to visit Rodzaevsk.\"\n\nStepanov scowled at the very notion he would ever befriend the bumbling moron espousing his nonsense. \"Indeed. I'm sure you are less than enthusiastic about that. I don't imagine he's there to erect a memorial to the late Vozhd.\"\n\nThe old man flashed a devilish grin and let loose a hearty laugh. \"Just as enthusiastic as you are, General!\" The old man plopped into a wooden chair, hardly able to support his weight, and gestured for Stepanov to do the same. \"Scattered around you is my life's work, every single document regarding the Russian Fascist Party, it's members, operations, invaluable information for someone seeking to set up shop in this neck of the woods.\"\n\nStepanov gestured his hands outward, \"So you said in your letter. I hardly believe this is a gift of goodwill from a fascist to a man such as myself. What's your catch?\"\n\n\"What do you think?

Sure, foreign goods made the city more liveable than most, but what was a pile of shit to a heap?

He had come to accept this, even as his old comrades faded away beneath the boot of a new regime, a new face to sway the hand and call the people into the fervor of endless revolt.\n\nOf course he had seen this all before, endless nights had been spent crouched inside musty offices, small talk absent beneath the flowing waves of the commonality they had all shared, revolution. To Mikhail Chernov, his sworn lifelong commitment to the protection of the revolution and all that accompanied it was the burning fire in his soul, a flame that kept the frigid cold of a bitter reality from seeping into his very person.\n\nThis shell shattered suddenly, a thunderous knock from his door shattering the relative silence of his domicile, muffled rasps echoing from just beyond the battered entrance as the dreams of past crumbled into a dreadful present. His nostalgia dissolved into a bubbling pit of despair and panic, sweat forming beneath his brow as the sweltering heat inside him screamed into a roaring flame of regret. Panic turned to action, and the vanguard stood from his desk, pausing as he considered rifling through its drawer in search of something to defend himself with.\n\nMoving forward, Chernov seemed to almost stumble across the ragged wooden floorboards, the incessant creaks of wood stricken with rot filling the room as his hand trembled ever onward towards the doorknob. Palm slick with sweat, he fumbled attempting to turn it, eventually sticking his grasp upon the brass and curling his wrist downward, letting the door slam inward at his side.\n\nAnd instead of the flash of a handgun, like the former operative had expected, a letter was extended up to his face, its pale white hue dotted with an almost obnoxious red seal."

How does Siuda do it? Always chipper, optimistic, and quick to unleash a tirade of horseshit.

The song of the forest grew louder and louder as Pyotr's grin grew larger and larger.\n\nThe song stopped. The great celestial body watching over him blinked out of existence. The forest was now black. It was more than black, it was a void. It wasn't simply a room with dull light, it was the destroyer of light. Pyotr's laughing trailed off as the cold impacted him once more. For years, Pyotr stood in the destroyer of light. Without warning, the trees ignited into flame. Pyotr began to scream, he began to claw at his skin. It was so hot! Too hot! It's hot! Pyotr began to melt, his skin pooling at the ground. It's hot. it's hot. Hot hot.\n\nFrom the ashen corpse of the woods, a single tree grew and on its lone branch dangled a body. Fat and round, the body shook amongst the flicking flames. \"Pyotr,\" The corpse thundered, \"You child. Look what you have brought to this forest. Teeming with life. Now look! LOOK!\" Pyotr had no eyes to look but he saw.\n\nPyotr jerked himself upright in his bed, panting heavily. He looked around his room, as it was before he closed his eyes. He began to laugh, it was only a dream! His giggle turned into a laugh and his laugh into a sob."

You aren't him.\" The phrase struck a chord with Pyotr, his face twitching slightly.\n\n\"Thank you, Comrade Taratuta.\" Pyotr pulled the coat tighter around himself as he moved for the door to the balcony. Pyotr gripped the doorknob, before he even stepped out, Pyotr could hear their cheers. They sung his name, demanding to see Comrade Siuda, defender of the revolution against the snake general, Stepanov. Pyotr took in a deep breath, turned the knob, and stepped out into the brisk morning air.\n\nPyotr nodded politely as he waited for the roaring applause to end. It felt different. This was the treatment fascists received and Tsars envied. Why was he here? The answer was in the admiration of the people below him. They chose him. They trusted him. Pyotr was not to let them down.\n\n\"Comrades!\" He called, \"Today we pass the second test! With our combined might, we toppled the authoritarian states of Siberia! We have left them battered and bruised, yet, we must remain vigilant. It is time to build our own anarchy, free from the state inside and out of our territory!\" Pyotr found his footing, continuing to rally the people to his side as he laid out the core message of the anarchist movement.

Misha soldiered on a few more meters before arriving on the wooden porch. Be nice, he thought, guy hasn't done anything to you. Misha knocked on the door, not too gentle, not too hard. He pressed his ear against the door to hear if someone was coming. Not a sound. Well fuck, wrong again. Guess he dragged himself out to the outskirts of Tomsk for no reason. Misha turned to leave, but it was then he saw it, the curtain of one of the windows quickly pulled shut. Misha knocked again, \"Hey! I know you're in there! I can see you!\" No response. Misha sighed, he didn't bring himself out here to play hide and seek. Misha turned the knob and stepped inside.\n\nInside, the scene looked like something after the detonation of an atom bomb. Papers scattered all over the floor, books with pages ripped out, and large chalkboards with unintelligible scribbles. Misha precariously stepped over the clutter, \"I'm with Comrade Taratuta's agency. I just have a few questions- HEY!\" From the far the side of the room, Misha could see a suited man partially hanging out of the window.\n\nThe man scrambled to squeeze out of the window but his briefcase was caught on the sill. Misha rushed over and grabbed the man, yanking him back inside."

 SBA_LibSoc.22.desc: "Siuda had no issue with providing funding to the scientists. After all, they were building a nuclear bomb - that clearly required a lot of resources - and Siuda was a firm believer in the high ideals of science. The General Assembly, not so much. Most of the representatives, while receiving a basic education from their respective communes in administration and representation, were not educated in nuclear physics and the exact resources required to build a nuclear bomb. So when presented with a full list of the funding and resources needed, multiple representatives jeered on and yelled for the timid scientist to get off stage.\n\nA vote must be held in the end, though. Two motions had been proposed: provide the scientists with all the resources they needed, and hopefully see a bomb done better and quicker, or give them partial funding and resources. This would still likely see a bomb, but researchers are obviously not happy about not giving free rein for what is a priority in Siberia."

Even if it was just some assembly in Siberia, their job, their life, was for the betterment of all men.\n\nThe excited murmur in the hall dimmed to a whisper as Pyotr took the stage. Pulling the old microphone closer to his lips and straightening his posture, he began to speak to the hundreds gathered. Pyotr was never an orator - his voice was uncertain, and his cadence stilted - but all of them huddled in the hall understood him, and that was what mattered.\n\n\"I was in my bedroom last night, lying awake, and wondering to myself: how does anarchy survive? Truly survive? It is not merely by spirit alone. If that was true, then what of the countless oppressed who yearn for the spirit of anarchy? What of the theoreticians and philosophers, who wrote book upon book on the ideal? It seems to be clear that men must die for anarchy. For freedom. Whether it is statists and fascists, or anarchists themselves, it seems that we must kill the vanguards of a state to achieve lasting anarchy. And I was considering this unfortunate conclusion when I realized it was not from the loins of death that anarchy emerges, but from the fear of death. When the statists fear catastrophe, they will leave us to our own devices. When the statists fear the ultimate destruction - nuclear hellfire - they will leave us to our freedom.

And the whole town just took it like they'd never grown anything in their lives. One officer, in the middle of handing out some bread to some children, spotted Leonid watching. The soldier shot him a flawless smile and waved to Leonid. The old man wasn't going to sit and watch as his town's soul was ripped from its heart.\n\n\"You goddamn Reds aren't going to take away our freedom! Now you think you can win our hearts, huh?

There wasn't a council building - the hamlet was small enough where disputes and major settlements were just settled by a large meeting and a few hours of discussion, along with breaking bread and the usual shots of vodka. The snowpack had meant that the doors were shut tight, and half a day of digging by hand was required just to clear the way. Much of the town slipped through, huddled together, and began discussing the issue of the day.\n\nThe harvest had been poor that fall, and some families up north didn't have enough food to last the winter. A larger farm to the south of the hamlet was saving food for any Black Army patrols that passed through the town, but after realizing how dire the situation was decided to set aside most of it for the family.\n\nThe exact deal was hashed out, handshakes were made, and everybody got plenty drunk. After all, the night was cold and the vodka was warm. It began to feel like a party. Someone even brought a balalaika, and just as everybody began to dance, a shot rang out. Not a mile out, some hunter far from the forest, but in the barn. A man held the gun above his head, and as everyone figured out who exactly shot it, they finally realized who that new citizen was. Not a citizen - not even a local. By the accent he drunkenly spoke in, he was from Novosibirsk. To frightened ears, he was able to slur out a few words.\n\n\"No-one will be, ah - sharing food - without express permission from the Black Army. That is the end of it, you rural slops.\"\n\nHe grabbed the bottle of Vodka and left the barn, departing on a horse. The rest of the citizens stood in shock.

It was designed for a man. They came bearing a slip of paper, printed in a shaky black script that practically smelled like the despair of Novosibirsk. That was, if it hadn't been rolled into a cigarette yet. Each one had memorized the message by heart.\n\n\"Bring your leaders to Novosibirsk.

Instead of arguing for further economic measures, they argued for political freedom. It was the first time they had to do so, being given total freedom before Stepanov came to power. Now, all across Siberia, theft took place and freedoms were curtailed. In the north, valuable timber was floated down the river for firewood on the front. Horses and tractors were seized; they were needed for efforts \"to develop the region\". The best wheat in the south was taken in the south for soldier's rations. Some outspoken communal leaders began to disappear. It seemed that all that the Black Army had been founded on was gone in a scant few months. Freedom was no longer free.\n\nThat is not to say that the Black Army was about to fire on a group of peaceful protestors. Stepanov was statist, not stupid. For now, he could watch as resistance simply faded out and the Black Army began to show the people what freedom really cost. No longer could they sit idly and fail to contribute to freeing Russia.

Put your name on the paper and hand it to the poor sap who has to inform his commune that they will not be receiving any additional reallocations. However, what set him apart from the average pencil pusher was that while some men lamented the very concept of currency, Kilichakov found solace in it. He enjoyed his job, something Stepanov was very much aware of.\n\nExiting his office out into the brisk Novosibirsk air, Kilichakov was greeted by the leader of anarchy, Ivan Stepanov. \"How do you do, Mikhail?\" Stepanov said with a grunt, rising from the bench he was sitting on. \"Why don't you join me for a walk?\"\n\n\"You know, Mikhail,\" Stepanov said as they strolled around the block, \"I don't know how numbers work.

The cigarette wasn't locally produced, not out of one of those shitty tobacco farms outside of the city. This was a real American smoke, Virginia made. When he inhaled the smoke, for just a fleeting moment, he doubted that communes could never be successful. After all, if some capitalist plantations in Virginia could make this, what did that say about a few Russian nitwits toiling in a \"workplace democracy?\"\n\nThis thought was interrupted by the ring of his telephone (not such a luxury, an old Red Army telephone.) Picking up the telephone, Stepanov heard an unfamiliar voice, in an accent from Moscow. Probably fled after the war. He spoke with a quiver in his voice.\n\n\"Sir, I speak on behalf of Marshal Valenteev. The marshal kindly requests you stand down and cooperate in the restoration of Anarchy.\"\n\nStepanov considered his options. Either he was to give in and perhaps lose his life in a Siberian prison, or he was to stand in defiance of Valenteev. And if he stood in defiance, who knew what lay in store? So he picked up the phone and stood in defiance.\n\nVelenteev heard the phone ring and his heart skipped. Could this be it? The moment where for once, they won? They could stop fighting and pushing and rest. Rest, for once, no more stressing about statism or despots or death in the name of life. Just rest. He picked up the phone and his heart skipped again.\n\nHe wasn't prepared for this response. He hadn't thought he would be called on his bluff. He didn't have the men, the money, to fight a war.

He looked at his notes, a long speech decrying Pyotr, pointing out his many failures and general lack of intelligence. Claiming his 'disappearance' was that overzealous child's own fault. But that wasn't Stepanov's style, it never had been. \"Comrades.\" Stepanov grinned as that hated term caused a sea of disgust among those in the Assembly \"I don't have to answer for the tragic fate of comrade Pyotr. Because as of this moment, this Assembly is disbanded.\" He pressed a button hidden underneath the podium.\n\n\"Comrade Stepanov, what is this statist madness?\" An assemblyman asked right before dozens of members of the Black Army poured into the room.

Color bled over lines, figures in the background were hardly more than black smudges. It was crude, but nevertheless a propaganda poster. What it depicted was strange. In the center was a man on his knees, bowing his head forward. The tattered cavalryman's uniform and wide handlebar mustache revealed the man's identity; Semyon Budyonny, that Bolshevik killed during the charge on Bratsk. With a sword to his throat was another man whose face wasn't revealed, but he had the build of a typical Black Army soldier. Squinting at the details, Fyodor could not make out the man's identity.\n\nFyodor has been there, at the charge. The high water of the Black Army's fight against the Bolsheviks to the east. Firing his old bolt-action at those horses. Budyonny headed the charge, and he was thrown off his horse when a stray bullet hit the brute's torso. As the Black Army beat off the Reds. At the end of it all, Siuda shot Budyonny in the head. The news carried throughout the region. The devil of Bratsk was dead. Why then, Pyodor thought, was some anonymous soldier executing Budyonny, and not Pyotr? It took a moment, but it dawned on Pyodor. Stepanov, that old bastard, wasn't trying to trumpet Pyotr's achievements. He was trying to trumpet the Black Army's. No better than Bukharin."

 SBA_Despotist.23.t: "Have You Heard About Them?"
 SBA_Despotist.23.desc: "\"Put Mishurenko on the line.\" Ivan Stepanov barked the orders from his bed, impatiently waiting for whatever idiot was working in Mishurenko's office that day to patch him through. He looked up to the tremendous, white marble, ceiling of his bedroom. He had it recently renovated at the expense of Kilchichakov. The leech he was, the way money disappeared from the budget in his presence would impress Stepanov if it weren't so tedious.\n\n\"Comrade Stepanov, this is Androniy Mishurenko.\" Stepanov could hear the spit flying out of his mouth. How on Earth did he ever end up with this man as his most trusted advisor?\n\n\"Is Yevgeniya with you? She mentioned she would be stopping by your office. Something about a-\"\n\n\"The terrorist attack in Kansk? Yes I am familiar.\"\n\nStepanov was taken aback. When did Mishuernko grow a pair of balls? He resisted the urge to tear him a new asshole, business came first. \"Is she down there or not?\"\n\n\"No. She never came by.\" Silence. \"Comrade Stepanov, have you heard about them?\"\n\nThe line pushed him over the edge, \"Cut the cryptic bullshit, dear god. I thought I had the last of that with Siuda, for fuck's sake.\" Silence once more. Stepanov bit his lip, he did really want to know... \"Tell me what's going on, Androniy. Do I need to come to Kansk?\""

 SBA_Despotist.24.t: "The Opposite of Love"
 SBA_Despotist.24.desc: "Andrey groaned as he lay down in his bed, his body aching from his latest confrontation. Some local factory workers had decided to vandalize Andrey's home, and later had cornered him and beat him bloody. Maksim was still working his shift in the munitions factory, and Andrey hoped he wouldn't get too worried when he saw him. Maksim had it hard enough normally, Andrey didn't want to put even more of a burden on him. He had even gone through the trouble to clean the paint off the door, even if he was so sore the old lady next door had to help him carry the water.\n\nAndrey remembered a time when this kind of thing wouldn't happen. Sure, things weren't perfect, but if things got bad you could go to some soldiers and get the bigots to at least apologize. When he was getting beaten, he was pretty sure he recognized one of the soldiers he had notified amongst the thugs. Maybe it was the head trauma, but Andrey couldn't remember when things changed. The shift in attitude happened after the Security Council took charge, but they had been some of the proponents of the protections, right?\n\nAndrey sighed. Just a few more days and he'd go back to his unit, who were more accepting. Andrey, ironically, was the lucky one, even if he didn't particularly feel like it right now."

 SBA.85.t: "Little Fires Burn Brightest"
 SBA.85.desc: "Bright Orange, that's the color of love. Some would tell you it's a dark, passionate red, others would tell you it's a deep blue to rival the darkest trenches of the ocean. Love is not a rainbow of colors built from the years spent, learning, crying their eyes out, and screaming at the top of their lungs. Love is not a collection of experiences. Love is a spark, a wild and angry creature that thrashes around in a persons heart the moment they see someone. THE one. In that intense moment of first meeting, the brain is hijacked, all senses thrown to the wayside. Who needs the senses anyways?\n\nLove is pain. A battered and broken creature that has suffered too long inside your stomach. It yearns for freedom, for a miracle, to escape from its cage. Yet it remains dormant and docile, love.\n\nLove is a broken promise. A jealous and bitter creature tired of putting up with non-existent bullshit. It rips open its chest and pulls out its beating heart and demands its partner shatter it to the ground and turn away as its pieces scatter into the wind.\n\nLove is forgiveness. A remorseful and pitiful creature which clogs up the organs of the body with sorries, pushing them up the throat with all their might.\n\nLove is in an instant. A moment of connection between two people that sets them on the course for the rest of their lives. They might think they know love, but one doesn't feel it until the moment it makes itself known."

 SBA_second_martial_tribunals_desc:0 "自由地区が拡大するにつれ、黒衛軍も成功により、多くの理想を持つ若者が地域の徴兵所に集まるようになり、拡大していっている。彼らは、戦って故郷を守ることを期待しており、我々もそれには答えるつもりだ。まあ彼らの想像通りでは無いだろうが。彼らは銃でなく、言葉で戦うであろう。そして、犯罪者から故郷を守るであろう。誰が刑務所に入るべきかや、誰が始末されるべきかを決めることによって。"

 SBA_expansion_seize_their_hoarded_riches_desc:0 "金持ちは権力の座にいる時間を享楽してきた。もう何年もの間、彼らは復讐を恐れずに、人々を思いのままにし、虐げ、搾取してきたのだ。\n\nこれ以上そうはさせない。人々が力を持ちつつある今、立場は逆転し、寄生虫や暴君どもは打ち倒されたのだ。盗まれた富は正しい持ち主へ返されたのだ。そう、シベリアの自由人にである。\n\n安全保障委員会は、中央シベリア全土で差し押さえを実行するために、黒衛軍を組織し、指示する―寄生虫どもにも、生き残れるのに十分な量は残してやろう。これが終われば、評議会は財産の適切な分配方法を決定するだろう。そして、すぐに自由地区の全人民の平等が達成されるであろう。"
 SBA_expansion_increase_local_cooperation_desc:0 "ロシアの国家統制主義者どもは、無政府主義という言葉は、混沌、死、そして破壊といった言葉と同義だと思っている。これは、真実から程遠い。実際に、無政府主義は国家が最も恐れているものであるが、社会全体を破壊して、制御不能にすることを意味していない。単に、支配がないだけだ。前政体の習慣に慣れているため、シベリアの左翼は我々に協力することに用心深い。しかし、我々の真の価値観とポリシーを簡単に説明すれば、すぐに仲間になってくれるだろう。"
 SBA_expansion_revolutionary_security_administration_desc:0 "あらゆる街角にネズミは潜んでいる。第五列が、工作員が、テロリストが、暗闇に隠れているのだ。彼らは一般人に対し、ブルジョワの意志を行使している。最近解放されたばかりのあらゆる場所で、大多数の人々が我々の戦う理由を知らないか、我々に対し、熱心に反発しているのだ。平和を維持し、滞り無く移行処置を行うために、そういった場所を軍事地区として管理することで、黒衛軍は扇動者を監視する。"
 SBA_expansion_to_defend_freedom_desc:0 "自由地区は、人々が真の自由の下で暮らせるロシアで唯一の場所である。この現実が、多くの人々に十分理解されていないという恐れがある。彼らは、我々を囲む軍閥が、我々の社会を引き裂き、全体主義的な政府を強要しようとしていることに気づいていないのだ。\n\n我々は自己満足に陥ってはならない。我々は無関心を受け入れることはできない。\n\n貴重な自由のために働き、そして守るため、評議会の命令で、安全保障委員会は自由地区の総動員を組織する。工場は生きるために轟音を立て、有志は工場に殺到し、領土全体の市民軍が、我々を打ち負かそうとする奴らを撃退する軍として組織されるだろう。"
 SBA_expansion_readying_the_black_army_desc:0 "国境に敵が集まり、戦争の準備が進みつつあるようだ。我々も、同じようにして応答せねばならない。黒衛軍は自由地区と我々を破壊すること目論む侵略者達の間にある唯一の壁だ。彼らは我々の守護者であり、圧政への防波堤だ。しかし、防波堤が虚弱であれば、接触するだけで壊れてしまうだろう。\n\nこのようなことが起こってはならない。\n\nこうなる運命を確実に避けるため、黒衛軍へのより多くの供給の割当が必要だ。食料、装備、物資、自由地区を守るのに必要なあらゆる物が黒衛軍に与えられるだろう。人々は、少しの間犠牲に耐えなければならないかもしれないが、これらの処置は黒衛軍の来たるべき戦争への準備としてだけでなく、勝利を確実にするために必要なのだ。"
