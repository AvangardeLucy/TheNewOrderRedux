 POLITICS_GENRIKH_YAGODA_DESC: "かつての旧ソビエト連邦時代、ゲンリフ・グリゴリエヴィチ・ヤゴーダの名は多くに知られ、恐れられていた。NKVD長官のヤゴーダはブハーリン政権の安定と治安強化を一手に担い、更には政権初期の権力闘争を支え、それを足がかりに権力を増大させていった。ヤゴーダからの簡潔極まりない命令は、最上位のボリシェヴィキたちをも失意のどん底に叩き落し、命令を受け取った者は反革命罪で処刑された。\n\nそして戦争が始まった。モスクワを含む連邦の大部分がドイツの軍靴に下った。混乱が進む中、ヤゴーダは自身の権限を振るい、ソビエト最高幹部会の大部分を引き連れて、ライヒより精一杯離れた土地、東に避難した。こうしてヤゴーダはシベリア奥地の支配を確立した。ここでの彼は、ソビエト後継国の中でも最大級の国を統治した。\n\nだがしかし、旧最高幹部会が樹立した国は長続きしなかった。ハルビンの唾棄すべき反動が、中央シベリアの「民主派」と取り巻きの将軍が、バイカル湖向かいの反逆的修正主義者が。敵や裏切り者が独立を繰り返し、ヤゴーダの帝国はゆっくりと崩壊していった。だがイルクーツク政府はあらゆる痛打に耐え抜き、一介の軍閥国家として今でも存続している。それでも、旧政権からの直接的継承を主張できるという、イルクーツク政権だけの正当性は砕け散ってしまった。今のヤゴーダは、NKVDが支配する革命最後の根拠地を支配し、一握りのボリシェヴィキ政治家たちを支配するのみだ。ヤゴーダに残ったのはこれだけだが、それが分相応というものだろう。"

 IRK_mutiny_in_the_trenches_desc: "連邦軍の兵士たちは想像を全する事態に堪えてきたが、これから彼らにはさらなる耐性を求めなければならない。彼らは、ドイツが何年も前に始めたことを完遂させようとしている裏切り者、パルチザンたちに対抗する我々の盾なのだ。連邦が生き残るためには、我々の目的のため最前線で体を張る男たちのために、できる限りの支援をしなければならない。\n\n食料や装備、武器を兵士たちに確実に届けることで、シベリア戦線の地獄のような状況に少しでも耐えられるようにするのだ。また、前線勤務と予備役を繰り返させることで、いざ戦場に召集されたときにより効果的に戦えるようにする。新たな脅威を前にして、士気を低下させているわけにはいかない。"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_defense_desc: "パルチザンの反乱は容赦なく、躊躇なく、速やかに鎮圧されなければならない。ヤゴーダは防衛省に対し、東での反乱が完全に鎮圧されるまでは、直ちに戦時体制に移行するように命じた。経済の特定分野では生産を軍需へとシフトし、他の分野では生産を継続するが、その方法を変更する。軍用食糧は一時的に民間の食糧供給より優先され、現在民生品を生産しているいくつかの工場は武器鋳造工場に転換され始めるだろう。\n\nまた、国防省は「前世紀の遺物」の支給を命じられた。これらの兵器は第二次世界大戦以前にさかのぼり、これまで倉庫に保管されていたものである。国防省はこれらの兵器を、自国内で活動するパルチザンの駆逐を目的としている予備部隊に支給する。"

 IRK_mutiny_nkvd_guards_detachments_desc: "連邦の暗黒の時代に、幹部会を救い出してイルクーツクに退避させたのがNKVDであった。今、我々は生き残るために再び戦うことを強いられているが、NKVDは再び我々に勝利をもたらすであろう。我が国のもっとも経験豊かな兵士の一部はNKVDのメンバーである。現在彼らは全国に散らばっており、衛兵から諜報員、秘密警察の一員として活躍しているが、彼らを集めて完全な軍の部隊として組織すれば、より大きな力を発揮することができるだろう。\n\nこの新たなNKVD自動車化狙撃師団は、裏切り者を串刺しにする槍の先鋒となる。ソ連の優秀な兵士たちの規律と冷酷さを前にすれば、ゴロツキどもに勝ち目はない。パルチザンを撃退したのち、この新たな師団はシベリア、ひいては全ロシアの奪還に役立つことだろう。"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_construction_desc: "イルクーツクは東シベリアの経済・産業の中心地だが、反乱で傷つけられている。軍事産業やインフラの大部分は、我々が最も必要としている時に、サブリンの盗賊の支配下に置かれてしまった。これを補うため、建設総局は我が軍のために多少の便宜を図らなければならない。\n\n他のプロジェクトに使われるはずの工場のスペースは、軍需生産のために確保されている。また、民間の建設が無期限に延期される一方で、軍に有益なインフラ開発計画が加速されている。奪われた産業が回復するまで、残されたものからすべてを吸い出さなければならない。どんな犠牲を払ってでも軍隊には供給を続け、機能させ続けなければならない。"
 IRK_mutiny_field_fortification_planning_desc: "野戦要塞計画"
 IRK_mutiny_supplemental_labor_battalions_desc: "サブリン派を倒すには、かつて我々を見捨てた者と手を組んででも総力を挙げる必要がある。我が国の収容所には、贖罪を証明し、自由を得るか少なくとも減刑されることを熱望する身体能力の高い囚人を大勢捕らえている。収容所からの志願者で編成された労働大隊を作成し、彼らには反乱の期間中、軍の技術者を補佐し、現場の建設を支援させることになるだろう。\n\nもちろん、これらの志願兵には注意を払わなければならない。彼らの多くは以前にも我々を裏切ろうとしており、反乱軍のプロパガンダに触れることで、簡単に再び裏切る可能性がある。忠誠心を高めるため、何事もなく任務を終えた志願者には、ささやかながら減刑の報奨を与えることにする。我々が一番避けたいのは、我々の前線で囚人が大量に反乱を起こすことだ。"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_capital_desc: "サブリンの反乱は、中央政府の重要な弱点を露呈した。国家機関が彼らを駆逐することなく、彼らがここまで大義を推し進めることができたのは、茶番としか言いようがない。このような事態を招いた政府の穴を確実に塞ぐために、早急に措置を講じなければならない。\n\nパルチザンを鎮圧した後、政府は彼らが奪った領土を速やかに再統合し、残った反対派を取り締まる準備を整えなければならない。また、このような反乱をなぜ見逃したのか、政府の見直しも必要だ。このような事態は二度と許されない、さもなくば連邦は生き残れないだろう。"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_presidium_desc: "我々の国家機構に必要な改革は、ソビエト連邦の幹部会が担当することになるだろう。この困難な時代において、幹部会は嵐を切り抜けるための安定した道標としての役割を果たすことができる。軍とNKVDが反乱鎮圧の諸問題を処理している間、幹部会の政治家は可能な限り平静が維持されるように努めるだろう。\n\n幹部会そのものについても、内外からの調査が行われなければならない。もし政府内に裏切り者が潜んでいるのであれば、それを炙り出さなければならない。だがそれ以上に重要なのは、反乱軍のリーダーが陰謀を続けることを許した、幹部会の監督不行き届きである。新たな幹部会では、そのようなことは起きないだろう。"
 IRK_mutiny_an_ironclad_union_desc: "異論を唱えたり、権威を疑ったりしている場合ではない。連邦は崩壊の危機に直面しており、その危機は不統一感から生まれたものだ。政府内の一部では、この反乱で我々の関心が他に移っていることが、自分たちの思惑を推進したり改革を推し進めるチャンスだと考えている。もし、このような裏工作が野放しにされれば、我が国は滅亡の道をたどるかもしれない。\n\nヤゴーダは幹部会と政府全体におけるすべての派閥主義を直ちに停止するよう命じた。危機の間は、これに関連する公認の議案のみを審議し、実行することができる。この命令を覆そうとする者は、我々がどれほど真剣であるかを思い知ることになるだろう。我々の仲間から建設的な批判を受け入れる余裕のある日が、いずれは来るかもしれない。だがそれは今日ではない。"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_shadows_desc: "我々の武器として残っている最大のものは、諜報機関である。ロシアが分裂したとき、連邦を存続させ、イルクーツクに革命のための新しい家を切り開いたのは、NKVDのエージェントたちだった。NKVDの工作員やスパイは、世界で最も経験豊富な集団である。今こそ彼らを利用して、サブリンとその裏切り者一味に対抗し、新興の反乱軍を内部から切り崩すときだ。\n\nバイカル湖の向こう側にある脆弱な新政府は、潜入と破壊工作には完璧なターゲットである。未熟な素人が国家運営を模索しているのだ。我々の諜報員が裏切り者や二重スパイの振りをして潜入するには問題ないだろうし、多くの場合は身分を隠す必要さえないだろう。すぐにパルチザンは混乱し、彼らの計画や秘密はすべて我々の前に曝け出されることになる。"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_state_security_desc: "謀略と諜報の戦争では、攻撃よりも防御がより重要である。反乱軍の秘密を暴きながら、我々の秘密が暴かれないように予防策を講じなければならない。この重要な任務を担っているのが、NKVDの内部部局である国家保安総局である。党派的な活動を根絶するのは難しいが、それを可能にするのが彼らである。\n\n完全な忠誠心を持っていない政府のメンバーは監視下に置かれ、反乱を始める前に反逆者と呼ばれていた人物と関係があった者も同様の処置を受ける。諜報員はすべての町や都市に配置され、トラブルの兆候に耳を傾けることになる。そして、侵入者を阻止するためにパトロール隊が地方を巡回する。イルクーツクは諜報のブラックホールと化すだろう。"
 IRK_mutiny_mobile_interrogation_centers_desc: "一刻を争う事態となれば、貴重な情報を持つ捕虜を迅速に安全な後方に移送できない場合もある。捕虜を取調室に入れ、そこから搾り取った情報を前線に持ち帰るという手間を除いても、情報の抽出だけですでに時間がかかるのだ。この問題の解決策は単純で、取調室を前線に持ち込むことだ。\n\n情報抽出や暗殺を専門とする諜報員や、彼らが業務に使用する道具を運搬するためにトラックを何台か改造すれることで、サブリン派の捕虜の尋問にかかる時間と効率を大幅に向上させることができる。さらにこのトラックが評判になれば、尋問に伴う不快な手法が不要になるかもしれない。トラックの恐怖は、最も頑強なパルチザンをも打ち砕くことだろう。"
 IRK_mutiny_trials_fitting_for_traitors_desc: "裏切り者には試練が相応しい"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_propaganda_desc: "戦時において、プロパガンダが勝敗を分けることがある。味方の士気を高く保ち、敵の士気を低く抑えることが重要である。現在の反乱でも例外ではなく、宣伝省は我々の勝利が必然であることを皆に喧伝するため、懸命に働いている。彼らは最近、前線の両陣営の兵士に向けた2本立ての宣伝攻勢を準備した。\n\n我々は忠実な兵士たちに、同志が演じた勇敢な物語を聞かせ、彼らが続けてる抵抗と英雄主義の長い遺産を思い起こさせることで鼓舞する。さらに、我が軍の優位性を証明するプロパガンダを裏切り者の賊軍に浴びせ、我々に仇名すものに付き従うことの愚かさを暴露するのである。"
 IRK_mutiny_remember_the_revolution_desc: "サブリンは自分がレーニンの革命の延長上にあって、自分は真のレーニン主義者であり彼の取り巻きの屑共が十月革命の精神的な継承者であるような印象操作を行っている。これは明らかにナンセンスであるが、多くの国民はこのような嘘に踊らされている。パルチザンが欺瞞的な反動主義者に過ぎないのに対して、我々が労働者革命の松明を担っているということを証明しなければならない。\n\n宣伝省は、サブリンの手法に基づいたキャンペーンを開始する。10月革命を思い出すこと、レーニンの目標に忠実であることなど。だが、もっとうまくやる予定だ。サブリンは、思想家や知識人が理論を引用し合うだけのグループから抜け出せないでいる。一方、我々は適切な予算のもとで働くプロの宣伝担当のチームを持っており、我々のメッセージを広く伝えることができる。"
 IRK_mutiny_for_it_forever_lives_on_desc: "永遠に生き続ける為に"
 IRK_mutiny_the_union_forever_desc: "勝利は目前だ。数ヶ月に及ぶ戦いの後、我々はついに裏切り者を追い返し、今度は致命傷を与える準備をしている。この臆病者たちは連邦が最も弱いときを突いて破壊を試みたが、歴史から教訓を得なかったようだ。ヨーロッパを横断した最強のドイツ軍ですら我々を滅ぼせなかったのだから、誰にも滅ぼすことはできない。彼らは、唯一のチャンスは我々が背を向けた頃合いに攻撃することだと知っていたが、それさえも失敗した。\n\n勝利の後は、分断された領土の再建を開始する時だ。この絶望的な反乱は、ソビエト連邦を倒す見込みはなかったが、ソビエト連邦を変えてしまうだろう。実際のところ、そもそもこのような事態を許した古い現状に戻すことは確かにできない。反乱軍やパルチザンとの戦いに明け暮れている限りは、ロシアを取り戻すことはできないだろう。何が起ころうとも、我々は勝利が保証されていることを自覚して前進する。連邦は崩壊しないし、崩壊させてはならない。"
 IRK_postwar_the_union_victorious_desc: "同志たちよ、ソビエト連邦の人民はやり遂げたのだ！反抗的なサブリン派は完全に粉砕され、我々はこの戦いから完全な栄光の勝利を収めた！我々は再び強さを証明し、隣人に我々が戦わずして倒れることがないことを示したのだ。\n\nしかし、戦いが終わったからと言って、祝っている時間はない！今こそ再編成し、サブリン派に正義の鉄槌を下す時だ！\n\nソビエト連邦に、敵がぶら下がる最後の糸を切り、人々が最も悲惨な状態にあっなお警戒心と力を持ち続けていることをサブリン派に示す時が来たのだ！"
 IRK_postwar_the_great_purge_desc: "ソビエト連邦は、このような規模の反革命的反乱を二度と起こしてはならない。ロシアが灰の中から立ち上がり、連邦が安定した存在となったことを示すため、我々の地方行政府はこのような反政府勢力が我々に対し蜂起することを決して許してはならない。この問題の根源である無能な者、腐敗した者を叩く必要がある。\n\n我々の政府が不可分であり続けるため、§V大粛清§!が切実に必要とされている。リードし、管理するうえで無能である役人を集めなければならない。彼らに待っているものは、彼らの罪の凶悪さに応じた銃殺刑、終身刑、または党からの除名のいずれかであろう。\n\n特に腐敗した者にとっては、物置の奥のほうで頭に銃弾を受けるのが最もふさわしい行動であろう。国民がこれほどの無能に代表されていては、安定した連邦はありえない……"
 IRK_postwar_assemble_the_commission_desc: "我々の組織に潜む汚物を効果的に除去するために、粛清を行うことが肝要である。そのために委員会を設置し、疑惑のある幹部から情報を収集し、あらゆる手段で処分していく。ただし、委員会のメンバーをNKVDの正規職員で構成することはできない。そこで、NKVDの中から必要なスキルを持った人材をスカウトし、採用することで計画を実現させることにした。\n\n結局のところ、ソビエト連邦の人民のために汚れ仕事を処理する適切な委託先なしに、我々の内部の粛清を確約することは不可能なのだ。"
 IRK_postwar_recall_suspect_personnel_desc: "NKVDが処罰の対象としている容疑者は大勢いる。彼らの容疑が単なる無能な場合でも、より極端な腐敗のケースでも、粛清のために彼らの職を解かなければならない。\n\nしかし、粛清の対象となる人々が無能であったり、汚職の痕跡があったとして、彼らをその地位から排除して空白のままにしておくわけにはいかない。その空いたポジションは埋めなければならないのだ。\n\n彼らの仕事の穴を埋めるために、臨時の人材を据えることとする。権力の空白を放置していては、さらに連邦を不安定化させかねない。"
 IRK_postwar_the_investigations_desc: "NKVDの手からずっと逃れられる者は存在しないが、我々が迫っている容疑者の中には、政治機構に深く入り込みすぎていて簡単に排除できない者もいることが明らかになった。委員会が発足した今、我々は自分にまで捜査の手が及ばないと思い込んでいる腐敗した役人の証拠を集めるため、幅広い調査を開始することにした。運が良ければ具体的な証拠が見つかり、逮捕を続けることができるだろう。\n\nしかし、本格的な取り締まりを開始するための十分な材料が揃ったところで、逮捕した役人をどう処遇するかという問題が残る。証拠を手にした委員会は、容疑者の罪の重さ、つまり処罰の重さを決めるために動くことになる。\n\nこのような寄生虫の多くは国家の敵であることが判明して、国民に対する愚かな犯罪として粛清されるに違いない。だが一部にはそこまでの悪人ではなく、自分の過ちに気づくよう促すことができる者もいるかもしれない。このような軽犯罪者を粛正するかどうかは、証拠を集めて検討した後、最終的には同志ヤゴーダとNKVDの判断に委ねられるだろう。"
 IRK_postwar_zero_tolerance_desc: "我々は、無能で腐敗した者が統治者の地位に留まり続けることを容認することはできない。官僚から大臣に至るまで、粛清によって逮捕・起訴された者は、いかなる場合でも復職させない。\n\n「ネズミ捕り」で捕まった者には容赦しないが、釈放された者でも二度と政界には戻れない。彼らが権力を握っている間に受けた損害はすでに酷いものであり、彼らを復帰させれば、我が政権に再び与える損害は計り知れないものになるだろう。\n\nソビエト連邦は、彼らのような堕落した官僚が再び政権に這い上がってきて、体制を腐敗させるようなリスクを冒すことはできない。"
 IRK_postwar_opportunities_for_forgiveness_desc: "我々の手の届く範囲に、輝かしい共和国の再興のために利用できる可能性のある、あるグループがいる。前政権での彼らの役割は非常に効果的だったが、その効果は腐敗という代償を払うことになりた。\n\nしかし今こそ、そうした行政能力の高い大臣たちを、われわれの政権に取り込むチャンスなのだ。\n\nこの人々をうまく利用し、彼らに救済を約束することができる。彼らは元の地位を取り戻し、我々は彼らの罪の痕跡を消すことができる。ただし、彼らが再び誤った行動を繰り返さないという厳しい条件付きで……だが。"
 IRK_postwar_the_irkutsk_trials_desc: "その時が来た。捜査は完了し、法的手段も決定した。国家の敵を一掃するため、行動を起こさねばならない。\n\n我々はあらゆる手段を用いて、有罪であると確認された者を裁判にかける。反革命分子、腐敗した官僚、裏切り者、寄生虫などが裁きを免れ得ないことを、人民の前に直接示すのだ。\n\nそして彼らがいなくなれば、国家はようやく安泰になる。われわれはそれを実現する。"
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_the_mutiny_desc: "恥晒しのサブリン派が連邦に対し起こした反乱であるブリヤート反乱のイデオロギーは間違ったところにあった。彼らは反抗しようとした真の革命によって打ち砕かれたが、我々は彼らの戦術能力について少しメモを取った方が良いだろう。\n\n反乱軍があれほどの支持者を武装せられたというのは実に興味深いものであり、我々はこの点につき調査をすべきだ。彼らがどのようにしてこのようなことをやり遂げたのかを分析し、それらの結果を連邦軍にどう活かすかを検討する必要があろう！\n\nサブリン派は戦術を良く使うことはできなかったかもしれないが、連邦はそれらを己のものとし、より効果的に運用するだろう！"
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_their_spirit_desc: "反乱の背後にあったその原動力が何かわかるか、同志？それは連邦の打倒、そして反乱者の政府へ取って代わらせたいという彼らの希望そして願望だった。\n\n反乱者であるサブリン主義者が何を政権奪取の希望としたか、彼らが連邦に代わる自分たちの穴だらけなシステムをどのように作り上げたのかを知ることで、我々は何を得ることができるのかメモしておかなければならない。\n\nもし我々がサブリンではなく、むしろ連邦のロシア人民のため、同じ愛国心の灯火に火をつけられれば、我々はこれから多くのものを得られるだろう、同志。"
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_sablin_desc: "サブリンのやったことは、ソビエト連邦の支持してきたものに対する非常に不名誉な裏切りだったが、彼の政策を研究し、応用することで何かしらの利益が得られるかもしれない。\n\nかつて彼を支持していた者たちから支持を高め、彼が抱き続けた思想を活用するためには、サブリンのシステムをベースにしたいくらかの小さな改革を行う必要があると思われる。"
 IRK_postwar_rebuilding_our_legitimacy_desc: "偉大で強力なソビエト連邦は打ち砕かれ、世界の舞台においては崩壊したも同然である－－これは連邦内のすべての人間にとっての大惨事である。\n\nドイツによる連邦侵攻以来、我々は内部から引き裂かれ、少しずつ崩れていき、今のような状態にまで衰退してしまった。だがこのような挫折を味わおうとも、我々はそう簡単には諦めない。我々の目標を達成するためには、政府の正統性を取り戻し、我々が真のロシアの指導者として認められていた頃に戻らなければならない！\n\n連邦の再生のためにどのような手段をとるにせよ、我々は再び大国としての地位を取り戻し、ロシアの人々を世界の舞台での正当な地位へと戻さなければならないのだ！"
 IRK_postwar_a_union_of_letters_desc: "Since the fall of our Union decades ago, opportunists, counter-revolutionaries, and fools alike have fought an unceasing war to destroy our legitimacy. The Sablinite rebellion was the last in a long line of betrayals and traitorous acts, each designed to lead the masses astray towards their own inevitable destruction.\n\nAfter so many brushes with annihilation, many in the Presidium believe it is high time to turn inward. While we have always acted with their best interests at heart, It is clear that much of our population has lost faith in their government's ability to uphold the ideals of the revolution and provide for them.\n\nIn light of this, and in an attempt to expedite reintegration of the Buryat ASSR, we will begin a new campaign, one of \"1000 letters\".\n\nNamed after the 17th century \"republic of letters\", we will attempt to foster a similar culture of innovation. Open criticism in all levels of government will be encouraged, so long as it is constructive. Workers and bureaucrats alike will be asked to mail in their thoughts and concerns regarding our reunification struggle.\n\nHopefully such actions will lead to an efficient administration, attraction of distant intellectuals, and a renewed sense of connection between the masses and their vanguard party."
 IRK_postwar_necessary_reforms_desc: "The 1000 Letters campaign has proven to be exceptionally fruitful! Peasants and bureaucrats alike have risen to the occasion, making use of this unique opportunity for critical expression directed to the Presidium itself. We have received well over 1000 letters, each detailing workplace grievances and various administrative inefficiencies.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most encouraging result of our effort has been the expansion of legitimacy among the formerly rebellious Buryat ASSR. While it is true that the eastern shores of Lake Baikal were relatively timid in composing letters, those that we have collected have proven highly valuable. In addition, the lack of a crackdown upon those that spoke freely seems to have eased tensions. Acts of sabotage are steadily declining, and it appears we just might be able to deprogram those taken hostage by opportunism yet.\n\nNow comes the time of transformation. From words we have devised actions; Increases in low level pay, a tempered five year grain quota, and the closing of managerial loopholes. These programs, as well as other collected reforms, will soon be implemented to compound upon the trust we have built. Let us make haste."
 IRK_postwar_an_internal_affair_desc: "One of the core tenets of Leninism is the vanguard party. The party exists to protect the people from the capitalists, and help instill class consciousness. In order to achieve this goal, only the most educated and politically advanced people can run the higher functions of the state, not the average worker. To directly involve the people could risk needless inefficiency at a critical time, especially as we reorganize the Union. We must rely only on ourselves to reform the state, and not the people, as to maintain our Leninist ideals and prevent needless corruption, along with false consciousness, from ending the Union!"
 IRK_postwar_bolster_nkvd_presence_desc: "While we have managed to prevent ourselves from being conquered, the fact of the matter is that lawlessness is all too common here, especially in the outskirts of our territory, away from our centers of control. In order to rectify the situation, a decision has been made to increase NKVD patrols, and increase their presence in the outskirts. An open showing of security will force the criminals to retreat underground, and allow us to reassert our authority.

The people do not trust in our state's ability to ensure their safety anymore, which is truly disheartening. We need to show the people, through propaganda, speeches, and initiatives, that the USSR merely seeks to build socialism from within, nurturing it in order to protect the people. Furthermore, we must ensure the people understand that the Presidium, and Yagoda, do not exist just to be a distant ruler, but to ensure your safety and security in a time when that is all too rare. By increasing the rate of patrols throughout the cities, and having an increased presence of security in the countryside, we can hopefully express that yes, we will keep the people safe!"

Once the east is secured with our righteous fervor and might, we shall move deeper and deeper into our lost heartland, and drive the traitors who abandoned the Union back, either into retreat or into the ground. With the spirited guidance of the legitimate leader of the Union, Comrade Yagoda, our failure in the brutal conflicts to come is a near impossibility.

This is simply preposterous! We see again and again the results of an unguarded populace - the creation of reactionary regimes that have enslaved Mother Russia!

Now, with the USSR united politically and his preeminent rivals in ditches or the gulag, it is time for the dominant Yagoda to enact his philosophy, the Yagodaschina.\n\nTo epitomize Yagoda's beliefs in one word would be order.

Within the ranks of the NKVD there is a disease festering and growing, its malignance a hamper to the security of the Motherland and her loyal citizens! This was more than proven when thousands deserted the Union for that traitor Sablin. We must rip out this tumor from the ranks of the single most important organ of our administration and ensure it is unable to grow any stronger, preventing it from endangering the safety of our nation once again.\n\nTo be attacked are the issues of corruption and bureaucratic excess that have held back the NKVD from reaching the heights that we desire. A secret subcommittee is to be created to explore corruption, locating those who skim money off the top and target their political rivals. Lists of these individuals are to be sent to Yagoda for approval of their removal as part of the most recent purge. A separate subcommittee has been approved to investigate the issue of overwhelming bureaucracy, one that Yagoda firmly believes is paralyzing its effectiveness.

This has the two-fold effect of increasing loyalty as well as strengthening the security apparatus and expanding its reach.\n\nWhile rewards are given, it is important to ensure that previous issues with corruption are dodged, and so the subcommittee investigating corruption is to be maintained to ensure the integrity of the NKVD, and in turn, the security of the true successor to the Union."

In so doing we would be singling out their antiquated nature (therefore sidelining them) and ending the conflict between these two factions.\n\nWe believe that this is a major step in ending the political instability that has paralyzed our attempts at reuniting the Union and now provide us with a base from which to create a New Russia.

In response to this, we have decided to consolidate our power and centralize the NKVD further, delegating less, ensuring that everyone is directly accountable, and putting our allies in positions of practical power while our enemies sit in prison at best and in meaningless offices at worst.\n\nCentral power and authority are key tenets of Yagoda's philosophy, and seeing it not fully carried out in his own base of power has made him suspicious that his government is not as unified as he thought he had made it. Reorganizing the NKVD is the first of many measures to better realize his dream."

 IRK_regional_tighten_bureaucratic_oversight_desc: "The subcommittee investigating the state bureaucracy has turned up with interesting results. A memorandum, suspiciously authored by some of Yagoda's close political allies, has suggested that the state, and therefore the NKVD, take closer and more hands-on control of these matters. Increased oversight as well as increased accountability has therefore been approved by the General Secretary's stamp and now all matters of state bureaucracy have been made openly available to the NKVD.\n\nThis will serve to increase our control over state affairs and create a more streamlined state approach. Corruption, excess, and waiting times will also all be cut down on as the aforementioned accountability forces public servants to not cut corners and work according to strict state deadlines. A culture of work, love of work, and fulfillment for state work will be fostered, and will be the backbone of a new nation."

He consistently shows an ability to organize the inner workings of the Union. His dedicated work is an example to all those who have the honor of offering their time in the support of the new Russian civil administration, and so he has been elevated to the head of the movement.

In a Russia shattered by infighting, external pressures, and crippled by war, there is no place that needs the strict order-based rule of a man like our General Secretary more.\n\nYagoda will lead us into a strong future, where one day the people of Russia will no longer need to fear German bombers, fascist puppets, or cowardly bandits. In the name of the Motherland our people march united, united in an unstoppable march of progress towards those bright horizons, where the light at the end of the tunnel lies.

One week a few token responsibilities would be transferred from the Premier to the Presidium, the next the army would gain a small measure of autonomy from the NKVD. Soon it was undeniable though. Yagoda's clique was losing control of the Union, and the more ideological members of the Presidium were stepping in to take charge. A silent, bloodless revolution was under way that would return the Soviet Union to Lenin's founding vision.\n\nWith their power now secure, the Presidium has drafted a bold set of new reforms to be implemented. From expanding voting rights to issuing universal identification, the party hopes to turn away from the cloistered dictatorship that Yagoda and the NKVD fostered. Under Lenin, the Union was strong and prosperous. Returning to his plan for Russia is the only way to reclaim all that has been lost."

 IRK_regional_a_return_to_leninism_desc: "When Bukharin took the reins after Comrade Lenin's death, no one could have guessed the consequences. The need for a strong state to guard the revolution was used as an excuse to establish a dictatorship more interested in maintaining power than advancing the revolution. Bukharin let the Union grow weak and failed to defend it when the Germans invaded. After Yagoda seized power the problems only worsened. He reduced the Union to nothing more than an NKVD client state that paid lip service to the revolution and nothing else.\n\nIt is far past time we returned to the original course Lenin set for us. There must be a true dictatorship of the proletariat, not simply a bourgeois dictatorship dressed in red. The liberation of the working class must always be at the forefront of our minds. This commitment to the revolution may not be popular with some of the old guard, but since when have revolutionaries cared what the bureaucrats think?"

 IRK_regional_sideline_the_state_desc: "The state faction, consisting of the NKVD, Yagoda's old guard, and the more conservative members of the Presidium, once ruled Irkutsk with an iron fist. Their pragmatism was essential to the Union's survival in the dark days that followed the collapse of the war against fascism, but now their time has passed.\n\nWith the Party consolidating its hold on the government, working across the aisle with those in the State faction is no longer necessary. We can begin relegating them to unimportant duties where they will be unable to obstruct our work. Many of our most talented bureaucrats and government workers are members of the State faction. The loss of their skills and experience will be something of a setback, but we cannot afford to have counterrevolutionaries sabotaging our government from within. Once we issue all of the reassignments the Party's control of the nation will be total, and the way forward to the Union's reclamation will finally be clear of internal obstructions."

They hold significant influence in the government, the party media, and in almost every industry in the state. While all of them are registered members of the Communist Party and claim to be dedicated revolutionaries, in practice they represent a new elite that rules over the workers while trying to run the nation for their own benefit. It is no surprise that the Nomenklatura are almost universally supporters of the State faction that would preserve the status quo they thrive in.\n\nIf we want to call ourselves a real revolutionary government, we have to put an end to this new bourgeoisie. There is no doubt that they will use their ample resources and influence to oppose us, or that purging so many experienced bureaucrats will hurt our administration, but these are the sacrifices a Leninist state must be willing to make to achieve a true communist society."
 IRK_regional_erode_the_security_edifice: "Erode the Security Edifice"
 IRK_regional_erode_the_security_edifice_desc: "Under Yagoda's rule the Soviet government became little more than a glorified rubber stamp, existing only to legitimize the real masters of the Union, the NKVD. Over the years the nation was transformed into a securocracy, a government run by and for the intelligence services. Even as the NKVD-friendly state faction declines into irrelevance, many of the administrative structures and loopholes they put in place for Yagoda's henchmen remain.\n\nIf we eliminated these loopholes, it would go a long way towards relegating the NKVD back to its original purpose: protecting the revolutionary state, not controlling it. Reducing the NKVD's role in the government would also ease the administrative burden we are currently grappling with. Fewer people being consulted and improved delegation of responsibilities will make it easier for the Presidium and its agencies to take decisive action."

Since Lenin's original revolution there have always been people who refuse to accept our rule and attempt to disrupt our society, and there must be somewhere to send these people. During the reign of the NKVD the number of people sent to the gulags greatly increased, and many of those imprisonments were not justified. Men and women who were proud revolutionaries and dedicated members of the Communist Party were imprisoned simply for questioning Yagoda and his allies. We must correct this.\n\nThe files of every political prisoner must be reviewed to see which ones are suitable for release. By officially redeeming these prisoners we will not only be regaining many bright minds and strong bodies that will serve the Union, but we will have earned their undying loyalty as their liberators."

Lenin called for a Dictatorship of the Proletariat, but this sort of dictatorship is not mutually exclusive with democracy. While the Communist Party is the vanguard of the revolution and must always maintain control over the revolutionary state, a form of limited democracy within the party can be allowed.\n\nUnder this new system we will allow party members who have worked within the government for a minimum of 4 years and are found to be in good political and moral standing to vote on various matters. Of course, only communists will be allowed to vote and run for office, but even a limited form of democracy will prove to the people that we are not just another despotic government."

Their strong opposition to NKVD interference in their work made them our natural partners, but with our common enemy now reduced to irrelevancy, there is little left to unite us. To avoid allowing any distance to form between the Union's government and its military a few members of the Presidium have recommended striking a bargain with the commanders of the Red Army.\n\nThis deal would involve allocating more of the budget to the military to fund modernization efforts and improvements to the training curriculum. The generals have clamored for more funding for some time, and granting it to them will strengthen the bonds between the Communist Party and the Red Army. It would also have the added benefit of strengthening our military for a future conflict, which seems likely if Russia is to be reunited."

We were told to stick to theorizing about the revolution and inspiring the masses to support the Union while they ran the show. They said we wouldn't know how to run a nation, and we would fail without them. We have proven them wrong.\n\nThere is no denying that at first there were difficulties. The bureaucracy had to be purged of those who tried to oppose us, leaving many of our departments gutted. The fact that we had just reclaimed a huge stretch of territory did not make establishing a new system any easier. But we learned as we went and we consolidated our control. Now our rule is unquestioned across all of eastern Siberia. Every town from Irkutsk to Kamchatka flies the red banner, knowing that they serve the Revolutionary state. Lenin's dream is not dead.

General Secretary Yagoda has triumphed over all of the combined forces of fascism, liberalism and anarchy that once beset his rule, and in doing so guaranteed the survival of the communist system he has helped to perfect. His enemies lie in graves, their ideas alongside them, and it is only a matter of time before all of Russia is reunified under the only true successor to the USSR. It is only a matter of time now before all of Russia from Vladivostok to Kiev is seized from its occupiers, and all the people of this great land saved from the enemies of the people that dwell within it.\n\nIt is not enough to say that the Soviet Union will merely survive this crisis: it will be strengthened by it. The rebirth of communism and the perfection of its form under Comrade Yagoda has rendered the system stronger and more proficient than ever before, ready and capable to both see to the needs of the people and to enact the destruction of their enemies. Our journey is far from over, but the ship of state is on the right course, and the best possible man to lead Russia and reforge the Soviet Union is secure at the helm. There is nothing that communism cannot overcome, no enemy that the Soviet Union cannot defeat, and no man that can stand in the way of the General Secretary any longer. Our victory is assured, but we are still earlier in our destiny, and there are many enemies yet to vanquish and struggles yet to suffer.

Peace and prosperity have returned to this war-torn land, and all across Siberia the people are celebrating our return to power.\n\nSome celebration is certainly due, but our task is far from over. To our west are traitors and warlords who seek to steal Russia for themselves. Beyond them lie the Nazis who still enslave many of our people.

The previous mixed system of rural agrarianism combined with the industrialization of urban centers is unfeasible within the present economic international realities. In fact, agriculture's contribution to an average country's GDP no longer constitutes the majority. The dominant economies of the world are approaching a new model largely oriented towards the service sector and the integration of recent technological development into praxis.\n\nWhat this means for us, simply speaking, is we need to catch up with the rest of the world. While some plans for rapid modernization have been outlined, it has been decided that the matter should rather be approached cautiously. Reckless transition straight to a service-based economy will only harm the Union in the long run. For now, we must go through an evolutionary path and focus on properly restarting the key industrial centers of the Far East."

However, many within the party are opposed to what they view as a betrayal of practices established by Bukharin, to whose Siberian Plan our government owes much of its current assets.\n\nTo prevent a disastrous split within the party, Comrade Yagoda has devised what he calls \"The Transitional Approach to Economics\". It has been described as a set of conceptual principles that pragmatically amalgamates major aspects of Lenin's and Bukharin's economic theories with Yagoda's own thesis. It declares the present state of the Union \"transitional\" between a market system and developed, \"true socialism\". Thus, it guarantees the position of both the state and private enterprise, satisfying both factions that have emerged over this dilemma, and bringing over the Age of Transition."

This will, naturally, rationalize the local management of the economy, increasing awareness of the problems in each given area.\n\nBut the greatest advantage of this policy, and the one we're after, is if we use the precedent of these zones' autonomous bureaucracies, we can establish separate economic legislation there. This would allow us to selectively loosen restrictions for foreign trade and investment, without compromising on greater national trade policies, while still bringing foreign capital to work developing our backward regions.\n\nConveniently, the region that would benefit most from this is the Pacific Coast with the zones there drawn around the urban ports, already promising centers of international trade."
 IRK_regional_invest_in_transportation: "Invest in Transportation"
 IRK_regional_invest_in_transportation_desc: "Of all the land of the former Union, our government managed to reclaim the Far East. And while the region has a proud history of brave settlers taming the frontier, and partisans fighting reactionary tyrants, it was regrettably neglected by previous instances of leadership. It was largely a backwater peripheral region in the days of the empire and was often underinvested into even by Lenin's administration. Comrade Bukharin did have plans for renovating its economy as part of the Siberian Plan, but they, regrettably, came to pass only partially, as the Union was ultimately shattered.\n\nThe consequences of this centuries' worth of neglect are most prevalent in the transport sector of the economy. It has been, in fact, determined, that the regional industrial potential's greatest limit is the capabilities of the infrastructure, which are, even in the best cases, below satisfactory. Thankfully, the Transitional Approach takes transportation into account, with the new economic zones granted funds and economic authority to make the necessary investment in transportation facilities to achieve the goals set in the greater All-Union Plan."
 IRK_regional_form_the_special_economic_sectors: "特別経済部門の形成"
 IRK_regional_form_the_special_economic_sectors_desc: "Some of the economists within the government recently came up with an intriguing proposal. They suggest some regions be designated as \"Special Economic Sectors\", with free market-type regulations, flexible trade policy and tax incentives to promote the concentration of capital and technological investment.\n\nWhile initially proposed as an alternative to Economic Zoning, this initiative gained traction within the party, with pushing for adopting both policies alongside each other, arguing there would be mutual benefit from cooperation between the two new types of economic autonomies. Comrade Yagoda sees no reason to object."
 IRK_regional_invite_boeing: "ボーイングを招待"
 IRK_regional_invite_boeing_desc: "Among the foreign corporations who expressed interest in allocating some of their assets to the new sectors provided for investments by our Union, the Boeing Company seems to be the most indecisive, which has caused considerable difficulties due to our own aviation industry being quite underdeveloped. While the large distances between our urban centers create a sizable civilian aviation market and the applications of their military developments are obvious, the world's largest aerospace contractor sits on the fence, reluctant to cooperate with us.\n\nEvidently, the entrepreneurs behind Boeing distrust the proclamation of the Transitional Approach that we made. As the policy is nominally a temporary measure, it deters them from investing, fearing they would lose the funds when the transition to a fully state-controlled socialist model comes in the future. We must convince them, along with various other investors, that we are not planning on returning to war communism anytime soon, and that their investments in the future of our Union will pay off."
 IRK_regional_a_rival_for_the_sphere: "共栄圏のライバル"
 IRK_regional_a_rival_for_the_sphere_desc: "One key factor that many analysts and economical theorists of the Union have continuously brought up since the time of the Far East's reunification, is the greater international picture we now find ourselves in. Our main concern is the imperialist ambition of Japan, over the years culminated in the foundation of the so-called 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' - a periphery of satellite states clearly aimed at the exploitation of their resources and peoples by Tokyo. Unfortunately, as the dominant power in Asia, their empire theoretically enjoys a degree of influence and might far above the Union's.\n\nHowever, in actuality, the Sphere is a crumbling structure, built to inspire awe, but not to last. Recent developments have shown, that its diplomatic alienation deprived it of developed trading partners, which in combination with bureaucratic incompetence has significantly damaged the Sphere's economic potential, to the point where we can directly compete with them on the international stage.\n\nBy putting our efforts towards actively toppling Japan from its seat of economic power in Asia we can both benefit from replacing that position ourselves, and undermine one of our most dangerous regional competitors. After that, the bright future of our Union's economy shall be all but assured."
 IRK_regional_echoes_of_the_siberian_plan: "シベリア計画の反響"
 IRK_regional_echoes_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "After a series of debates, including those on the role of the state in the economy, the anti-Bukharinist revisionist demagogues have been exposed and denounced by those truly loyal to the Party and its efforts in building socialism! The New Economic Policy has once rebuilt the Union from the devastation brought by the Civil War. It will rebuild the Union again from the ruins of a collapsed Russia!\n\nIt has thus been decided, that the Siberian Plan, which was aimed at developing the economy of the region after the union's government was forced to relocate east, shall be continued, albeit with a few corrections. Notably, with the party's main target being the complete reunification of lost territories, noticeably major share of investment is to be devoted to military production and heavy industry."
 IRK_regional_import_industrial_machinery: "産業機械の輸入"
 IRK_regional_import_industrial_machinery_desc: "As the old Siberian Plan mostly centered the state investments on heavy industrial buildup, our present economic apparatus shall toe this line. However, it faces a series of problems, the most important of which is the loss of a considerable amount of industrial equipment over the process of collapse and the subsequent restoration of soviet power in the Far East.\n\nWhile the existing production complex can be rerouted towards the machine industry to replace the absent pieces of machinery, it would completely derail the plan and serve as a completely irrational waste of resources. It has instead been decided to import the missing parts of the production cycle so that the domestic industry can focus on the original goals of the economic plan."
 IRK_regional_lessons_from_manchukuo: "満洲国の教訓"
 IRK_regional_lessons_from_manchukuo_desc: "The Japanese client state of Manchukuo to our south has historically been surprisingly developed, being at one point the third dominant industrial power in East Asia after Japan itself and the old Union. While the roots of this lie in Japan pumping resources and capital into its puppet state, their management of such resources presents a curious case.\n\nWhile retaining the core tenets of fascist state-monopolistic capitalism, the 'Manchurian Model' as it came to be known largely managed to avoid bureaucratic stagnation through rationalization of management, which allowed for the state to exercise its powers for the optimization of the wartime economy. This is especially evident in sectors of Manchukuo's heavy industry, which at times outperform those of Japan. While we won't resort to copying fascists, the Manchurian Model does illustrate a few principles we can learn from, primarily in the sphere of streamlining bureaucracy."
 IRK_regional_the_shipyards_of_amur: "アムール造船所"
 IRK_regional_the_shipyards_of_amur_desc: "When we defeated the fascist clique of Amur, we reclaimed the small coastal town of Chumikan, long occupied by their so-called \"All-Russian Government\". While the most recent records we have from 1939 list it as barely more than a fishing village, it seems that Rodzaevsky's bandits developed its port out of necessity, so that the Japanese could properly supply their lapdogs with equipment and provisions. Fortunately, this crude transport hub can be repurposed into a proper trading port and shipbuilding facility.\n\nWhile the ports of Magadan and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky could fulfill the task already, they are poorly connected with the regional center. Additionally, sub-optimal climate may render them unusable over the cold period of the year. Thus, Chumikan has been designated as the 'most economically viable port', and is to be developed accordingly, so that our Union can establish a naval presence in the Okhotsk Sea, challenging the crumbling Japanese hegemony."
 IRK_regional_develop_the_aerospace_industry: "航空産業の開発"
 IRK_regional_develop_the_aerospace_industry_desc: "Since the pitiful defeat of the old Union at the hands of the fascist hordes, who truly demonstrated the full potential of aviation - the third dimension of warfare, many have expressed their desire to invest in the aviation industry. However, with the relocation to Siberia, we lost much expertise, and now is the first time we find our industry capable of rearming the air force up to modern standards.\n\nWhile the production base is already capable of producing airplanes, the main challenge we are posed with is the lack of technological insight. To remedy this, a curious proposal has been made by a group of theorists. It includes various projects aimed to increase cooperation between the military and the scientific complexes, to ensure that the Union will reach the skies, and perhaps, one day, the stars."
 IRK_regional_the_resources_of_siberia: "シベリアの資源"
 IRK_regional_the_resources_of_siberia_desc: "History shows that many nations' efforts to industrialize were hampered by lack of a resource base. Some lacked the metals for heavy machinery, some were short on fossil fuels to supply factories. Fortunately, our Union finds itself fully supplies itself from the inexhaustible riches of Siberia.\n\nWhile a point has been made that a full-scale resource-based economy would be harmful in the long term, it's simply foolish to ignore the deposits of raw material that could become our primary source of income. And although it is universally agreed that the economy should be diversified, investments into resource gathering operations have been found necessary to supply our industrial complex in the process of modernization."
 IRK_regional_investments_for_the_peasants: "農民投資"
 IRK_regional_investments_for_the_peasants_desc: "While the party might be split over the question of what role should the state have in the process of industrialization, it is largely united when it comes to policies required to revitalize the agriculture of the Union.\n\nThough the present Economic Plan is largely centered around industrial development of urban centers, the quotas for predominantly agrarian rural areas have gone up as well, and several initiatives for intensification of their economies have already come up. One more ambitious proposal is to revive the Machine-Tractor Stations - local enterprises for ownership and maintenance of agricultural machinery, established in the late 1920s. These will allow the underperforming Sovkhozes to modernize with state investment, leading to a considerable increase in agricultural output."
 IRK_regional_compromise_on_imports: "Compromise On Imports"
 IRK_regional_compromise_on_imports_desc: "Ever since the bitter defeat of the Union and its relocation to Siberia, the question of protectionism dominated the disputes regarding matters of Soviet agriculture. With the soils of the Far East are far from fertile, especially when compared to fields of the Russian Plain, a certain amount of products will have to be imported, potentially harming local production.\n\nNow, with the Far East reunified under the rightful authority of comrade Yagoda's government, this question rises again. Fortunately, the Union's economists have found a compromise solution. It calls for a complex system that ensures import contracts are scaled in accordance with the fulfillment of the economic plan. This policy, if streamlined properly, will encourage domestic production of goods that would otherwise be imported without devolving into outright autarky."
 IRK_regional_the_paris_of_siberia: "シベリアのパリ"
 IRK_regional_the_paris_of_siberia_desc: "The city from which we reunified the Far East, Irkutsk, has a glorious history and was one of the most developed even before the old Union's demise. However, what once was known as the Paris of Siberia has come to be in a state of disarray. Many of its buildings are not up to present standards, its streets unoptimized for modern traffic movement, its universities, and industries archaic and obstructing the greater economic plans we have for the region.\n\nIt seems, that much like its namesake in 1853, the Paris of Siberia will require a series of renovations to become a modern urban center. While some comrades suggest postponing it until we again control all of Russia, Comrade Yagoda has ultimately decided that this renewal will be vital to the process of reunification itself and authorized to start it sooner rather than later."
 IRK_regional_urban_development_initiatives: "都市開発投資"
 IRK_regional_urban_development_initiatives_desc: "With the recent drive to renovate Irkutsk, plans for similar projects in other cities of the Far East have been brought up by regional committees and individual urbanists of our union. While the present situation necessitates the majority of them to be put off, some of the ideas concerning major centers have been cautiously accepted by the according authorities.\n\nThese initiatives cover mostly matters of infrastructure, ensuring both better transportation within the cities and between them. A few of the accepted projects also deal with the education system, aiming to enhance its facilities to prepare a future scientific base for the Union."
 IRK_regional_redirect_the_transsib: "Redirect the TransSib"
 IRK_regional_redirect_the_transsib_desc: "One problem we face when managing urban developments is the Trans-Siberian Railway. While its existence is greatly beneficial as the main axis of transportation between the cities of the Far East, the TransSib only covers the southernmost areas of the Union, economically alienating areas unconnected to it, including the prosperous ports on the Okhotsk Sea and resource-rich inland districts of Yakutia.\n\nWhile Sakha's oil and gas reserves need little more than pipeline, for Magadan, de-facto our main port, a railway connection is vital. Thus it has been found necessary to start constructing a new branch of the TransSib, going north, along the Pacific coast. While extending a railway through the depths of Siberia is no easy task, and some are already dubbing it \"The Construction Project of the Century\" due to the difficulties of the initiative, the task itself should be relatively simple to achieve."
 IRK_regional_invest_in_egalitarian_schooling: "Invest in Egalitarian Schooling"
 IRK_regional_invest_in_egalitarian_schooling_desc: "It has become evident over the course of reunification, that in modern warfare, military technological developments significantly influence the outcome of the conflict. Many theorists within the Party have thus turned their minds to optimizing scientific output to further the reclamation of Russia by utilizing new, advanced armaments, and ensure our Union's prosperity thereafter by developing civilian-applied technology.\n\nOne obvious method for that is to develop the academia extensively, through the recruitment of new scientists. It has thus been found detrimental, that in the spirit of proletarian egalitarianism, potential intellectuals of all sexes, nationalities, and backgrounds should be provided the necessary education and resources to conduct research for the benefit of the Union. If we are to achieve this, first we must direct our efforts towards eliminating the few remaining prejudices of the education system. For instance, \"minority talent initiatives\" can be used to reduce those of ethnicities typically glossed over by higher learning."

 IRK_regional_education_is_the_future_desc: "What little flaws the education system once had, we have eliminated! Thanks to our efforts of both realizing the Marxist principle of equality and enhancing the quality of education in our universities and life in our cities, the Union is entering a new age of knowledge and higher learning. Soon, even the most optimistic predictions will be surpassed, and soviet society will truly enter the technological age!\n\nOf course, this utopia of the proletarian mind will not come by on its own. The academia must double their efforts on the cultural and scientific front of the revolutionary struggle, and with their sweat, a new future of the people will be forged. As such, the Union collectively and its every citizen individually must strive to better their education, for it is the future!"
 IRK_regional_the_soviet_armed_forces: "ソビエト軍"
 IRK_regional_the_soviet_armed_forces_desc: "When Yegorov and his sycophants elected to cower in Arkhangelsk instead of joining the Presidium's evacuation to Irkutsk, the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle found itself without a hammer for the first time since the Revolution. Gone were its proud tank corps, artillery battalions and air wings - presuming the general's vainglory, all rent into bone fragments and scrap metal along the A-A Line. Subsequent struggles against reactionaries and revisionists further chipped away at the armed forces until only what remained of the NKVD and its auxiliaries flew the Red Army's tattered banners.\n\nSuffice to say, the Union has recaptured much of its glory since. Its reinvigorated position in the Far East has broadened our options for likewise restoring the Red Army's invincible might. Yet we must not dally in doing so, for Comrade Yagoda eyes westward greater threats to the revolution than bandits and petty warlords. These states' armies will offer us no respite or quarter.\n\nIn due time, neither shall we to them."

 IRK_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution_desc: "The Red Army has never strayed from its principles despite its diminished state. Great Lenin sounded the call for a people's militia, intrinsically intertwined with the class-conscious, to protect the revolution; hence did our generals raise militiamen from Moscow to Irkutsk. Their bayonets were rusty, their rifles antiquated, and their ranks a far cry from the thousand battalions of Chairman Bukharin's time - yet the Union's conscripted soldiery have nevertheless protected our proletariat as an old buckler shields its owner from cuts and crippling blows.\n\nWith the new glut of resources at the Union's disposal, we can now reforge our worn, splintered buckler into the unbreakable aegis that it once was. Soon the Red Army shall meet its foes with tanks, automatic weapons, and fresh divisions of disciplined fighting men."

 IRK_regional_a_coequal_branch_desc: "No matter the fortunes which had befallen our Union, the good men and women of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs never strayed from its side. They had loyally fulfilled their duties since the October Revolution and continue to fulfill their duties even when threats flank the Motherland's every vulnerability. So strong is the NKVD's sense of purpose that it even preoccupies itself with responsibilities beyond its charter, like supplementing the Red Army's equipment and manpower with its own.\n\nIt would be remiss of us not to acknowledge their loyalty simply because our situation has improved. Hence, the Presidium of the Soviet Union has decreed the formalization of the NKVD's de facto status as a separate branch of the Soviet Armed Forces. With this elevation comes a secure place in the Union's annual defense budget in addition to a large say over military affairs - appropriate recompense for a state organ that has proven its worth time and again."

 IRK_regional_trust_in_the_army_desc: "Midday in the snowy plains of Siberia. A Guards battalion spots ramshackle hovels clustered a distance away. Colonel and staff consult HQ's maps - a village, barely a dot, beside the route to their rendezvous point. The men decide to approach, introduce themselves to its elders, perhaps secure provisions to supplement their rations. They expected a welcome conferred to liberators - like in the trickles of Suvorov that made the trek to the distant East.\n\nThe battalion departed with neither welcomes nor provisions an hour later. Bloodshot stares behind rotting wood frames trailed their silhouettes until the horizon swallowed the column whole.\n\nMany more units report similar stories throughout our broad westward front. Each lend credence to an issue heretofore unaddressed: that the people have become so inured to warlordism as to treat any armed formation, even their own protectors, like common marauders. We must address this somehow."
 IRK_regional_recentralize_the_armed_forces: "Re-Centralize the Armed Forces"
 IRK_regional_recentralize_the_armed_forces_desc: "Delegating control of the Red Army's operational tempo to the frontline formations' field officers, rather than an all-seeing general staff, may have sufficed when its greatest engagements consisted of glorified skirmishes, raids and counter-raids against bands of organized thugs. Or when fronts could be measured in hundreds of meters, not miles. Or when signals equipment were worth their weight in gold for how few remained after years of combat losses and neglect.\n\nThese conditions have changed - and not necessarily for the better. Comrade Yagoda clamors for war against warlords our equals in strength and resources, and whose borders likewise equal Russia's breadth. The Comrade's field marshals believe there is no better time than now to reassert high command's supremacy over the battlefield; doing so, they advise, will allow the Red Army to conduct operational art on a scale unseen since the Great Patriotic War."

 IRK_regional_hybrid_training_programs_desc: "With new equipment comes new problems, as quartermasters and strategists are wont to say. Ours now suffer this peculiar curse with the reintegration of old luxuries - heavy armor and air support, in particular - into their divisions. Like a dilapidated truck left to gather dust for lack of fuel forgets how to combust its engine, the Red Army has forgotten how to fight like a proper modern army.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense has begun addressing this issue twofold: first, by expanding the Union's military academies so to accommodate lessons in tank and aerial warfare; and second, by organizing exercises which involve elements from all branches of the Soviet Armed Forces acting in tandem. Practice makes perfect; so too will it make an invincible force in the Union's hands."

Fortunately, the warlords that had surrounded the Union then were in no better condition.\n\nThis becomes less true as we push west, where the men will confront armies fed either by Siberia's industries or the Trans-Ural's ample stockpiles. The Presidium, under Comrade Yagoda's advice, has given the Ministry of Defense Industry a mandate to mass-produce quality weapons for the Red Army's use. In this they will be assisted by near-every factory our divisions reclaim."

We invite stresses to the tenuous logistics networks we've established by committing to such a schedule... but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have found a temporary solution.\n\nThe ports of the Far East - Magadan, Petropavlovsk, Nikolayevsk-on-Amur - are open for trading with the United States and its allies.

There are no specialized units in our armed forces to supply our men. While acceptable for a small warlord, this situation is unacceptable; we will never be able to reclaim our homelands with our army in such a disorganized state!\n\nWe need a specialized logistics branch in our army.

Some might say doing business with capitalist empires is a betrayal of the revolution, but the revolution won't get very far if our trucks don't have wheels.\n\nTo facilitate opening trade with the outside world, we have arranged for the purchase of 100 merchant vessels suitable for hauling large amounts of cargo.

A better term might be collaborators. America and Japan would benefit from a strong Russian nation to oppose Germany, and we would benefit from foreign aid for our quest to retake the Union.

Aligning with them, even temporarily, would open doors to all sorts of arms deals and development plans the Japanese could never hope to finance. The time has come to rebuild the alliance that came so close to defeating fascism 30 years ago.

A gentle reminder that they recognized us over 30 years ago, along with a request that they renew that recognition would significantly boost our credibility in the eyes of the Russian people.

 IRK_regional_increase_japanese_cooperation_desc: "At first glance, the idea of working with the Japanese seems preposterous. They are fascists who openly allied with the Germans in the last war and seized Vladivostok and our territory along the Amur while we had our backs turned. We have every reason to view them as an enemy, and if circumstances were different we almost certainly would. Times have changed, however. Now the fascists are at each other's throats, and while the Japanese stole a city, the Nazis took so much more than that.\n\nOn a practical level, it makes more sense to align with the Japanese than the Americans. Japan wants to see a strong, anti-German Russia as much as America does, but it is geographically closer and far more capable of providing direct support to us. We must set our differences aside, at least for the moment, and focus on the true threat."
 IRK_regional_mission_to_tokyo: "Mission to Tokyo"
 IRK_regional_mission_to_tokyo_desc: "Establishing a close relationship with the Japanese Empire will be no easy feat of diplomacy. The entire Japanese government is an imperial cult which is rightly afraid of our revolutionary ideology. It will take lots of work by our diplomats and negotiators to find an opening just to begin discussions. Only then will we be able to show that we are truly interested in setting aside ideology and focusing on pragmatic cooperation.\n\nOur best opening strategy will be a Soviet diplomatic mission right to the heart of the Empire. In Tokyo, our diplomats will be able to meet with their Japanese counterparts as well as influential politicians and military leaders. Once these connections are made we can begin strengthening our ties. Trade deals, embassies, joint development projects, the list of opportunities goes on and on."

 IRK_regional_expand_manchurian_trade_desc: "With the Japanese now more willing to do business, we can finally start to benefit from their support. Our nation is positioned on the edge of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the largest economic bloc in the world. While becoming too integrated into it would see us reduced to nothing more than puppets of Japan, doing business with the members of the sphere would be an enormous boost to our economy.\n\nTo our south lies the Empire of Manchukuo, Japan's pet project and a burgeoning industrial powerhouse. The Japanese have poured enormous resources into building up Manchukuo's heavy industry, and we stand to benefit from our proximity. We have abundant natural resources that we could trade for finished products. A deal with the Manchurians, along with developing overland connections between our nations is exactly what we need to kickstart the Union's economy in preparation of the reclamation."

 IRK_regional_sponsor_the_proletarian_movement_desc: "Across the world the proletariat still struggles under the oppressive rule of their masters, whether they be bourgeois capitalists or literal slavers. Without the Soviet Union, there was no strong nation to act as the guardian of the workers of the world. For three decades tyrants around the globe took advantage of our absence, abusing and exploiting the lower class.\n\nBut now we are back.\n\nOur financial and political resources are not what they once were, but they are now enough we can resume our support for socialist movements in foreign countries. While we struggled to reclaim our nation from fascists and traitors several other nations around the world took up the revolutionary banner in our absence. We should welcome them into the fold and begin working towards an international organization of socialist nations."

 IRK_regional_revolutionary_aid_funding_desc: "As part of our campaign to increase diplomatic ties between the socialist nations of the world, we must provide a good reason for socialist nations to work together, and more importantly, work with us. The best way to incentivise loyalty and cooperation is with generous amounts of international aid. Some might call this bribery, but that is preposterous. Bribes go to corrupt politicians, while this aid will be going to socialist leaders who stand in solidarity with the proletariat.\n\nBy targeting our donations to specific parties and causes that align with our interests, we can encourage our fellow socialist nations to follow our lead and discourage deviation from the path we have chosen. After all, the Soviet Union was the first nation to embrace the revolution. It is our job to set the course and to make sure the other revolutionary states stick to it."

By creating a system of permanent embassies, each staffed by trained diplomats, we will open up the possibility of ongoing negotiations and communication between all socialist governments. Embassies will also allow for more nuanced diplomatic tactics. The Cameroonians do things very differently than the Russians, and while a delegation to Havana might suffer from culture shock, an embassy there could hold Soviet emissaries who have spent years familiarizing themselves with the nation and its people. The same is true for nations from South America to Europe to Asia.\n\nEstablishing a new socialist embassy system is an instrumental step to creating a global proletarian alliance. We should send this proposal to our prospective allies as soon as possible. The longer we delay, the more time we give the fascists and capitalists to sabotage our plans."

Not only are the Japanese attempting to erase the culture of the Korean people, but they are ruthlessly oppressing the workers of Korea and exploiting them for their labour. They are not unopposed, however. In Northern Korea the NAJUA, led by the freedom fighter Kim Il Sung continue the struggle for Korean independence.\n\nComrade Kim is a proud communist and a shining example of commitment to the revolutionary struggle. If we were to coordinate international support for the NAJUA from socialist nations, it would serve as an excellent show of our diplomatic potency and the strength of cooperation. This act of solidarity with the Korean people will endear us to all who struggle for freedom across the world."

It is time to unveil the culmination of our diplomatic efforts.\n\nWe will recreate the International as a new political and military alliance that will span across the entire world. This alliance of socialist and communist parties from around the globe will promote the revolutionary cause and fight against fascist and capitalist tyranny wherever they are found. The oppressors of this world will quake in fear when they hear of this new alliance. They have fought so hard to divide us, for they know that together we are stronger than them.

One item had caught his attention, though: a shiny red-and-gold medal. \"This is the Order of Lenin\", answered the father before the boy could even open his mouth.\n\n\"Who's Lenin?\" the child asked.

Big walloping booms descended upon the assailants, the product of an American remington.\n\nTwo less then they were before, the NKVD operatives had finally reached their target.

Perhaps it wouldn't have been such a challenge if they weren't young enough to be Popov's children. Getting these youngsters to work with any kind of cohesion has proved to be more difficult than the colonel had ever expected.\n\n\"What are we waiting for? The tyrant's goons lie in wait just beyond that ridge! I say to hell with all of this, we should head over there and kick some ass!\" A spirited young officer said, trying to win over the cramped room with his bluster. Popov found himself getting ready to respond, but a muffled noise from outside distracted him from the moment. Glancing at the window, all he could see was the furious Siberian winter continuing its assault on the glass panes. Perhaps it was just the wind? \"And what is your plan once we get over there,\" one of the other officers asked, \"charge into their lines and die like idiots?\" Popov heard it again, and this time it was closer. The howling wind made it difficult to determine what it was. \"Well, we have to do something! I've been freezing my-\" The brash young officer was cut off by the sound of the door being violently kicked open.\n\nPopov felt his heart leap out of his chest as he turned his attention to the door. Four imposing figures wearing white camouflage coats and brandishing assault rifles began loudly demanding everyone in the room to surrender their arms. His heart sank as he recognized the badges on their hats. The NKVD had come for him. \"I'll never surrender, you bastards!\" the young officer boldly shouted at the assailants as he drew his sidearm. He scarcely had the chance to aim before the soldiers unleashed a vicious storm of lead, gunning down every man in the room besides Popov.

Millions of lives have been sacrificed unwillingly by those who would dare to neglect the lessons of the October Revolution.\n\nThe Buryat 'Sablinites' are next in the long line of this ideological rot. It is a rot that has clearly spread beyond control, as Valery Sablin himself was once a promising NKVD commissar. After being foolishly entrusted to organize labor in the construction of hydroelectric power near Lake Baikal, he seized a radio tower to spew his utopian, convenient revisionism.\n\nYagoda and the loyal remnants of the Presidium bear a gargantuan weight upon their shoulders. Years of defeat have left the Union crippled, and its people susceptible to opportunists and liars. It is all too possible that this burgeoning rebel army could spiral out of control, and spell doom for the last remnant of order and legitimacy in this Russian chaos. The scared peasants who tremble beneath Sablin's lies must be convinced to return to their senses, and the conniving men who lead them must be brought to swift justice."

It was important that such rage was directed, and at this precise moment, it landed upon the guard to his right. A single stare leveled the man. His sloped posture rapidly corrected itself, and the incessant tapping of his foot ceased. That would do.\n\nHis composure regained, Yagoda's eyes returned to the malnourished creature that sat before him. The foolish boy who refused to break, or even bend. A lesser man might be swayed by such a display, but Yagoda was not impressed by traitors. He had seen too many.\n\nHis hands clasped together on the table, and he stared into Sablin's lowered eyes.\n\"I tire of this spectacle. You have been offered a chance to repent your crimes, to show the people the error in your ways and heal the Union you fractured.\"\n\nYagoda noticed a fire flash across the young man's face, the same spark that he had observed upon detainment. He remained defiantly silent.\n\"Maybe you perceive yourself as a brave man. I know better. Enough time has been wasted, there is much to be done beyond this petty revolt. If you wish for death, so be it.\"\n\nHis hand rose from the table, and upon his motioning Sablin was carried away. The new union would have no room for such foolish men. Utopians, revisionists, and squabbling politicians would no longer be allowed to destroy the dream fought for so long ago. If the Union was to reclaim life from the fascists, it would have to be stronger. This time, he would make sure it was."

 IRK.7.desc: "Genrikh Yagoda had been spending the evening as he usually did, meticulously going over the mountain of reports and dossiers that had accumulated in his office that day. On this occasion, however, the task was not as soul-grinding as usual, for each report painted small fragments of a much larger, optimistic picture: all of Yagoda's plans and hard work were finally coming together. One report stated clearly that any lingering Sablinite influence in Irkutsk had seemingly dissipated for good. It seems that all of the investigations and purges had borne fruit after all. Even now Yagoda couldn't help but feel remnants of anger and betrayal when he thought about the foolish exploits of the mutineers, and how their brazen defiance of the Union caused him so much trouble. At least now he could take comfort in the fact that they would never trouble him again.\n\nAfter some time, he had finally come to the real meat of that evening's reading: the Red Army's reports on combat readiness. What he saw was all the more promising. Not only did High Command report that the military was close to recovering all manpower lost during the mutiny, but also that the subsequent organizational reforms were going through without issue. Intermixed were various updates on the NKVD's espionage efforts into neighboring warlord states, and they had all come back with roughly the same conclusion: the fascists' forces were hopelessly unable to match the Red Army in pitched battle. Once the proper plans of attack had been drawn up, Yagoda anticipated that the coming wars would be a mere triviality assuming the NKVD's reports were accurate.\n\nLighting a cigarette, Yagoda leaned back in his chair and began to think about the future. It was obvious that the war for the interior was coming to a close. From this point onward, his efforts would almost solely be focused on reclaiming whatever was wrestled away from the Soviet Union in its darkest hours. The uphill struggle to take back what was lost would soon begin, and the world would never be the same."

Just watch our own forces try and mobilize that fast. It would be a goddamn circus act!\" Security Chief Bulanov knew that the Field Marshal was mostly joking, but he couldn't help in seeing the hints of some uncomfortable truths in his jest. When the mutiny began, the sheer size of Sablin's army was a cause for great concern amongst both the NKVD and the Red Army's High Command. Bulanov recalled that even General Secretary Yagoda himself was deeply troubled by the mutineers' ability to mobilize so quickly in comparison to his own forces. \"If I had the chance, I'd set about whipping the men back into shape as soon as possible. When the time comes to march against the enemy once more, I don't want to be caught with my pants down again, you know?\" Bulanov nodded in response as he took a drink. \"You should know, Comrade Field Marshal, that Comrade Yagoda had asked for me to open inquiries into the Sablinite war effort. While I do not doubt his stalwart bravery in all things, I do believe he is still somewhat concerned our forces haven't learned anything from the mutiny. What do you think?\"\n\nMaslennikov stopped to think for a moment. When he spoke again, he did so in hushed tones. \"You want to know what I think, comrade? I think that if we were to combine our tactics with that of the mutineers, there would not be a single force from the Urals to Kamchatka that could hold our armies back.\" Perhaps it was because he was just a little drunk, but Bulanov began entertaining the thought that Maslennikov's theory might be necessary.

Was there some kind of problem?\" Maslennikov tried to maintain an air of martial professionalism as he spoke, but his tone betrayed a slight hint of fear. Yagoda stopped and finally looked Maslennikov in the eyes. \"What do I mean? Did you see them? That boy who sneezed looked like he was about to shit himself.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they fear they'll disappoint you, Comrade Yagoda. Rest assured, the soldiers owe you their utmost devotion and loyalty.\" Yagoda was still not impressed, and it showed. \"The only reason they're loyal is because they're terrified of me, not devoted.\" After a pause, the walk continued. \"Do you remember Sablin's traitors, Maslennikov? Those bastards were willing to follow that damn boy into hell when it came to it. I shudder to think how those frightened souls back there would do in similar circumstances.\" The group finally arrived at Yagoda's staff car, and the time came for that afternoon's farewells. \"Make sure the men are in good order next time, Comrade Field Marshal. I will be in touch.\" After an exchange of salutes, Yagoda departed from the base.\n\nThe quiet ride gave Yagoda plenty of time to think. He knew that this problem was far more encompassing than just the army. The entire nation saw him as some kind of monster, despite all their efforts to hide these feelings from the public eye. Meanwhile, that bastard Sablin had transformed his image into that of a hero virtually overnight. Yagoda wondered if perhaps he should make some kind of attempt at softening his image.

This particular morning, they had found themselves in a sleepy cafe in Irkutsk's suburbs, and the subject was dangerously close to becoming more controversial than usual. Bessonov seemed to care little. \"Alexei... do you think that maybe his promises held merit?\" Kosygin immediately halted raising his mug as he heard this, and looked up at Bessonov. \"What are you saying, exactly?\" He said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"His men were willing to lay down their lives for his ideas, fought us tooth and nail.

We have shown the Revolution triumphant once more!\"\n\nPeople began to cheer louder, applause growing in volume and the occasional cheer for Yagoda himself, but the soldiers stomped their boots onto the cold, wooden floor to remind everyone to keep quiet for now and to let the leader speak.\n\n\"But that is not the end of our liberation of Russia, my comrades! Soon, we will march West, we will stomp out any fascists, any monarchists, and anyone who does not support the revolution, this is only the beginning! For now, it is time to party! Go, and be free!\"\n\nThe people cheered once more, louder than ever, as bottles of vodka and other liquor were popped open and people drank wildly, stumbling out into the streets to party. It was truly a day to experience.\n\nYagoda couldn't help but crack a smile as he watched the people cheer for him, and for the Soviet Union."

As we seek to alter our economic policy to fit the tumultuous world of the 1960s, we must turn our eyes to the past and recall what made Bukharin's economy so uniquely successful and innovative.\n\nHis staunch defense (and continuation) of Lenin's New Economic Policy tells us that it is necessary to build up the productive forces of the nation before entering a phase of true socialism. His bold Siberian Plan continues to pay dividends even in this era of anarchy and opportunist warlords, teaching us that we must industrialize even the most rural regions of Russia. His aversion to the collectivisation programs encouraged by some in the Left Opposition shows us that we must not allow ideology to prevent us from pursuing every economic opportunity available.\n\nAs Russians, as Soviets, as socialists, and as members of the Politburo, we are Bukharinists one and all, and proud thereof! As the Soviet Union is reborn by our hand, we must (and shall) adapt a truly Bukharinist model to the needs and wants of the new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and create an economy strong and productive enough to establish socialism no later than 2050!"

On one side of the argument stood the NKVD who, as some of the only loyal forces who had accompanied the Presidium to Irkutsk during the evacuation, claimed that they should be increasingly militarized, to serve as the loyal core of a future army.\n\nOn the other side stood the professional military apparatus of the Red Army itself. They countered strongly by reiterating that they had remained loyal during the Sablinite rebellion, and cast doubt on the combat capability of the NKVD, claiming that to restructure the military to accommodate them would lead to an enormous decrease in both tactical and strategic performance.\n\nNone knew what the outcome of this argument, already underway among the highest echelons of government, would be.

Although they do not ask for formal recognition as the USSR's successor state, the continuity they possess with the old Soviet government makes it an ideal candidate for support from us and makes them a likely candidate for Soviet reunification, and for a potentially powerful ally which can properly face the fascist menace in Europe."

To this end, Lenin created the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics so that even small nationals can express the right of self-determination within the Russian Federative Soviet Republic.\n\nNevertheless, as our borders expand and more ethnic minorities are incorporated within them, the question of whether or not the existing laws on the autonomy of the ASSRs are sufficient has been increasingly raised. The conservative faction claims that the autonomy they exhibit currently (that is, the ability to draft a constitution within the bounds of the national constitution) are enough; critics believe that more autonomy, particularly when it comes to economics, must be given to them to minimize the economic exploitation of these ethnic minorities by the central government."

Yagoda also added that artworks like posters, painting and sculptures will need to be registered with the Bureau as well.\n\n\"Although these measures may seem harsh, these are necessary to preserve socialist freedoms in a world surrounded by capitalists, reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries who seek to undermine and destroy the workers' paradise from within,\" he concluded."

Starting from the next fiscal year, the state will be granting endowments to painters, authors, filmmakers and other artists, with particular focus on socialist realist art that can be easily accessed and understood by the working class in the form of sculptures, murals and films glorifying the struggle of the proletariat from 1917 onwards.

His dinner table never lacked meat, and his new car was never out of gas.\n\nThe car was his proudest purchase. Even with his new salary, he'd had to save up to afford it.

He used to fear that his relaxed attitude towards his work might one day earn him the bullet or the noose, but eventually he'd come to see that his superiors didn't want ambitious and motivated men in the government. They wanted men like Vasily, who were looking to do as little as it took to live comfortably in an uncomfortable world. For almost three decades Vasily had thrived within this cult of mediocrity, content in the certainty that he would be collecting his paycheck until he died. It seemed the new bosses weren't as happy with that idea as Vasily was, as evidenced by the pink slip that now sat on his desk.\n\nIn the coming days Vasily heard from many of his coworkers who had experienced the same thing. No warning or hint that anything is amiss, and then suddenly one day the job you've held since 1938 isn't yours any more.

It would have to do. Boris was not here for a nice office or a good view of Irkutsk. He was here to revitalize the Soviet school system. The last Undersecretary of Revolutionary Education had allowed the Union's schools to fall into stagnation, and thousands of children had been given inadequate educations as a result. Boris was going to put a stop to it. His head was already spinning with ideas and plans of how he would rebuild the Union's schools.\n\nThe first step would be creating a new generation of textbooks, covering everything from the sciences to Russian history. As far as Boris was aware, there hadn't been a new educational text published in Russian since the Great Patriotic War, meaning that any school lucky enough to have textbooks was relying on information that was 30 years old at best. After the textbooks had been printed he could begin organizing a nationwide initiative to train and hire more teachers. After that the foundations would be laid for his most ambitious plans. New schools, both primary and secondary, would open in every city and town across eastern Siberia, heralding a new age of revolutionary schooling and societal progress. Perhaps even a new university to serve as the crowning achievement, or even...\n\nA knock at the office door broke Boris out of his daydreaming. He saw his assistant had returned with a tower of boxes containing the documents and records that Boris needed. Sorting through them all would take all night. Boris sighed, grabbed a box, and dug in. Before he could enjoy the glamour and perks of this job he would have to earn them. \"Oh well,\" he thought. \"Millions have given their lives to the Union. The least I can offer it is my time.\""

The Yagodashchina 一 the long years of political repression carried out by the former NKVD chief 一 is a distant memory, with the orthodox Bukharinist wing of the party firmly back in control of the government. On the ground, people breathe a little easier, as the previously omnipresent NKVD units seemingly disappear from street corners and their imprisoned relatives slowly trickle back from the camps. In the halls of power, bureaucrats rejoice at their luck; the blue-capped reaper has been forever exorcised, and they are no longer the securocrats' hostages.\n\nThe party's historians are hard at work cataloguing and decrying the previous administration's abuses (though perhaps not the ones the new authorities were complicit in). Reams of documents and posters praising Yagoda are quietly destroyed; statues of him, many erected triumphantly only months ago, come down in favor of more palatable statues of Lenin, Marx, or Bukharin.\n\nYagoda's supporters may lament the party coup as a betrayal of socialism and unity, but to the rest of the population his ouster is met with a cautious welcome. It may be the Soviet successor Yagoda built, but without him many believe his ouster is proof that the party can take a kinder path. Those who partook in the revolt have another question to ponder: Valery Sablin is dead, but perhaps he got what he wanted, in the end."

But Pavel was not most people. He took his job as a logistics officer seriously, and this depot was his number one priority. Nothing came in or out of it without him making a record of it. Except now something had, because this week he counted 50 IFVs and last week there were only 45.\n\nThere were more MBTs as well, but that did not concern him. He had seen the truck that brought them in, signed off on the paperwork, and told the driver here he could find a good drink in the nearest town. He had expected 38 MBTs, but he could not explain the five extra IFVs and that bothered him. Where had they come from? Why were they here? Had they been sent here on accident, or had someone forgot to tell him about a delivery? Pavel was going to get answers.\n\nHe burst into the depot guard's office, startling the guard on duty there. \"Comrade, I need to see the records from the last week at once please.\"\n\nThe guard looked at Pavel for a moment before speaking \"I'm sorry Comrade Sergeant but I can't give them to you. I've been ordered not to allow anyone to see those records.\"\n\n\"By who?\" Pavel bellowed. \"I have authority over this depot! It is my responsibility!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry Sergeant but they ordered me not to say anything. I didn't get their IDs anyway.

A sigh left his mouth for what was the sixth time today, as he thought about how things were becoming.\n\nTraffic was terrible, and the NKVD checkpoints were stifling as always. By the time he had finally made it to the Presidium, he had decided - something needed to be done. Even if Yagoda had eyes everywhere, even if he only grew stronger by the day, he needed to do something. But first, he needed to rally the others.\n\n...After he got past the guard at the door, who kept looking at him and shaking his head, while blocking his path. \"Comrade Bessonov, while your service to the Union has been faithful and an admirable example, I cannot let you pass.\" Sergey blinked. \"And just why not?\" He asked as the officer blinked, confused.\n\n\"Comrade, you were promoted to the Bureau of Agricultural Advisory. Another representative has been selected...\" Sergey barely heard the rest; was that why he hadn't been informed of the meeting? A promotion. He had been \"promoted\", as had the others no doubt. Funneled off, moved out of power, and shuffled to where they could not even touch him. Where the thought of Sergey Bessonov moving against Genrikh Yagoda wasn't just laughable, it was nonexistent.\n\nAnd so, as Sergey Bessonov began to sob, and the guard confusedly looked around unsure of what to do, the General Secretary gave a single passing, small smile from the window before striding into the chamber of the Presidium, not even bothering to glance back at the entrance."

And so far, both had not found much yet. \"You're certain you have no recollection of where these missing funds have gone.\" Nikolai spoke calmly, as he eyed a brief set of files. \"Does this imply incompetence on your part, or does this imply a colleague's responsibility?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the Bureaucrat began, after a brief gulp. \"I'm fairly certain I saw Gennady skulking around -\" Anatonly raised a hand, cutting him off. \"Comrade, Gennady stated he saw you skulking around in the evening; in fact, he promptly filed a report implicating you as a suspect instead of waiting until now to divulge this. Tell me, why would you wait to divulge such crucial suspicions until you were filed into a room for questioning?\"\n\nA brief pause filled the air, as Nikolai looked up from his files pointedly. \"My colleague asked you a question.\" He boredly stated, as the burecrat slowly looked to them - then the door. For a moment, he looked like he was going to attempt to run.\n\nThis moment ended when a pistol was whipped against the side of his face, while Nikolai reached to a small bag at the side of his chair, withdrawing tools.

I recognize that you have every right to be angry with me for a single moment of weakness. However, I have repented entirely from my heinous actions. You may doubt, you may disbelieve, but I initially took the funds to be used elsewhere, to benefit the Union in different departments.\n\nI see however, that my idealism did not bear the fruit I had thought I would sow. Instead, I entered into a den of ruffians, corrupt monsters, and those who would seek to bring the revolution astray. Thankfully, two brave and intrepid investigators aided in my repentance with a brief visit to my home, in which I realized how far I had been led astray.\n\nTo ask for forgiveness is a challenge, though I offer this. In exchange for amnesty, I will fully cooperate and give the names and addresses of those I know who are involved in the den of bourgeoise corruption.

All the conspirators have been arrested or dealt with, and-\"\n\n\"Anatoly, shut up and let me talk to the General Secretary.\" The other voice spoke, as a brief bit of murmuring between the two was heard. \"Right, Nikolai reporting. We have three dead conspirators, one dead officer, two injured officers. One attempted to flee and was shot, one attempted to kill the men sent to investigate him, and the Junior Lieutenant thought that the third conspirator had nothing to say.\"\n\n\"He was reaching for a gun.\" Anatoly muttered across the line, as Genrikh sighed. \"The informant?\"\n\n\"Resettled to Chita and given a small stipend for his time, far more generous than the others in the embezzlement scandal will get.

It could be books, it could be films, it could be anything the Japanese were making.\n\nAnd it was all jotted down on a single, small little paper list that was placed down on his desk every morning. Sometimes it was simply a copy, while other times it was a new one. By this point, every day was the same to Armen - he'd wake up, eat breakfast, bid a goodbye to his wife, go to work, and return home in the late hours of the night.\n\nA cog. That's what he was. A simple gear in the apparatus of state, working day and night for a pension he never seemed to have the time to use. More items were labeled, more items were censored, and the list always arrived at his desk. His wife tried to understand, and he and his coworkers occasionally went out for drinks, but he would always find himself at this desk, accepting orders from above and relaying them down below with little fanfare. An easily replaceable cog, if he stepped out of line- some of his coworkers had already vanished and been replaced.\n\nPerhaps Irina and him should take a vacation - a single brief respite. He owed it to her, after all. Yes. As he lay in his bed for the evening, his wife asleep on the other end, he realized a vacation was exactly what they needed. Tomorrow, when he was done with his shift, he would ask for time off. So, he went forth the next morning with a large smile, stepped into his cubicle, and eyed the piece of paper already laid on his desk.\n\nThe list had been doubled."

Such a system naturally eroded public confidence in the socialist ideal of equal justice, and encouraged corruption besides. No longer.\n\nAt the personal insistence of General Secretary Yagoda the entire system is to be professionalized. Strict guidelines for required qualifications will be developed, systems of licensing examined and overhauled, if necessary, and present officials found to be unqualified removed. In this fashion, the legitimacy of Soviet justice will be ensured, in the eyes of both the people and the world. The State must have a competent, effective, and unbiased socialist judiciary.\n\nAnd the State is, of course, what Genrikh Yagoda says it is."

At the very least, Viktor could say that he was employed and his family was well fed.\n\nViktor took his position on the line and began the monotonous job of assembling artillery shells. Hours passed him by with little incident, and yet he could not help but think that something was different. It was a small thing, easily able to be missed on the line, but something was different.\n\nAfter another few hours he understood, the line had been going much faster than it had been before. A few words exchanged with his foreman cleared things up well. Apparently, as the foreman relayed to him, some of the inspection points had been eliminated in favor of a more efficient pace for production. He couldn't help but have mixed feelings about these new changes. As the day dragged on he felt like he was falling behind. At first, the new pace was easy to handle, but the further on the day went the worse he felt.\n\nAs he left the plant at the end of the day, he could not help but worry about the quality of some of his work."

And yet, when it finally happened, even he was taken by surprise.\n\nThe early-morning meeting of the Central Committee had actually been called by Yagoda himself, intending to address a series of military and diplomatic incidents along the southern border with Manchuria. However, shortly after it had commenced, he found himself the victim of intense criticism by other members for his supposed 'encouragement of friction within the socialist framework.'\n\nHaving purged many opponents himself over the years, Yagoda knew immediately that he was finished, outmaneuvered yet again. The vote, unanimous of course and as required for a public showing of unity, was a formality. It was over. Still, and facing political oblivion, he found himself unable to stand from the table's head.\n\nHe was suddenly helped to his feet by the strong arms of two Red Army sergeants - no doubt called by Malik using a small device he could see attached to the inside of the man's jacket - and forcefully directed from the room.\n\nAs he was hustled into the central vehicle in a small convoy and driven out of the city at great speed, he could hear the radio announcing the appointment of Sergey Alexeyvich Bessonov as General Secretary, to be replaced with Alexei Kosygin as Premier. That morning, he had been General Secretary Yagoda, and now he was only Comrade Yagoda, destined for internal exile in some remote town where he could do no harm, and be closely watched besides.\n\nHe supposed that he should be thankful.

These soviets will be given authority - within reason - to determine local economic and production goals, tailored to the particulars and relative resources of their province.\n\nThe decisions made by the sovnarkhozy, and the particulars resulting from them, will be consolidated by the central government. Analysis will be subsequently performed by the State Planning Committee, in order to ensure both more efficient economic planning and more realistic production goals year-over-year.\n\nAlthough basic need for the sovnarkhozy has been questioned by some who claim it an unneeded dilution of state authority, both local and national Party officials have made clear their their view of the individual sovnarkhoz as being 'wholly in tune with the socialist spirit of cooperation at all levels.'\n\nTime will tell if such devolution proves beneficial."

When he had seen the advertisement - positions available for junior state planners - his father had told him not to bother. Such jobs went to men of connection, he had said, not men such as him.\n\nBut Morozov was a true believer in the inherent equality of socialism, and he would not be deterred. He wanted to serve his country and its citizens, and he knew he was capable of doing so.\n\nThe men who had controlled things for so long were not only old, they were, largely, not even from Siberia. Irkutsk was not Moscow, and Siberia was not Western Russia. The lands, the challenges, and the people were different, and the new Union required new administrators if it was to prosper and combat the reactionaries, despots, and occupiers that still held most of Russia in their grasp.\n\nWhen he returned home the evening after submitting his application package, having waited five hours in line to do so, and said as much, his father had only scowled. A waste of time, he was told. But as he went to sleep that night, Morozov felt certainty in his future. He would be given his opportunity.\n\nAfter all, the Party had promised equality."

University had taught him that, apart from political reliability, little was more important to a state than its economy. And for the Union, that economy, down to the last sack of corn, was controlled from here.\n\nHe could tell, however, that he was not going to be welcomed by many. The looks that followed him from the senior planners told him as much. But he would not be intimidated. He had been taught in the Komsomol that change was always resisted by those who had accumulated power and, sadly, even once-committed socialists were not immune to perpetuating such resistance.\n\nWhen he was shown to his 'office,' a repurposed broom closet with little more than a rough-hewn desk, a mismatched chair, and a plastic telephone, he knew that those looks had been followed by deeds. But he would respond in kind.\n\nLooking at the stacks of graphs, reports, and production figures that had been stacked in the corner, he felt power run through him. He would learn the Union's economic anatomy. He would diagnose illness. And he would prescribe treatment. The Party demanded loyalty, yes, but it also required the competence that he possessed.\n\nIt was time to get to work."

Many were from his university. Or other similar ones. And all, including himself, were close in age. With them changed the atmosphere of the Gosplan office as a whole. Unlike the lethargy that had once dominated it, and had started to get to him once initial excitement had worn off, there was now a collective energy and drive that he was proud to be part of.\n\nProblems that had existed for years were solved through collective innovation. Production pipelines were optimized. Industries were integrated, horizontally and vertically. Workers were reassigned and relocated to maximize skill overlaps. Sources of waste, human or otherwise, were pursued, identified, and ruthlessly eliminated. And with every improvement, the overall projections improved. Things had begun to change, indeed.\n\nThe senior planners no longer looked at him and the other young arrivals with disdain. No, now they looked at them with fear. They knew that things were changing, that the Party had seen the value of bringing a new generation of administrators into the fold.

A peace had come over the aging murderer, a peace he refused to vacate.\n\nHis eyes turned to the green waters before him, taking their time to meet the sunkissed horizon. Below it, he saw the faint outlines of Nerpa seals, unique little fishermen who frequently found themselves pestered by birds.\n\nIn many ways he related to the birds. He was, like them, a pest. While the people of Irkutsk city attempted to carve out lives in this Russian hell, Ilya harassed them. In his head sat thousands of words, snippets of conversations between lovers, friends, families. All of them were stolen, private snapshots of lives acquired via surveillance.\n\nUpon his hands there was much blood. Young and old, idealist and cynic, patriot and traitor. Each had met with Ilya's justice at one time or another.\n\nHe laughed quietly at the dramatic tone of his thoughts. What had made the Sablinites any different?

 IRK_superregional.3.desc: "Genrikh Yagoda restlessly tapped his pen on his desk. The numbers weren't adding up, and he had done all he could reasonably be expected to do in order to make them do so.\n\nHe frowned. Money was missing from the budget, too much for it to be a mere error. The perpetrator had done little to nothing to cover his tracks, likely expecting to get away with it due to his rank.\n\nHad he not been clear that the years of corruption were over? That fraud would no longer be tolerable in his government? That transgressions against the legitimacy of the state would be met with death?\n\nPerhaps he had been too merciful in the past, too lenient to truly send the correct message. Yes, if there was one thing that Comrade Yagoda knew was true of himself, it was that he was a merciful man. Anyone else in his position who was looking out over the seditious world he ruled over would have burned it all down.\n\nHis old bony fingers spun the phone dial and he lifted the receiver to his ear.\n\n\"Yes, chairman?\" asked his secretary.\n\n\"There's a man we need to make an example of,\" Comrade Yagoda said, without joy, but only with duty."

 IRK_superregional.4.desc: "Allowing foreign interests into our territory has done wonders towards restoring our capabilities as an industrial nation! We're reaping the benefits of an increased economic base while also greatly improving conditions for the actual citizenry.\n\nWith foreign interests paying our workers higher than average wages, and the increased wealth allowing us to spend more on social programs, it's becoming clear that a nascent middle class is beginning to form, and will soon be a thriving aspect of our nation!\n\nDie-hard socialists at home might complain about our hypocrisy at allowing the capitalists into our nation, and the newly arrived foreigners grumble about the intense policing and supervision in our state - but none can argue that the policy has been successful."
 IRK_superregional.4.a: "It's better to have a rich oppressed nation than a poor oppressed nation."
 IRK_superregional.5.t: "The Red Phoenix"
 IRK_superregional.5.desc: "The first major attempt at animation in our nation since the Great Patriotic War has been distributed today to state theatres as part of our ongoing propaganda campaign to remind people of Comrade Yagoda's benevolence.\n\nThe film, titled: Red Phoenix, has struck a chord with the Russian people.\n\nThe film stars an old red phoenix, once mighty, with a face resembling Comrade Bukharin being chased through a quiet and friendly Siberian town before ultimately being struck down by a crude and bumbling caricature of Adolf Hitler. For ten minutes of screentime, villagers are shown to be in a miserable state as Hitler and his Nazis rampage through town. Just when all seems lost, the phoenix rises again, now resembling Comrade Yagoda, and throws the Nazis out, to the cheers and adoration of the town.\n\nThe animation is only 38 minutes long, and foreign observers have derided it as being decades out of date artistically speaking. They may be right, as it most resembles the relatively crude propaganda films that had come out of Japan in the mid 40's, save that the Russian animators had taken special care to ensure that the colour red was in the film, even if the rest of it was black and white.\n\nRegardless of what the foreigners think, it's a hit, and the masses are clearly warming up to Yagoda's cult of personality."
 IRK_superregional.5.a: "With what we've been through, any animation industry at all is a feat unto itself."
 IRK_superregional.6.t: "Freedom of Speech, Not Freedom from Consequence"
 IRK_superregional.6.desc: "\"You'll forgive us for not trusting you!\" yelled a man in the crowd to the USSR rep who had been sent to the village.\n\nPyoter, was the dissident man's name, according to Kirill's local informant, and so Kirill scribbled the man's name into his NKVD notebook.\n\n\"Yes,\" yelled the representative in reply. \"Yes I do forgive you. The new USSR is not the old one. We are FOR the people, well and truly! We encourage all of you to speak your minds!\"\n\n\"We all see through your registry scheme, comrade! You just want information on us so we can easily be rounded up!\" cried a woman, and Kirill wrote her name down too.\n\n\"We DO want to know who and where you are, comrades, but only to know how better to serve you! So we can better know where to distribute your food and any goods you may need,\" the rep said with an honest smile. \"And I know you do not trust me, but I swear to you that this is a new USSR! One where freedom of speech and open dialogue is a protected right! If you need any more evidence of this, consider that the old government would have NEVER allowed you to speak to a party member in this way. Please, comrades, fill out your registry information and do not be afraid to speak, for you are, each of you, safe in your nation!\"\n\nKirill smiled as the townspeople reluctantly filed out to the registration tents that had been set up. He flipped his notebook shut and handed it to one of the other plainclothes NKVD agents who was present.\n\n\"Round up all those who spoke out, make sure no one knows it's you,\" Kyrill ordered. His lips curled into a wicked grin."

 IRK_superregional.7.desc: "Genrikh Yagoda watched the lights flicker in his office. Re-industrialization was going well, but the old systems that had yet to be replaced and rewired were still nothing to rely on.\n\nOutdated or not, the fact that so much of his territory had power at all was a testament to his success.\n\nHe reached over his reports to drink from a glass of cool water, enjoying the feeling as it chilled his throat and mouth.\n\nSo much success, and they had come so close, within mere inches of losing it all in the uprising of the 'leninist' turncoat, Valery Sablin.\n\nIt was a defining moment for the USSR, the greatest challenge she had ever faced.\n\nHe remembered the day he received the report. For an instant, a single instant of coldblooded panic and hopeless terror, Genrikh thought he could understand what old Bukharin felt the day they told him that the Wehrmacht had invaded.\n\nGenrikh wasn't there that day, but he had informants who were. They said Bukharin had shrivelled when he heard - wilting like a flower before an inferno.\n\nAnd so, when Yagoda faced the same circumstance, the same test of will - staring national downfall in the face - he knew that he could not flounder as Bukharin had done. Yagoda remained strong, remained composed, and patiently moved to handle the upstart.\n\nGenrikh smiled. It was the first of many tests of his resurgent nation, but there were many more to come. He took pen in hand and returned to his paperwork once more, renewed in his will to succeed."

 IRK_superregional.8.desc: "In a rare and welcome upset to Soviet politics, Sergey Bessonov has continued to pleasantly surprise his nation in sticking to his promised reforms to create a less oppressive USSR. Though the NKVD has been grumbling quietly about it, it's unlikely that such an organization would protest publicly at the changes, nor does it seem likely that they'll make a move against the party now that stability has finally started to return to the nation.\n\nBessonov drafted legislation this morning to do something unthinkable to many, ending the gulag labour camps and put an end to a nearly forty year old institution of national repression.\n\nTo alleviate concerns that dangerous dissidents are being released out into the nation, Bessonov has arranged for a fair retrial of the forced labourers based upon the modern enforcement of the law rather than the harsh policies of Yagoda.\n\nOther critics have pointed out that the end of the gulags will cripple the state's ability to build infrastructure or other large projects, but the party insists that anything built on the backs of slave labour is not worth being built.\n\nOn the other hand, former prisoners are being formally offered jobs and good wages to continue working in 'construction camps,' though it's unknown how many will take up this offer in favour of leaving the entire nightmare behind."

It was a mass-produced thing that was unworthy of him. And as if the entire matter wasn't insulting enough, the \"paperwork\" in question, upon a brief look, seemed to be utterly unimportant reports confirming grain shipments to and from irrelevant and impoverished villages on the far fringes of civilization!\n\n\"Comrade! I am a member of the Nomenklatura!\" he bellowed in anger.\n\n\"Yes you are,\" agreed the bureaucrat with a polite nod. \"Now have those reports on my desk by 6 PM.\""

 IRK_superregional.10.t: "Investigating the Personality Cult"
 IRK_superregional.10.desc: "The Bessonov administration has spent perhaps more time than might have been thought strictly necessary investigating the cult of personality that Genrikh Yagoda had built for himself. Among other things, a series of rejected propaganda photos which involved a shirtless Yagoda hunting, fishing, and riding on horseback through the wilderness have been passed around with great amusement between the party members.\n\nThe effects of the cult surrounding Yagoda, however, are no laughing matter, as they allowed him to act as an unimpeded dictator that could step over the proletariat as though they were his personal slaves without any fear of retaliation or checks on his power.\n\nAfter the party was finished cackling at a picture of Yagoda holding a leopard (once again, while shirtless,) they elected to prevent such a thing from happening again.\n\nClarifications were made to the public as to what the old administration had been lying about, as well warning the public to never throw away their ability to think skeptically, even when it's the government speaking.\n\nAdditionally, limits were introduced, among other precautions, about how much could be written or broadcast about the chairmen or other important politicians compared to other news topics, to prevent any temptation on the part of future chairmen to force the state media to fixate upon him."

 IRK_superregional.11.desc: "The crowds flooding into Ulan-Ude Opera House last night were record breaking as local singer Dominika Kuznetsova performed the first wholly original work of operatic music in nearly twenty years.\n\nThe performance drew in both the frequent opera goers as well as the old enthusiasts who'd grown bored of the same shows and songs being performed week after week. The performance itself was a hit, and while the piece is not considered to be one of the all-time greats of Russian music, it was certainly a welcome new addition.\n\nKuznetzova herself has declined to reveal the identity of the songwriter, insisting that \"He would like to remain anonymous.\" Whoever he is, it's clear that Buryat would like to hear more of his work.\n\nAs if to spoil the fun, a recent arrival in the city, who claims to have resided in Tomsk up until recently, insists that the piece is a rip off of an identical piece of music that had been composed and presented in Tomsk, but merely with a few 'awkward sounding' changes to make the piece sound less subversive to the communist government.\n\nBeing that the work stumbles at a few strange places, despite flowing beautifully elsewhere - it could be that he's right."

Of course, his actions were not uncommon, for it had been repeated across the city. Many mourned for the Central Siberian Republic, and for the dream of democracy.\n\nThat, however, were not the only reasons the man drank, for he was a Humanist politician in the Central Siberian Republic, and he lost more than the dream of democracy. No, for his political career as a Humanist went up in flames along with Tomsk's ideals, and unless he accepted the offer gave by the Government in Irkutsk, he may be forced to live in a cold prison cell. Or worse.\n\nBut that would involve betraying his ideals, for Irkutsk was the complete opposite of all his ideals. They did not support the ideas of democracy, their leaders were the same men that oppressed his former Humanist colleagues, and their leader is a raving despot. For him to even think about accepting their \"generous\" offer, he would have to swallow his pride whole.\n\nBut are his pride and ideals really worth more than his life?\n\nSwallowing the remainder of the wine he had in his hand, the man swore and dialed the phone."

But Sergei did, and while the other might have complained that it was a waste of resources while the USSR had more important matters to attend to, the truth had been that Bessonov's reforms had built a strong, united, and motivated nation, quite unlike the reluctant police state he had inherited from his predecessor.\n\nGenrikh Yagoda.\n\nBessonov felt his fists curl up in anger at the memories. Socialism was meant to serve the people, not oppress them, and yet to the tyrant-in-chief, the people were nothing more than slaves to his state machinery. So much was at stake with the flourishing state they had preserved here in the far east, and thanks to Yagoda, most of it had been lost or compromised to rebellions.\n\nBessonov promised he would prove himself better, and today he was finally certain that he had done so. But Bessonov had made another promise too, one that would be a lifelong endeavor.\n\nNo one like Yagoda would ever rise to power again."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_BESSONOV_DESC: "A career Soviet politician, diplomat, and Communist Party official, as well as a staunch Bukharinist besides, Sergey Alexeyevich Bessonov followed along with the evacuation of government from Moscow during the German invasion. Remaining with the core of the Presidium, despite numerous defections and splinters, he settled with the others in Irkutsk, where his diplomatic experience earned him a position as Foreign Minister within General Secretary Yagoda's cabinet.\n\nHowever, Bessonov grew increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda's approach to governance, and in particular strongly opposed his concentration of power towards the State faction and away from the Communist Party - the natural font of authority in any true Bukharinist state. As the power struggle between the Party and Yagoda's clique deepened, Bessonov knew where his loyalties lay, and when the time was right to depose Yagoda and once again empower the Party, he stood ready to play his part.\n\nNamed Premier by the grateful Presidium after Yagoda's fall, Bessonov moved quickly to eject Yagoda supporters and loyalists from positions of authority, replacing them with reliable Party officials. He intends fully to return the Presidium and the Union back to their Bukharinist roots, and in so doing, decisively - and permanently - dismantle the so-called 'Yagodaschina.'"

Alisa, bless her soul, worried about his own restlessness, even if she tried to hide it. If he knew Yagoda though, and he did, all too well, then he was not the one she should be worried about. Their son was in greater danger than most people could imagine.\n\nAs Boldyrev was reading a book early in the night, trying to calm himself and finally get some sleep, a knock came. He nearly fell on the floor trying to get up, and ran so quickly to the door he feared he might trip. When he reached the door and opened it, however, the excitement on his face vanished. This was not his son. This was an NKVD officer, his stare cold and unfeeling. \"A letter, for you, comrade.\" Boldyrev opened it, fear quickly building down to his very bones. It was a letter, one first thanking him for his years of service to the NKVD. Then it went on to explain that his son's body had been discovered at the site of the final capture of Sablin, identified by old NKVD friends of Boldyrev who had known his son as a child. It was signed by Yagoda personally. Boldyrev collapsed to his knees, tears streaming out of his eyes, which stared after the retreating back of the NKVD officer. It was useless, utterly useless. Nobody could oppose Yagoda, god damn his name, yet he had been foolish enough to let his son try. It was a choice he would regret for the rest of his days.

Avoiding the mistake of taking a great leap forward, we'll limit the reform package to opening up parts of Irkutsk's central areas to foreign investments and provide generous legal and tax incentives to attract foreign capital with the state driving the push towards a service-based economic model for the city."

 IRK_yakutia_special_economic_province_desc: "Back during the early days of the NEP's implementation it wasn't unheard of for British and Japanese mining companies to invest in the Soviet Union. Yagoda believes that with the right tax incentives, Yakutia could become a hotbed for foreign mining companies seeking to establish themselves on Soviet soil. Naturally, we'll make sure that our most important strategic resources remain firmly under the control of the State."

Opening up Blagoveshchensk as a SES would thus be an ideal move, allowing us to expand our economy while also signaling our intentions to improve our ties with Japan. By allowing Japanese Zaibatsu to establish themselves in the city, we can turn it into one of Asia's great industrial hubs."

The success of the Yagodaschina cannot be denied by anyone, for it was this measured approach to economics that not only saw our Union prosper again, but also allowed us to reclaim another portion of our Soviet Motherland from its illegitimate occupants. Now the time has come to launch an even more ambitious Five Year Plan - one that shall see us restore Soviet control throughout the Russian anarchy and beyond."

That being said, as long as they're just merely under the ground it's hardly of any use to us.

It demonstrated the willingness of the revolutionaries to not merely punish tyranny - but actively purge it.

No, we will design a detailed project for the phased creation of a full-fledged developed infrastructure in those lands, with the construction of bridges, tunnels, telecommunication and power lines, repair and fuel stations, all while keeping in mind extreme temperature fluctuations, harsh weather and hostile environment.

The most talented of these newcomers will be appointed to the governing positions in the Far East, along with the competent and experienced personnel we already have.

It's time to put an end to this and restore the financial system of the Soviet Union.\n\nFirstly, all banking and financial institutes in the liberated territories will be integrated back into the structure of the Gosbank of the USSR and brought into line with its standards. Secondly, instead of numerous false currencies, a single Soviet Ruble will be re-issued, as the only legal currency on the territory of the USSR, and Gosbank will organize a quick and massive exchange of people's savings into the new currency. Finally, for the survival and development of the Soviet economy, it will be necessary to restore trade contacts with foreign countries, which means that the Soviet Ruble must be backed with internationally accepted resources: gold and silver.

The Far East belongs to the United Soviet Socialist Republics, just as it did all those years ago.\n\nUnder Yagoda's guidance, we have finally begun to wake up from the nightmare imposed on us by the German monstrosity. Only flickering phantasmagoria remain: fascist holdouts, tsarist enclaves, and Sablinites in need of reeducation.

 IRK.78.desc: "There are many versions of the death of Father Alexander Men.\n\nIn the official accounts, Father Men was seized by the patriotic forces of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet after a small struggle and an attempted escape. In accordance with the Union's policies and procedures, he was brought before a tribunal, judged for his crimes against the state, and sentenced to death by firing squad. He struggled and wept as he was ushered outside to his doom. As befitting a traitor to the Revolution, his final words were not recorded.\n\nAs told by the heirs of Harbin, Alexander Men led a great and valiant battle against the thuggish militias of Irkutsk. Though he fought bravely, the vile communists outnumbered the righteous priest and his company. They seized and tortured him. They delivered him to a group of secret police, who demanded he recant his Christian faith. When the troublesome priest failed to break, they disposed of him via firing squad. His last words were a condemnation of Marx and all his allies.\n\nStill, there is another story told in the nameless villages of Siberia. In this version, Alexander Men was not seized. He participated in no glorious battles, no attempted escapes. Rather, seeing the devastation wrought by the fighting done in his name, Alexander Men surrendered himself to the forces of Irkutsk. He came peacefully before a tribunal and said nothing as they condemned him for his crimes. Before the doors to the courtroom opened, before soldiers ushered the village priest to his oblivion, Alexander Men rose from his seat. Standing in his dark, mud-stained robes, he took a moment to stare at his captors. Then, he left them with one final message."

Before him stood the prominent leader of the Yakutsk government; Basharin, Okhlopov, and many corporate figures were all captured and made to stand trial. It was clear from the start that the Yakutians were at a disadvantage. Witnesses all harangued the corporate figures for their greediness and lack of care for the workers who toiled in the mines.\n\nThen the corporate figures tried to defend themselves, to no avail. Every time they opened their mouth, they would get shouted down by the jury, the witnesses, or the judge himself.\n\nAfter hours of the court session, the verdict was clear. The Yakutians would be shot for counter-revolutionary behavior. They were escorted to a wall behind the court, lined up to the wall, and shot before their bodies were stacked on the back of a truck and sent to a communal grave.\n\nSeveral trials similar to this followed. The Presidium tried all of the members of the Yakutian Assembly for secessionism; of course, they were found guilty. Over half of them were executed, and the rest had the fate of being exiled to the frozen gulags."

Rough dirt roads had made the ride up north bumpy, and both men were happy to finally stretch their legs. They had driven into the remote area of Yakutsk and now found themselves experiencing its features.\n\nKosygin commented on the situation. \"So this is one of our new state-owned Diamond mines. It's, homely.\"\n\nLooking at their surroundings, the two witnessed the old mine in all its faded beauty. Contrasted with the rest of the place, Kosygin's eyes were fixed on a freshly painted sign reading YakAlmaz Kombinat where some other name had once stood. Meanwhile, Yagoda stayed fixated on a man with a helmet, slowly walking towards them in the snow.\n\nThe identity of the man turned out to be that of the mine's foreman. Excitedly he greeted the two and showed them around. They saw the equipment, the mines, a few of the diamonds extracted, and even a side area designated for lumber.\n\nWhat they saw was disappointing, but expected. Much of the mine was not in operation, and short of workers. Still, it was an ongoing process and Kosygin gained an idea of what to provide for future operations. Similarly, Yagoda took pride in the leadership of the operation. All party loyalists, with not a spec of the old companies, left.\n\nAs the tour ended, the manager and two men exchanged pleasantries, thanking each other for their presence and contributions respectively. Piling into the car, Kosygin and Yagoda heard the characteristic hum of the engine. For a moment they relaxed, but it was brief. They had a long road ahead of them and it was rough."

 manul.1.desc: "フローレンティーはその仕事に疲れながらも、ウラン＝ウデからチタまでを通る道に沿って歩いていた。彼は今週、不運にも部隊の中で不発弾を調べる任務を割り当てられたのだ。今日は最後の日であり、まだ命が惜しかったし、早くこの仕事を次の哀れなヤツに回したかった。\n\n退屈だった。彼は石を蹴って、それが飛び上がって視界から消えるまで目で追った。すると、彼は物珍しそうにそれが落ちた場所へと進んだ。近づいて、砲弾の作った穴を見下ろした。最初は不安だったが、命令がもうないことにホッとした。事務仕事から解放されるのだ。\n\n彼が後ろを向き警戒に戻ろうとしたところで、その穴の中からか弱い声が聞こえた。危険だとは分かっていたが、彼はその声の主を探すために穴の中へと入った。声が聞こえた場所へと近づいて行くと、驚きの余り手から銃を落としてしまった。小さい割れ目の中に、ふわふわしていて、今まで見た中で最も可愛らしいマヌルたちがいたのだ。\n\nフローレンティーはその赤ちゃん猫の可愛らしい眼差しに見つめられて、ほぼ本能に従って近づいていった。しかしそこに着く前に、穴の中、奥深くからものすごい威嚇が聞こえてきた。覗いてみると、二つの輝いた目が殺す準備ができているかのように彼を見上げていた。彼は怯え、その恐怖のままに銃も拾わず穴から飛び出てしまった。\n\n一方、その目の主は子供の元へと歩み寄った。子供たちは最大限に安全で元気があり、自らに降りかかっている危険を知らないようだった。母が子供たちに寄り添っていると、穴の外から大きな爆発が聞こえて、母は少し気を取られてしまった。しかし音が消えるとすぐに子供の方を向いて、何事もなかったかのように振る舞った。"

 manul.2.desc: "ブリヤートの森は、めったにない平和な瞬間の中で静かにたたずんでいた。ゲラシムは、かつて故郷の小さな村だった小さな停留所からウラン＝ウデとチタを結ぶ鉄道の線路沿いに歩いていた。薪を割る仕事から解放された彼は、木々には何が見えるのだろうと思いながら、林冠のあたりを見渡した。\n\n視線を下に移すと、二つのものが目に飛び込んできた。一つは地雷を踏んでしまった不運な奴のずたずたの死体。もう一つは彼の行く先からすぐそばにある砲弾の穴だ。その時、彼は眼下にあるものと何か関係があると感じ、自分のより良い判断に反して下へと降りていった。\n\n底に着いたとき、彼はそこで見たものに驚いた。その場しのぎの巣穴には、無垢なマヌルネコたちが住み着いていたのだ。もっとよく見ようと、彼は赤ん坊に近づいた。しかし、母親が子供たちと自分たちの間に立ち、身構えながら唸るのを見て、彼は立ち止まった。\n\nゲラシムが最初の反応は恐怖ではなく、むしろクスクス笑いであった。面白い、と彼は思った。その獰猛な性格は、彼の昔の妻ユーリヤを思い出させた。彼女の気性にはいつも彼が気をつけなければならなかった。しかし、その光景についてより深く考えるにつれ、深い悲しみが彼を満たした。最後に彼女を見たのは、シベリア戦争の最中、娘たちをかばっている姿だった。彼女は飛んでくる砲弾に対して、どうすることもできなかった。\n\nすっかり落ち込んでしまったゲラシムは、母親が自分を気にしなくなるまで、ゆっくりと離れていった。ようやく姿が見えなくなると、彼はゆっくりと砲弾の穴から抜け出し、目に涙を浮かべながら急いで町へ戻った。彼は過去を忘れるために散歩をしていたのであって、思い出すために散歩をしていたのではなかった。"

 manul.3.t: "Casualties of Progress"
 manul.3.desc: "BZZZZZ! She opened her groggy green eyes as she awoke from her slumber. Tired, she had spent much of the previous afternoon hunting and had slept late. Reluctantly, she stretched herself awake. She had seen some strange things in the last few days, but the noise was new.\n\nWalking out of her cave, she squinted at the sight of the sun over Lake Baikal. She always hated the morning light, it was why she slept in so late, at least when she was disturbed by loud noises. Yet, as her eyes adjusted to the light, what she saw confused her. The dam on the lake seemed bigger, boxes and machinery had been moved in front of her cave, and the boots of the humans marched around like they owned the place.\n\nBOOM! The loud noise startled the manul, causing her to sprint out in a commotion. Turning around, she saw her former home destroyed, as the roof collapsed in from the explosives of a construction crew. Yet at the same time, confused workers looked at the isolated manul, now left vulnerable out in the open.\n\nFrightened, she ran east through the camp. She weaved through the machinery and boxes around her now unfamiliar surroundings. Recognizing a stretch of woods, she stopped as she analyzed the best way through the remaining construction. However, her contemplation was short-lived as the sound of a missed shot rang out next to her. Terrified, the manul bolted forward, leaping out of the camp and into the comparative safety of the wild.\n\nShe continued running until she could hear the men and see the construction no more. Relieved at her safety, she collapsed on the ground, rolling in the dirt screeching. Yet her relief was short-lived as she realized the circumstances of her situation. A new home would need to be found, all over again."

 manul.4.t: "Into the Wild"
 manul.4.desc: "Yaroslav quietly crouched down and inspected a set of small footprints leading deeper into the woods. They were fresh, he was getting closer he thought. With a net in one hand and a small cage in the other, He had been wandering around the woods south of Novosibirsk for the last few days. However, the exhausted hunter was sure that his chase would soon be at an end.\n\nAs he crossed a stream, Yaroslav let out a sigh. Titan might have paid well, but he seriously questioned his decision to take the job. After all, manuls were not uncommon. Indeed, surely there were places they could buy one for their zoo? Then again, maybe it was just a desire for quality, and maybe again he was not the only unlucky bastard doing this given the zoo's ever-expanding size.\n\nSetting foot on the other bank, he could make out more tracks, now leading to a cave. As he got closer, Yaroslav's eyes widened as he finally got a look at his target. The large fluff ball was just sitting outside licking its fur. Carefully, he approached, keeping his eyes locked on his target. Unfortunately for him, the sound of a branch under his boot ruined his plan.\n\nLocking eyes, Yaroslav began running towards the manul hoping to corner it in its cave. The plan worked as the manul retreated into the cave, but only for a moment. From the darkness, the frightening manul leaped at Yaroslav climbing up his leather jacket in a run for his face.\n\nYet, he had come prepared for this. Thinking quickly, he dropped the cage and grabbed it by the neck with his newly freed hand. Now confused, the manul found itself swooped up in a net before being thrown into the small cage on the floor. Yaroslav breathed a sigh of relief. The hard part of his job was done, and only with a few scratches. However, his stomach dropped looking at the grumpy feline, remembering he was still far from done."

 manul.5.t: "Deceptive Denizens"
 manul.5.desc: "Heinu gazed over his shoulder back at Lake Baikal. Siberia did not quite match his home of South Africa, but that did not mean it lacked its own beauties. As he returned to his hike, he could not believe how fortunate he was to have this opportunity.\n\nWhen some men in his company had suggested the idea of camping he had seen it as a break from the constant warring in West Alaska, however, he had since redeveloped an appreciation for campaigning. It was a rare moment of peace in Heinu's life.\n\nThe mercenary stopped upon seeing a rare instance of fauna on his trail. Before him was a round gray shaggy cat with emerald eyes. Mistaking it for a stray, Heinu decided to approach in an attempt to pet it. Unfortunately for him, the creature was not having any of it.\n\nReaching down to pet, the manul slowly shifted back before pouncing on his head. In a state of shock, the mercenary remained motionless as the feline began scratching at his face. He was stirred to action however when he felt the manul's large fangs sink into his ear. Now energized, he tried swiping at the manul to no avail, as it turned itself around before sinking its fangs into his right eye.\n\nEventually, the manul got bored with its attack and left with a trophy in its mouth. The Mercenary found himself covered in blood, and half his vision gone. It was clear he would need medical attention, but more than anything he would need an excuse when he got back to camp. After all, he could not rightfully go back and tell his buddies that he lost to an overweight house cat.\n\nAs he stumbled back, he came up with the perfect story, if a little cliche. He had fought a bear, and won, but lost his eye in the process. As he neared the camp he took a deep breath, running through his concocted series of events."
 manul.5.a: "Sure enough, they bought it."
 manul.6.t: "Imitations"
 manul.6.desc: "Leaning on the side of a truck, the sweet taste of nicotine graced the back of Karol's throat as he watched the scattered men before him inspect the abandoned farm. Officer Karol had sent his men on a 'training' mission to teach them about reconnaissance. All they had to do was find a cat and report back to him, simple as that. Yet, he watched in unfortunate expectation as the rookies fumbled their way across the farm.\n\nOf course, this action was not technically sanctioned by the government, not that anyone was going to stop an officer of his rank. No, truthfully he just wanted a pet cat, similar to that of the Vozhd. Mura had created a craze in the state, and Karol was not about to be left out.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the approach of one of his rookies, with arms full of some sort of fluff. Upon closer inspection though, officer Karol smiled upon realizing his subordinate's success. \"Karol, sir! I found these strange kittens in the loft of the barn. Are these satisfactory?\"\n\nKarol picked up one that looked particularly adorable and began inspecting it. The confused kitten had thick gray fur with black spots. Its shaggy coat made way for large ears and the most precious little face imaginable. She was perfect!\n\nCalmly, Karol replied to his subordinate. \"This will do. Put the rest back where you found them and gather up the rest of the men. I want to visit the village hunter and get some information on this creature.\" The rookie saluted and hurried off. Left alone, officer Karol made his way inside the truck for some privacy. He petted his new companion, as he looked into her green eyes, thinking of a name."

 IRK_weakened_securocracy_desc: "The Union lives on with us, the last remnant of continuity of governance. Our institutions are strong, weathering the Second World War, the coup that split our Union, the long retreat, and the Siberian War. But we delude ourselves if we think that securocratic officials such as the NKVD did not play a part in their decline. With the recent change in governance, we do not deem it opportune to permit such overcorrections as the NKVD is specialised in to continue; accordingly, the bluecaps shall be reined in somewhat."
 IRK_supreme_securocracy_desc: "The NKVD is the shield and sword of the Revolution. With our trained NKVD officers and unmatched security apparatus, we are to be finally safe from threats internal and external - free to put down the traitors and reclaim the proletarian state. In order to protect the revolutionary state, we will ensure its supremacy over all other governmental organs save for the head of state himself."
 IRK_the_kgb_desc: "As we began to expand our borders, the need for a proper intelligence bureau became evident. Seeking to undermine the corrupt and self-serving NKVD, the party faction pushed for the creation of a new, separate agency. The KGB will now serve as a sword and shield for the Presidium, shielding us from danger and striking down our enemies before they get the chance to."
 IRK_empowered_red_army_desc: "The NKVD has held a prominent role in military affairs for too long and the Presidium has taken steps to reverse course.

 IRK_administrative_shortcomings_2_desc: "Our near-collapse in the Buryatian Mutiny, combined with the recent overturning of our administration, is proof that something must be done about our administrative issues. Every day, there are reports of corruption within regional administrations, of asinine decisionmaking, and of funds being lost (or worse). There is no time to waste - something must be done, and quickly."
 IRK_remember_the_revolution_desc: "Sablin has attempted to claim the mantle of Lenin's revolution, painting himself as a true Leninist and his band of scum as spiritual successors to the October Revolution. While this is obviously nonsense, many of our citizens have fallen under the sway of these lies. We must prove that we carry the torch of the workers' revolution, while the partisans are nothing more than deceitful reactionaries. For this purpose, a propaganda campaigna appropriating his messaging will do the trick."

It demonstrated the willingness of the revolutionaries to not merely punish tyranny - but actively purge it.
