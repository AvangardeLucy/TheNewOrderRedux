 comprehensive_strategic_analysis:0 "Comprehensive Strategic Analysis"
 comprehensive_strategic_analysis_desc:0 "We need to train our staff officers to be able to grasp the strategic implication of every on-ground decision, and to be able to see the big picture as well as the small.

 production_unit_gain_4:0 "工業経営 IV"
 production_unit_gain_4_desc:0 "The introduction of the system of 'quality circles', whereby workers are now involved in the management process by being allowed to make suggestions to improve production efficiency, has started yet another revolution in the management of industries globally. In some cases, designated 'leaders' have been given the right to halt production entirely if they notice a flaw occurring - while this has tremendously increased build and output quality, it has concentrated a huge amount of power in the hands of the workers, something the field appears to be concerned about."
 production_unit_gain_5:0 "工業経営 V"
 production_unit_gain_5_desc:0 "Techniques for improving productivity not only involve workers and their specific roles but also layout and spatial organization. New methods of planning now incorporate specific factory designs with segmented and interlinked regions to minimize wasteful space and keep the flow of production running with as few obstacles as possible - requiring changes in layout, job assignment, and renovation handled in as smooth and well-planned a fashion as possible."

Techniques for breaking the power of unions entirely using competing incentives like stock options, and even shifting entire enterprises to different countries with less heavy labor law have become predominant in some parts. Others incorporate them entirely into the process using their ideological alignment. Some mix and match - but the end result is a completely changed industrial landscape of equal parts man and robotic machine."
 production_unit_gain_9:0 "工業経営 IX"
 production_unit_gain_9_desc:0 "The field of industrial management is unrecognizable from its inception several decades ago. Highly advanced practices utilizing a mixture of robots, advanced computers, and men have resulted in industrial behemoths capable of producing several times the output of what would have taken decades to complete just a few years ago. In order to keep this titanic productive capacity functional and in control modern industrial managers and techniques are more in demand than ever, and those that employ them have an immense and unbeatable competitive advantage."

 consumer_goods_reduction_4:0 "消費財生産効率 IV"
 consumer_goods_reduction_4_desc:0 "Even more prevalent these days is the rise in technology and machinery in the day-to-day lives of our citizens and the items they obtain, which have proven to be effective for them but will take a toll on our factories to produce. Therefore, refining production will help better prepare for the mass-production of these personal devices."
 consumer_goods_reduction_5:0 "消費財生産効率 V"
 consumer_goods_reduction_5_desc:0 "Consumer goods include the belongings, technology, utilities, and tools used by our countrymen on a daily basis. With technological advancements becoming even more pronounced, they allow people to greatly improve the efficiency of their everyday tasks.

 consumer_goods_reduction_6:0 "消費財生産効率 VI"
 consumer_goods_reduction_6_desc:0 "As our industry burgeons and both the world, and our country's innovators and engineers make headway into streamlining production and design, the rate at which we produce our consumer goods increase, and the negative impact it has on the rest of our economy is beginning to lessen gradually. The production of consumer goods is a vital part of the economy, and as we produce and our people buy, the flow of money into our economy will benefit us greatly."
 consumer_goods_reduction_7:0 "消費財生産効率 VII"
 consumer_goods_reduction_7_desc:0 "With the popularization of computers as more than just big, clunky devices used to crack ciphers or count censuses, the production efficiency of our economy has increased up to an even greater point. The competition between making consumer goods and the rest of our economy seems to be lessening, as new methods to increase our productivity make both our lives, and our citizens' lives easier."
 consumer_goods_reduction_8:0 "消費財生産効率 VIII"
 consumer_goods_reduction_8_desc:0 "Upstart new entrepreneurs make computers that the average person can put into their home, and production methods, supervision, and coordination have all advanced with the passing of time. As the economy develops, consumer goods fly off the shelves, injecting money into our economy and benefiting everyone that takes a part in it. The part of our economy that produces consumer goods is no longer such a ball and chain like it was in the years past."
 consumer_goods_reduction_9:0 "消費財生産効率 IX"
 consumer_goods_reduction_9_desc:0 "The economy soars. Worldwide, the efficiency of consumer goods is no longer a detriment any longer, owing to the culmination of decades of technological development: be it computers, tools, or factory organization. Both civilian and military sectors of our economy work in almost tandem, the burden of producing consumer goods having been eased as much as possible. With the prevalence of ever advancing computers, we expect this trend will only continue into the future."

Modern processes for Coal and Oil production and processing generate several times the output of previous techniques, important both for industrializing nations struggling to escape their agrarian past and developed nations attempting to carve out their mark on the world. Output, more than efficiency, is the keyword of today - he who controls the power controls the world."
 energy_technology_2:0 "改良エネルギー生産技術"
 energy_technology_2_desc:0 "A virtual arms race has begun in the field of energy production, now more heavily in the field of oil processing than any other fuel. The petroleum industry has become both immensely profitable and extremely vital for materials science with the emergence of plastics, and has pioneered techniques that not only include extremely high-volume shipping of immense quantities of oil across the seas, but large-scale processing and destructive refinement that has steadily increased in power output to match the endless hunger of both civilian and military demands."
 energy_technology_3:0 "発展エネルギー生産技術"
 energy_technology_3_desc:0 "It all came crashing down with the global oil crisis. With dramatic shocks to oil supply, the energy industry adapted as rapidly as it could towards maximum efficiency and alternative sources of energy, seeking to extract as much fuel as they possibly could from what supplies exist within their operational borders, as well as utilizing previously underused sectors. Natural gas, once burned off in gigantic flares at pump sites, has emerged as a modern champion - and techniques such as fracking, involving the internal shattering of deep bedrock formations with a fluid, have allowed previously untappable reserves to be accessed. The environmental cost of these new methods, however, is now a hotly contested debate."
 energy_technology_4:0 "現代的エネルギー生産技術"
 energy_technology_4_desc:0 "Computers and digitization have begun to emerge in this field as in many others to optimize and maximize the production cycle in previously unimaginable ways, and a new order has emerged from the ashes of the Oil Crisis. While the black gold remains the lifeblood of empires, Biofuels and increased use of non-combustion based sources have begun to radically reshape the way nations and consumers partake in the energy cycle. Increased popular demand for environmental protections has also emerged as a growingly severe side-effect of the more ruthless techniques of extraction now in common use. Global fuel consumption has skyrocketed nations previously dominated by other powers come into their own and carve out their own industries and demands. The future is anyone's game, now more than ever."
 nuclear_technology_1:0 "核エネルギー技術"
 nuclear_technology_1_desc:0 "The most titanic conflicts ever witnessed in history came to an end in the previous decade with humanity finally reaching the atomic frontier and harnessing the power of the fundamental constituents of reality - and then proceeding to use this immense energy in acts of immense and unprecedented destruction. Out of this burning, lethally radioactive fallout emerged the New Order - and the Atomic Age. Now, peaceful applications of that wartime research are rapidly emerging, as the potential for limitless energy and a post-scarcity world have begun to capture the imagination of millions of people."
 nuclear_technology_2:0 "改良核エネルギー技術"
 nuclear_technology_2_desc:0 "Improvements in nuclear power have advanced steadily as prototypes of 'nuclear submarines' and other atomic-powered vehicles begin reaching the experimental production stage. Fusion, once dismissed as the sole domain of the stars, is now the ultimate goal of nuclear engineers, with reactors the size of megaprojects being proposed in an attempt to harness this seemingly inexhaustible source. The materials science required, however, still seems to be tantalizingly out of the grasp of current science."
 nuclear_technology_3:0 "発展核エネルギー技術"
 nuclear_technology_3_desc:0 "The Oil Crisis has provoked massive funding from both governments and private sources into the avenue of nuclear power, with fission reactors assuming increasingly important roles across the power grids of advanced nations. Though energy output has increased exponentially with the development of the technology, so has the waste produced - and nuclear waste remains a hazard for dozens of generations after it is created. Solutions to efficient waste disposal and maximising the output of energy with as little nuclear fuel as possible has become the driving force behind the current industry, with other concerns thrown to the wayside."
 nuclear_technology_4:0 "現代的核エネルギー技術"
 nuclear_technology_4_desc:0 "As the crisis in fossil fuel supply eased, nuclear power has assumed less of a last-ditch role and become increasingly integrated and accepted as a standard component of the fuel grid. With fusion power remaining out of reach despite immense efforts to create a practical, net-gain reactor design, fission power has become by far the dominant field of both construction and research. Though occasional voices point to the potential safety dangers and apparent flaws in reactor design, nuclear energy as a percentage of output only seems to be increasing - and this trend is unlikely to change without some sort of radical reassessment of the technology."
