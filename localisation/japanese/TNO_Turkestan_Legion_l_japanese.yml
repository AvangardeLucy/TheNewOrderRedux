 UTL_Veli_Rides_Again_desc: "Veli Kayum was a man of decadence. He was a man who lived life best as he could with all the advantages which corruption would provide, from the free flow of cash to the countless favors which he would be owed. Now, however, he has seen the light of life. He has seen the error of corruption and free luxury. He knows that there are few things better than earning success, not asking and receiving freedoms as though there is no opposition in his way.\n\nLife has granted Kayum a chance to peer into what a life has in store for those who fight, and he is satisfied beyond measure as to what it can offer him. All that remains is to fulfill his duties to the Legion. To fulfill his duties to Turkmenistan."

 UTL_Black_Dogs_desc: "The Legion has become a pack of dogs. Betrayed, backstabbed, and left to rot by others, the Turkestan Legion finds itself being kicked to the curb by all those who interacted with it, and finally being left with its blood bubbling from its mouth.\n\nNow, foreign powers reach out to it, asking for its aid, asking for it to fight on behalf of the whims of others. What answer is there to give if not \"no\"? Now, the Legion finds itself in a position which some would consider being of geopolitical importance, an entrance into Central Asia. The Legion does not care. Now, they bite and snap at those who would hope to strongarm them into their influence. The Legion has taken it upon itself to reject all foreign influence from this moment onwards. After all, the Legion does not fight the battles of others."
 POLITICS_SHER_MUHAMMAD_DESC: "厳つい顔で、暗いサングラスをかけ、シェール・ムハンマド＝ベク・ガーザは堂々とした人間のように見える。傭兵がトルキスタン軍団を手中に収めるとは、誰が予想しただろうか。だが、ロシアの監獄からただの男の子として現れた彼は、自分への過小評価を全て覆した。\n\nソビエト連邦に対するゲリラ戦に参加する前、ムハンマド＝ベクはフェルガナ蜂起において重要な役割を果たした。彼はアフガニスタンとソビエトの国境地域に広範なネットワークを形成して情報をトルコ、日本、ドイツに売った。このネットワークはのちに、ドイツがブハラのアミールをその椅子へと再び座らせるのを助けるために使用した。\n\nナチスドイツの勝利と共にムハンマド＝ベクは傭兵としての生き方を受容し、「コルシルマート」を名乗った。これは彼の望んだ利益ではなかった……だが、力は手に入れた。彼はこの欲望に従ってトルキスタン軍団へと参加し、そしてチャンスが生まれると彼はそれを掴み、権力を手に入れた。\n\nこれが運であったか、外国の干渉であったか、それとも上層へと上り詰めるための計略だったのかは誰にもわからないが、重要なことではない。軍団が彼の手中にあり、彼の前に隔たる障害も少なく、目の前には中央アジアの雌雄を決する最終戦争が待ち受けている。"
 POLITICS_BAYMIRZA_HAYIT_DESC: "The greatest Turkic fighting force in the history of the modern world was assembled and unleashed upon her enemies twenty years ago. And for twenty years, the blood and lives of its brave soldiers has been wasted by its incompetent leadership.\n\nBaymirza Hayit was born in Yargorgan, a small village in what is now Uzbekistan in 1917. From a young age, Baymirza had shown a great deal of interest in literature and matters of the mind, only interrupted by the onset of war and his conscription into the Red Army in 1939, right after he had graduated from Tashkent University. For two years, Baymirza Hayit served the Soviet Union in fighting the Germans, until he was captured by those same Germans in 1941. It would not be the Red Army that would come to define the rest of his life, however, but the Legion formed out of Turkic prisoners of war in Germany. The Turkestan Legion.\n\nThough the Second World War had ended, the task ahead for the Turkestan Legion did not. Under Veli Kayum's leadership, they re-entered their homeland, but a mixture of sheer incompetence and greed has led to the Legion only controlling a mere fraction of the nation. The Legion's destiny remains unfulfilled, in spite of all that they have collectively sacrificed. Veli Kayum made much noise about his new plans, the \"Yangi Ergenekon\" that he had hoped to build, and like every other half-brained scheme he had cooked, it exploded in his face. Now it falls to Baymirza to pick up the pieces and begin the process of fulfilling the grand and glorious Turkic Destiny, the project of unification now in the hands of someone passionate, decisive, and most of all, competent. The path forward is clear, and all that's required now is the strength to see it through to its end."

 POLITICS_VELI_KAYUM_KHAN_DESC: "Veli Kayum-Khan began flirting with anti-communist and nationalist ideology with the rise of the Soviet Union, which he despised. He would move to Germany to study, but he chose to never return to the USSR. Soon, he rose to prominence in the Turkestani émigré movement for his pan-Turkic and anti-Soviet rhetoric and beliefs. When war broke out in Europe, he would attempt to help the Nazis with his ideology which had much in common. To achieve this, he would help found the Turkestan Legion, a unit of the army composed of Turkestani collaborators and prisoners of war. Even though they were considered \"inferior races\" by the Nazis, this attitude would quickly change as they wished to exploit the anti-Soviet sentiment of the Turkic peoples of Central Asia during Operation Barbarossa. The Legion would play a minor role in the swift conquest of Bukharin's Soviet Union.\n\nWith the end of the war, the country that had oppressed Kayum-Khan's ethnic group for so long completely collapsed, and Uzbekistan finally had a chance to become free. This push for independence would fail and wither into nothing, however, and it would be years until he would find himself with another chance. With time, tenacity, and Afghan support, however, the legion has made considerable gains. Believing in Pan-Turanism, Kayum's ultimate goal is to unite all peoples of Central Asia. Of course, the first step to do that is to defeat all those who stand in his way, no matter which meddling powers stand in his way.\n\nEven though he rules with an iron fist, Kayum still faces strong opposition. Many are not loyal to his fascist government, with some even harbouring Fayzullah sympathies. If he is to develop power as leader of Turkestan, Khan will need to secure his unstable state, and ensure that all of Central Asia stands behind him through respect, and faith in his pan-Turkic beliefs."
