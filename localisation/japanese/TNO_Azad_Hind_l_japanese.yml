 AZH_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Azad Hind is a nation born of unfortunate circumstances. Originally founded with the purpose of liberating India with the help of Japan, things quickly turned sour as Britain fell and could no longer exert its grip over the subcontinent. Rather than joining us as their one government, the people of India formed their own nation. Now, Indians were fighting their own brethren rather than the oppressors, and the war went from a hopeful revolution to a cruel conflict where brother took up arms against brother. Eventually a ceasefire was reached, and the two Indias retreated to establish themselves as nations. Bose, however, has not forgotten his dream of a free and united India, and, as darkness looms, he may soon get his chance."

 POLITICS_BOSE_DESC:0 "社会的な運命は、スバス・チャンドラ・ボースがイギリスの忠実な使用人の家に生まれ、イギリスが亜大陸を支配するために必要な無数の「先住民」の一人として働くことを意味しているように思えた。しかし、インドの一流文官として成功する寸前で、より大きな目標に奉仕するためにすべてを投げ出した－－彼の母国であり、多くの苦悩を抱えるインドという国に。\n\n会議でより早く、より過激な行動を求める、若く、ダイナミックで、左翼的な声の一人として、ボースはカルカッタの政府にも議会の最高機関にも選ばれた。それにもかかわらず、ボースはすぐに党の遅々として進まない、法律主義的な指導部と対立するようになった。戦争が勃発すると、英国のインド支配を混乱させる可能性があるとして、イギリスは彼を自宅に軟禁した－しかし、彼は映画のワンシーンのような逃亡を行い、身を隠し、変装してアフガニスタンにたどり着き、ドイツの援助を受けてソビエト連邦にたどり着いたのだ。ヨーロッパ諸国の援助が得られない中、最終的には日本に助けを求め、インド人捕虜の軍隊を組織し、デリーへの進軍を宣言したのである。それとほぼ同時に、英国のインド支配そのものが崩壊した。\n\n統一政府樹立の要請を受け、ボースは快く承諾した－－しかし、アフガニスタンとの戦争の失敗の責任を取らされ、再び投獄されそうになった。しかし、ベンガルや東部は議会ではなく、前進同盟に忠誠を誓うようになり、彼は再び逃亡した。彼は今、平和のためであれ、戦争のためであれ、もう一度デリーに進軍することを決意して待っている。全インドの運命を決める時間が間もなくやってくる－－そして、それを導くのは彼だ。"
 POLITICS_MOHAN_SINGH_DESC:0 "Mohan Singh was born in humble circumstances. A Sikh whose father died before he was even born, he struggled but succeeded in earning a place in the army and worked his way through the ranks of the military of an empire he despised. One of the very first to abandon the Raj and join the Japanese, he believed that Tokyo was the glowing light of anti-imperialism in Asia. He was second only to the Netaji himself in his absolute dedication to Indian liberation, and first in loyalty to the Empire of the Rising Sun. Even as his benefactors were forced to sign a ceasefire and leave India divided, his faith in Japan remained strong.\n\nSingh is a traditionalist, and to him the status quo is the only path forwards. He will hold the course set by Bose, even if Bose himself desires a new way. However, Singh has grown tired of this isolation in Bengal. Each day, his dream of a free and united India seems further away. The Bengali nationalists within his own country threaten to undo the pan-Indian dream that the Azad Hind government was built upon, and he will not tolerate it. He will no longer sit idle, letting the country rot like his once-beloved Netaji did. Singh, uniting party and army, will put down those who threaten his nation, his dream. When he is done, India will be united and powerful, and any who challenge it will face the consequences."
 POLITICS_LAKSHMI_SAHGAL_DESC:0 "Lakshmi Sahgal first became famous across India during the Second War of Independence. Joining the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, Sahgal quickly rose through the ranks, becoming their commander. As the war continued, Sahgal commanded her unit with pride. After the war ended, many assumed that Sahgal's career would end. However, it was only beginning.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Sahgal and her husband, Prem, saw the Azad Hind's economic slump as detrimental to their military careers, and pursued the best alternative: to fight as mercenaries. Over time, many generals in the Azad Hind, also running short on pay, followed Sahgal's example. By the time the economy recovered, Free India found the majority of its military as mercenaries. Providing an opportunity to cut corners and save money on the budget, Bose was more than happy to accept these private military contractors.\n\nAs the 1960s opened with a diagnosis of Bose's tumour, Sahgal found an opportunity in politics as the Netaji deposed his former vice, General Singh. Commander Sahgal, a household name and already a high-ranking minister, was appointed as Bose's deputy after little wait. With such a prestigious position, Sahgal saw that the time was right to get into politics. Espousing a rather jingoistic form of democratic socialism, she quickly began to appeal to both the moderate crowds of the country and pro-military sects of society.\n\nBut now, Sahgal is in control. Denouncing the Sphere, the Pakt, and the OFN all the same, and promoting the belief of India as a superpower, she has earned support from the more nationalist groups. And, willing to negotiate with Rahman, she has earned the trust of the minorities, too. But, with Singh and the INA scheming, can she succeed in her reforms?"
 POLITICS_MAHENDRA_PRATAP_DESC:0 "Mahendra Pratap, born into a princely family, was not expected to become the man he did. He would travel, going as far as South Africa to work alongside the Mahatma, in the hopes of raising awareness of British brutality in India. In 1914, a chance to gather genuine outside support for Indian independence presented itself in the form of a war so great and terrible that it would be termed the war to end all wars - the First World War. Pratap then traveled to meet with the Kaiser himself (along with a certain Vladimir Lenin), who awarded him with a medal. Having then traveled to Kabul, Pratap established the provisional government-in-exile of a free India with himself as President.\n\nDespite early successes and both domestic and international support, the government fell in 1919, after the British demanded that the Afghan Emir force them out of the country. But Pratap was not yet done. He had by this time acquired a bounty on his head, due to the serious threat he posed to the British, causing him to flee to Japan. He would work closely with Subhas Chandra Bose during his time in Tokyo, seeing his Azad Hind as the natural successor to his own government established in 1915. It was only after the War of Independence ended in 1953, however, that Pratap could return home. He had been gone for 33 years.\n\nHis expertise and impressive record as a freedom fighter naturally put him in good stead in the Azad Hind and he quickly found himself at the side of Bose. To many, the now aged ex-prince is his natural successor. Indeed, even the Japanese would be content with him take over. Pratap's time in Japan introduced him to the ideas of Pan-Asianism, something of which he now firmly adheres to. It is this blend of external and internal support, along with his populist views that earned him popularity, and now, his victory. A man of the people, Pratap can hope for their support as he begins his rule as Netaji. Sadly for him, nothing can be so certain - least of all in the Azad Hind."
 POLITICS_CHANDI_PRASAD_BHATT_DESC:0 "Born in a Uttarakhandi village, Chandi Prasad Bhatt quickly picked up on the problems of mountainous rural communities, the lack of farmland and work. Like with many Gandhians, Bhatt would defect to the Azad Hind, where he would again settle along the Himalayas. Years would pass as Free India developed its lands for the coming battle with the Republic. Many forests would be cut down, roads would be built over once fertile fields and even some ancient villages would be demolished for the sake of the war effort. Bhatt, growing more and more concerned with the destruction of nature and rural life, decided to take matters into his own hands. He would form cooperatives to help local workers compete with skilled workers from the cities, in order to gain valuable work contracts. Later efforts to save nature itself would involve collective purchases of the trees that were so desperately needed for firewood and building materials. Bhatt showed great determination all throughout his many campaigns against urbanisation, but never would be resort to violence.\n\nWhen free and fair elections finally came to the Azad Hind, Bhatt formed the Free Indian Green Party, dedicated to protecting both rural communities but also nature itself. Most radically of all, was the parties pacifist approach to politics. It therefore came as a surprise to many observers when such a young man became leader of the Azad Hind. It also shocked them when they heard his main policies, centred around ecology and pacifism. Yet Chandi Prasad Bhatt is indeed the new Netaji, and certainly one with many new ideas for India."
 POLITICS_PV_NARASIMHA_RAO_DESC:0 "Pamulaparthi Venkata Narasimha Rao was not born into a high caste, nor class. He was not born into a family of freedom fighters and politicians. Rather, he was the son of a poor, Telugu-speaking family in a Hyderabad village. However, Rao overcame his poverty, and completed not just his primary education, but went on to earn a Bachelor's Degree in the Arts at Osmania University. From there, he joined the Indian independence movement, participating in the Swadeshi movement and joining the Indian National Congress. However, this was all interrupted when the Second War of Independence went from the Indians against the colonialists to the Indians against each other.\n\nIn the chaos of war, Rao was torn between whether to support the popular, yet Japanese-backed Azad Hind Government, or the independent, but supposedly pro-British Republic of India. Eventually, after much deliberation, he reluctantly joined hands with the Azad Hind, joining the All-India Forward Bloc to cement his place in the system. After the war, Rao slowly made his way up the ladder, becoming Chairman of the exiled congress of the Madras Province. When the Sahgals entered the scene, he offered to serve as Interior Minister, and his offer was happily accepted.\n\nRao later threw his own hat into the ring, and has emerged as the next Netaji and President of the Azad Hind Government. Promising economic liberalization and a repeal of the State Atheism Laws, the people proved their wisdom and let him in. However, not all echelons of the government or the military are too happy to accept him, and he will have to tread very wisely, lest the people that put him in power turn against him..."
 POLITICS_BAL_THACKERAY_DESC:0 "Born in 1926 to an upper-class Marathi family, Bal Keshav Thackeray always had big dreams since he was a young boy. Dreams of grandeur, leadership, and a state of Hindus and Hindus alone. Those dreams, however, were uprooted during the Second Indian War of Independence where food shortages and restrictions by the provisional government forced the young Thackeray to make the arduous trek across India, abandoning Maharashtra and the land of Shivaji. Despite these radical shifts, Thackeray never abandoned the hallmarks of his ideology - Hindutva, Akhand Bharat and the pure, unadulterated rejection of anything foreign. Most exceptionally, Thackeray views Islam in extreme contempt - a corrupting, foreign stream of thought which has perversed Bharat through its invasions and conquests.\n\nThackeray initially found his allies within the small community of Marathi émigrés, many of which who shared his ideals. Around this time, the Shiv Fauj was formed - a paramilitary loyal entirely to Thackeray and his close loyalists. But by the 1950s, he came to the realization that in a land as foreign as the Azad Hind, his Marathi chauvinism would alienate him from the vast majority of the population. The Shiv Fauj then moved away from such supremacy, to a broader Hindutva-based ideology, eventually netting them a tense but necessary alliance with the Sangh Parivar - built by the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh out of a hatred of the other major political factions within the nation. Being the eminence grise within the Parivar, no faction expected Thackeray to even challenge the status quo in the organization, and much less to take power. But, against all odds, he has done exactly that.\n\nNow, Bal Thackeray stands supreme in Kolkata, his Shiv Fauj devoted and loyal, and little is stopping him from embarking on a righteous, holy crusade to reunite the great empire that India that once was. In the process, the Shiv Fauj will strive towards Swachh Bharat - one holy, pure India, free from the corrupting influences of the West. As the armies of Shiva march forwards for a new dawn, the world is petrified - awaiting Bal Thackeray's next move."
 POLITICS_JB_KRIPALANI_DESC:0 "Jivatram Bhagwandas Kripalani has seen much in his great, long life. For five decades, he has been deeply involved with Indian politics, from colonial rule to independence and the years after. In his early years, Kripalani joined up with the growing independence movement following the return of the Mahatma from South Africa. During the early 1920s, Kriplani worked as a lecturer of history and English while serving as part of the non-cooperation movement. He would become a close adherent of the Mahatma, and was given the task of spreading his teachings to other parts of India. Later on, he would be on several occasions arrested for more direct actions against colonial rule, including organising protests and for distributing anti-British material. Kripalani would be invloved in the top affairs of Congress througout the late 1920s and into the next decade. By this point, Kripalani had also turned to be a firm adherent of Gandhian ideals, particularly those relating to socialism.\n\nWhile independence did finally come to India, the nation was quickly split in two by war between the Nehru's Republic and Bose's Free India.\n\nKriplani, saw the way to victory in the elections through cooperation with other prominent socialists, which would indeed prove to be successful in the elections. Kripalani is now leader of the Republic of India, committed to the principles of Gandhian Socialism, light agrarianism and resistance against Japan. Yet there is much work for him to do to secure his position - winning an election means when there is always someone to take your place by any means necessary."

 AZH_Persistent_Communal_Violence_desc:0 "Even before the Muslim Revolt, the Azad Hind has fanatically pursued a policy of persecution against certain religions, especially Christianity and Islam, in order to purge supposed pro-Western and terrorist elements from India. This policy has manifested itself in multiple examples of government-sanctioned violence and persecution of Indian Christians and Muslims, who are often taken away from their homes and sent to concentration camps, forced to work in the government's heavy industry until they die. However, while many both at home and abroad know of the persecution of Muslims, the persecution of Christians is far more secretive, with most Naga and Mizo Christians being sent to secluded valley camps, where they work for the extraction of iron and coal. Living conditions are poor, and deaths from malnutrition, disease, and general lack of proper working conditions are all too common."

While other parts of the world (and, closer to Calcutta, the INA) have criticised our large amount of PMCs as \"a violation of the Geneva Conventions\" and \"illegal\", we have evidence to prove that these matters are perfectly legal.

Established at the request of military maverick Mohan Singh in 1955, it quickly went from a temporary military authority until stability could be reestablished to an indefinite occupation - and a hell on Earth for the Muslims. Bengalis, Assamese, Naga, and Bodo are routinely shot on sight for suspicion of terrorism or, even worse, kidnapped by security officers and sent to slave labour camps where they go with little food and work until they die. Public outcry has emerged against the MAEC both domestically and internationally, with calls for an end to the military occupation and arrest of Singh, not to mention the likelihood of another revolt if we maintain the MAEC. We must find a solution to benefit both sides, and quickly!"
