 speer_rm.1.t: "Disarming the traitors" #demob start
 speer_rm.1.desc: "Reichsührer Albert Speer was sitting in a brown leather armchair, with a grandiose and lavishly decorated wooden desk in front of him. On his right, a faintly illuminating lamp, its light dimmed by a thick beige lampshade. In his hand, a glimmering glass of amber-colored cognac, emitting a soothing, sweet fragrance. Few in this world had the privilege to live such a lavish life, surrounded by luxury and splendor. Even fewer held power comparable to that possessed by Speer, being able to command armies, construct cities and destroy or create countries at will. Yet the Reichsführer's mind was yet again plagued by worries, and a veil of uncertainty enveloped his plans for the future of his beloved Reich.\n\nNot very long ago, Germany was engulfed in flames. As the Civil War ravaged the country, Germany descended into a state of slaughter and anarchy. And in this terrible and bloody chaos, it was him, Albert Speer, who emerged victoriously and pacified the country, through clever deals and alliances with students, liberals, leftists, and foreign powersHe had promised the people reform, order, and new opportunities. And he held his promise: he brought changes in the economy, safety to the streets, and hope into the hearts of the Reich's citizens. \n\n Yet, as always, for some individuals, nothing is good enough. In a blind and mindless struggle for their impossible utopias, some of his former liberal and leftist allies have banded up and now threaten the state more than ever before. With weapons left over from the Civil War, these traitors aim to bring back the chaos Germany just went through, and implement their crazy Judeo-Bolshevik ideals. Whether through negotiations, traps, or a direct force, they must be demobilized, lest the Reich and its people perish."

 speer_rm.2.t: "For Naught" #economic incentives
 speer_rm.2.desc: "The soldier's rough hands abruptly pulled the wooden handle, the cabinet's craftsmanship displaced as he dislodged the drawer and threw it on the ground. What he took prior to that was now gripped in his hands, the Reichsmarks the traitor was once offered, of which he has never had the opportunity to use. Thus, another trap was shut in Speer's ever-growing network of deception. \n\n One thing seemingly remains clear in face of politics, in face of ideologies: money. For all your noble goals might be worth, material wealth will always be more important – or at least that is what society is conditioned to believe. And those who know the value of prosperity, gain the real prize in return: information. \n\n The treacherous owner of the bundle of Reichsmarks was neither anyone of value in the race or ability. What he had already given certainly deems any other virtue of his virtually expired, having betrayed and sold out his comrades and given away his arms, made declarations with Speer and endorsed him for the lining of his pocket. What happened next is certainly ironic, yet something that seems deserved for all it's worth. Alas, he was unceremoniously shot outside his house, blood splaterring through the rocky pavement outside as what was left of his money has been taken to bribe another weak soul."
 speer_rm.2.a: "Pathetic"

 speer_rm.3.t: "Ideologues Along the Rhine" #raid success
 speer_rm.3.desc: "Thrice the church bells rang, and the weary townsfolk congregated for weekly mass. Such is a regular scene throughout many parts of Germany, including a village on the outskirts of Stuttgart where one Sunday, as the peasant locals devoted themselves to their faith, a less-pietistic crowd gathered in an old farmhouse. \n\n It was a meeting of the anti-fascists, some 30 leading militiamen and intellectuals, that had assembled in a dining hall adorned with revolutionary banners. The purpose of this get-together? Revolution in Germany! Each attendee had their turn to speak on the matter. \n\n “Comrades, we’ve reached the fateful hour! The fascist state apparatus is at its weakest point, and the masses are ready for action. We’ve already seen eruptions of raw revolutionary energy throughout the Reich, what is required now is a revolutionary vanguard that will lead and direct this energy. All of world-history is at stake!" \n\n A third of the room applauded with great enthusiasm, before the second speaker stood up and made his remarks. \n\n I share your enthusiasm, but I must warn you Comrade, that the class consciousness of these masses is not merely obscured, but indeed buried beneath a great crust of fascist waste. The people are angered, but they do not see the proper roots and course of their discontents. They have not understood that Socialism is objectively necessary, they are oblivious of this fact. Comrades, the masses are reactionary!” \n\n Still another third of the room cheered. Unanimity eluded the group, so a third speaker rose to the occasion. \n\n “You all reek of academic ineptitude. Spontaneity IS revolution! Distributing arms is enough, the workers will do the rest. We’ll follow their lead, not the other way around!”  \n\n It was at that moment that machine gun fire ripped through the thin walls of the house, shattering bones and splattering brains until no one remained standing inside. \n\n A Wehrmacht officer inspected the scene of his resounding success, as he spoke to his confidante: “Radio headquarters, tell them the terrorist cells have been eliminated”."

 speer_rm.4.t: "Blood and Books in Berlin" #raid epic fail
 speer_rm.4.desc: "The boots echoed throughout the street corner as it was already late afternoon and most workers, be it voluntary or involuntary had left the factory, for a sudden inspection. The inspections were becoming more and more common, as reports came in that those rebellious students were trying to coordinate with the workforce. Again, there was nothing to be found of use. The inspectors then moved, even going to regular schools to look for even the slightest bit of hints to find where Brandt and Dutschke's followers would be hosting their bases and meetings.  \n\n Some pessimistic officials claimed that their actions had been done too late, or too early. That the groups were already spread throughout the Rhine and had gained sympathy even from proud Aryan citizens. They were not heard, as the high command ordered a shutdown on the most 'left-leaning' universities, with soldiers patrolling every single corner, but what they did was not only make the radical voices within the opposition seem more reasonable but push apolitical students towards them. \n\n Soon, the Gestapo would investigate through various means, to terminate their meetings before these groups could begin to organize even further and link themselves throughout the country. Their target was Benno Ohnesorg, who was in Berlin, instead of the more targeted Rhine. The carrying out of his assassination and the movement to shut down the meeting hosted by Benno did not go out as smoothly as the police planned, however. There was not only a reaction but outcry and civilians got hurt in the clashes. \n\n The Berlin Shootings did not terminate the student's base support in the area, instead, it martyred one of their leaders and it alerted them to disperse more throughout the country, as the possibility of guerrilla warfare now became a necessity. Brandt and Dutschke mourned the loss of Benno but were quick to change that mourning to motivation. His death would not be in vain. "

 speer_rm.5.t: "By Hitler's Words" #Gun confiscation success
 speer_rm.5.desc: "Albert Speer looked satisfied on his desk, his hand holding a facsimile copy from the factories around the Rhine. For all it's worth, the judeo-bolshevik militias he manipulated ever-so-masterfully not only served as fodder to him in the embroiling civil war, but also now, where they participate further in the reconstruction of Germany-to the dream of one thousand years. \n\n The warehouses of the Reich, once keeping its riches that went looted in the chaos, now serves a new purpose-inside, piles upon piles of dated guns, from bolt-action rifles to automatic machine guns, all stacked to form a mass of brown and shining gray. And from this pile, the obedient workers of the Reich come every day, taking it all to be melted, to be remolded into everything from cans to ammunition and barbed wire. \n\n While the senile man loses his grip, he was certainly an able one in his youth, Speer admits. He remembers Hitler's words and subsequent actions, his moves to unarm the populace, his rivals, and even his allies to some extent. He smiled, seeing himself emulate the acts of his teacher and predecessor, the wheel of nazism turning once again. \n\n The camps of the Reich began to fill again, its occupants once able to defend themselves, now wallowing in their failure and gullibility, the barking of the guards and the clicking metals they point searing the pain of regret deeper. What happened to them shall happen to Germany too, freedom and its tools eternally smothered."
 speer_rm.5.a: "As the cycle begins anew."

 speer_rm.6.t: "Scattered Roses in an Armed Garden" #gun fail
 speer_rm.6.desc: "It was a day of cheers for veterans of the civil war. Even if they knew that the current government was not going to be the democracy they hoped for, many liberals and social democrats, from the organized student movements and the Reichsbanner, celebrated their victories whenever they could. Although many already considered joining the leftist factions in continuing the fight, the majority were still happy to follow the political way. On a barren camp, as they sat down on cut lumps of trees, using them as seats, the groups would commemorate and even invite some of the local citizens to listen to their rallies, that highly condemned the atrocities of Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich, Goring, Bormann and sometimes, they took risks and softly criticized Speer. \n\n In the cities, these movements were more inclined to western influences, watching secretly American movies, reading banned literature, and getting access to that culture made them prone to view the Torch of Liberty in the West as the way to organize their movements. As the new Reich had received some support from the Organization of Free Nations during the Civil War, the younger partisans and the older anti-fascists on the more moderate catch-all groups shouted praises and put the United States of America on a pedestal. Whilst the leftists were not happy with this, they accepted it, as the people's front was the only way to defeat the Nazi tyrants. \n\n All could not end well for them, considering what their armed militias meant to Albert Speer. Policemen, soldiers, and secret agents began to infiltrate, raid and suppress their movements, as they went after what protected them and what made them able to fight back: their guns. \n\n It was not the wisest decision to attempt this now. The people's front fought back, and it only furthered their struggle to gather popular support and engage in more activities to undermine the authority's presence."
 speer_rm.6.a: "They kept their guns?!"

 speer_rm.7.t: "Business as Usual" #demob success
 speer_rm.7.desc: "Wolfgang was screwed and he knew it. Sweat poured from his red hair as he attempted to escape the police.  What was once the Red Rhine has essentially become a place for dissidents like him to be shot like fish in a barrel. All of his hope and dreams, a Germany not under the slavery of the conglomerates and ruled off of the subjugation of the people and off the backs of slaves a so-called superpower was going to indeed last a 1000 years. People like Speer knew that people like Wolfgang were fucked. Dissidents, on borrowed time, and they’ll all be out of Speer’s hair.\n\n“Schmitt’s going to be pissed, as well as the rest of them,” Speer thought, readying himself to scream his Gang of Four back into their seats and into submission. As he walked the Volkshall he couldn’t help but chuckle, thinking to himself, “At least I won’t have to hear Oberlander’s mouth. Of course, after this mess that these Bolshevik degenerates made, I can absolutely respect him much, much more now. Perhaps for how conservative he is he does have a few points.”\n\nSomething out of the corner of his mind dismissed him from his thoughts as he peered out the window and toward the neon lights in the street. What almost looked like a surreal painting turned out to be a man hanging in the gallows, a spotlight on him to betray the dark of night. Some demented painting of a pale man with red, frizzled hair being hauled in the air with a rope. A message against degeneracy, one against the capitalists of the world. He imagined. \n\n“Well that’s a wonderful thing for our international image.”, Schmitt said tentatively.\n\n “You can join him if you’re like.”, Speer said emotionlessly."
 speer_rm.7.a: "He could only stare."

 speer_rm.8.t: "Out of Our Grasp" #demob failure (and so is you)
 speer_rm.8.desc: "It was a terrible day for a colonel on the outskirts of Düsseldorf, reading the reports of yet another prison escape. This time, they didn't even bother with any covert actions; they simply blew a hole straight through the damn cafeteria. How could he report such a disaster? Day after day, the escaping convicts only increased, and the manhunts only failed more spectacularly. The resistance was moving across the Rhine, in larger numbers and even bolder raids. The veil to hide this insidious unrest, having been carefully assembled by the Geheime Feldpolizei, was fading by the day. Soon, the public would become aware of these supposed freedom fighters, these... terrorists! The last nail in the coffin was the Solingen raid, ending with a bloodbath on our own side as disorganized police and soldiers stormed a compound in the center of the city, only to be met with machine guns at every street corner and guerilla fighters in alley after alley. Was this not the army that once seized control of the European continent, now being defeated by mere delinquents in the streets? \n\n Analysis and reports show that the main issue at hand was that the Reichsbanner, the Studentenbewegungen, the Antifascists, and even the Zellen, were furthering their cooperation by the day. With it, the situation was becoming painfully clear: they are stronger than we thought, perhaps even stronger than we are now, and the scope of this resistance would only increase. Our ignorance, combined with our arrogance, was finally spelling our downfall.  When we began fighting against them, trying to disarm them, they only came back stronger and more galvanized by our attempts. \n\n Even now, our Abwehrpolizei suspect that thousands of students and intellectuals are ready to use the current government's supposed weakness to protest, while hundreds of militiamen are spread across the Rhine continue to wage irregular attacks against our forces, presenting their disgusting Judeo-Bolshevik ideals to honest Aryan families. The twin-headed hydra of liberalism and bolshevism will soon return to the glorious Fatherland, and the only way to deal with it is as we dealt with them before: with the bullet and the rope."
 speer_rm.8.a: "The storm is coming..."

 speer_rm.9.t: "The Rhine Riots"
 speer_rm.9.desc: "On what was supposed to be just another normal day, Speer entered his office. Instead of the usually quiet and the occasional remark by his secretary, he was instead confronted by two men and a towering stack of paper on his desk. Noticing the oppressive atmosphere, Speer spoke out: "Schmidt, Oberländer, is there a reason as to why you entered my office so early in the morning?" Oberländer, seeming more anxious and fidgety, replied first: "Mein Führer, the treacherous Untermenschen have started a riot in the Ruhr!" Still unable to grasp the situation, Speer issued a concise command: "Schmidt, tell me what's going on." \n\n Although more calm than Oberländer, Schmidt was also grasped by traces of uncertainty and replied: "It seems that the demobilization of the militia we armed during the civil war has failed. Now, hundreds, if not thousands, of former slaves, students, and dissatisfied workers are out in the streets calling for a change. Due to your absence, no concrete order has been given and the protest is threatening to spill over and envelop not just the Ruhr, but other metropolitan areas as well." Unable to hide his contempt, Oberländer cried out: "Herr Speer, it is clear that we must strike down these subversive elements first. This Untermenschen have already come to enjoy your benevolence after the civil war, any more than that and our government will be viewed as nothing but a pushover." \n\n Speer looked at the now confident Oberländer and then asked Schmidt: "How would you resolve these protests?" Schmidt, now startled, weakly replied: "We ought to negotiate and-" Before he could complete his sentence, Oberländer cut in loudly, almost screaming "MAKE US LOSE ALL CREDIBILITY?" Although irritated by Oberländers attitude, he didn't reproach him, instead, he came to a decision:"
 speer_rm.9.a: "Oberländer is right. For the survival of the Reich, this flame needs to be stomped out. Fast."
 speer_rm.9.b: "We must not alienate the people who once supported us. Schmidt, prepare to negotiate."

 speer_rm.901.t: "A Meeting with Dutschke"
 speer_rm.901.desc: "The long march through the established institutions ended in a surprising victory. The students and to-be guerrilla men were ready to face the police and the Wehrmacht to crush yet another uprising in the Rhine, but instead, they were met with Helmut Schmidt. It seems that despite the roaring protest of the NSDAP and threats coming from Oberländer himself, Albert Speer decided to negotiate with the uprising, somewhat to the shock of the various student leaders and to the disappointment of the self-proclaimed 'defense forces' of the united student movement. As the tension quickly de-escalated as Speer made his national address on television regarding the situation, the Ruhr-Universität Bochum became the center of regional attention, as tens of students and soldiers surrounded the building watching nervously as what seemed to be a negotiation unfolded as Rudi Dutschke presence became known. \n\n''It is a surprise to see you here, Schmidt.'' The student leader said, sitting down at the negotiating table, carrying a small folder that had a list of the most important demands in detail. ''Well, there's only one good way to shut you kids up.'' The minister chuckled but saw no reaction from the protester. ''You must know that we are not alone in our effort. The institutions must bend and reform as Speer promised us.'' Rudi spoke loud and clear, but Helmut just shrugged it off. ''We know..'' He received the folder, reading it thoroughly. ''Some of these demands are absurd, the party is already against us listening to you and reforming at all.'' Schmidt looks at Dutschke. ''Then approve the ones you can. We both know that change must happen and will happen.'' The student leader got up and left the room, as silence filled it once he slammed the door while leaving."
 speer_rm.901.a: "An odd time for reform."

 speer_rm.10.t: "Bloody Clashes on the Rhine"
 speer_rm.10.desc: "Speer was once again looking through a variety of reports concerning the Reich, some uplifting and some leading much to be desired still. For a moment, he paused and thought back on the events that transpired here this very morning. He had put his trust in Oberländer, promising to quell the protests before they spill over. He was curious about the results of his decision and just when he was about to order his secretary to call for Oberländer and Schmidt again, he heard a knocking on the door. Now gesturing to his secretary to receive his visitors, he saw the two men that just plagued his thoughts coming in with grim expressions on their faces. \n\n Wanting to break the tension, Speer asked with a hint of uncertainty in his voice: "The protests, what happened?" This time, Schmidt stepped up first: "Violent clashes erupted all over the town, protesters and police forces have both suffered numerous casualties, with hundreds on injured. Heer Speer, we have used enough force already, we must-".  Speer, with a weary look, raised his left hand and interrupted Schmidt: "Negotiate? Let Oberländer make a case for himself first. After all, his suggestion got us here in the first place. Herr Oberländer are you aware of the precarious situation you put the Reich in?" The usually hot-tempered Oberländer lost most of his initial confidence in the face of Speer's cold but fitting remarks. However, he mustered his courage and answered: "I am well aware of the escalating nature of these protests. Yet, our hands are tied. We must not cave in. A little more force and these students shall disperse, as they always have." \n\n This time, Schmidt, who had been growing increasingly impatient, blurted out: "Please, do not apply further force. This will not only alienate the protestors, but also other elements of society, let us come to an agreement with them, at least in name!" Once again, Speer mustered the two men in front of him, knowing the weight of his decision. He spoke:"
 speer_rm.10.a: "Oberländer, this is the last time you shall have my faith. Prove. Your. Worth."
 speer_rm.10.b: "Fighting fire with fire will only burn down the Reich. Schmidt, the stage is yours."

 speer_rm.1001.t: "Making Some Concessions"
 speer_rm.1001.desc: "A deal; an mutual agreement fron two sides for a certain interest. A triumph; a great victory against a rival. \n\n Both sides sang of these words as their leaders rang out a celebration of triumph, whether in the name of the people or in the name of the aryan race. What is clear however, is the seemingly lack of reception on such a celebration in what many see as merely an underhanded defeat. \nThe sound of rifles dropped on the ground, shuffling papers, or unlocking metal doors gives little in terms of celebration. Instead, it merely brings a question of goals, of the meaning of the fight as both sides began asking, "Is this what we wanted?" \n\n The seeming moderation of their leaders on the table has strenghtened the fanatics of both sides. They accused their commanders of incompetence, of weakness as they splinter further from their source. New factions in the NDSAP arose, and urban guerilla movements split to fight their own fights, both sides seemingly united against the deal. Afterall, what will be the use of free people if their cause isn't archieved, free information if censorship still stands? The problem must be uprooted from the source, not merely trimmed at the edges."
 speer_rm.1001.a: "A path to stability."

 speer_rm.11.t: "The Slave Strikes"
 speer_rm.11.desc: "Since the start of the German state and the foundation of the Weimar republic, whatever the police were unable to contain, was a job given to the military and while the units of the Heer in the Rhine were already on high alert, now, regiments from all over Germany were pouring in, Henning von Tresckow had given a simple, standard order, surrounding all protest controlled areas and slowly, close in, while granting security to anyone who voluntarily surrenders, easy, clean and while some of Schörner clique may dislike this approach, they will still follow the orders, or that is what he thought, Then came some of the most stressful 3 hours of Tresckow's life since the world war. From of nowhere, checkpoints were requesting support, some units were declaring retreat over some areas, reporting being "outnumbered" breaking the line and opening holes for the students to escape or bring reinforcements. \n\n In an hour and thirty minutes they realize that not only the students, and the partisans but the slaves have joined the riots, it takes them another hour to secure a new perimeter with all commands on emergency and high alert, and with the tension was escalating, a new report came in. A handful of commanders were ignoring all communication while at the same time forming armor squadrons supported by infantry heading directly to the areas controlled by protesters. Another thirty minutes was what it took to identify the commanders as Schörner's close friends. with the situation escalating, a new telegram came from the heart of Germania to Tresckow's HQ."
 speer_rm.11.a: "All units are ordered to Put down the riots by any means necessary failure to follow order will be punished."
 speer_rm.11.b: "By order of the Fuhrer, all units are commanded to evacuate all population centers and wait for further orders."

 speer_rm.1101.t: "A Meeting with Brandt"
 speer_rm.1101.desc: "The meeting would be at a historical university in Frankfurt that was spared from the heavy conflict, on a long table inside the staff room on opposite sides. On the right side of the door, there was the Deputy Führer on the left, Kiesinger, and Willy Brandt, the main advocate for the end of slave labor on the right, both looking at each other, there was no bad blood or clear hate, but there was still some tension in the air. \nThe meeting started with the deputy peaking up some papers and reading "From the date when the Führer makes his declaration, The Reich will secure peace and coexistence for the German people and all there subject by the creation now laws on regulations for work both voluntary and involuntary." Brandt's face took a sour look at the word 'involuntary', but he let Kiesinger speak. "The Reich will from now on take a harsher stance on involuntary work, working harder on extracting this cancer from the Reich." Both men look at each other, with Brandt reading the rest of the paper, a painfully long list of what the Reich fears to call compromise, and what the students would not call real progress. And as shaky as this ground was, it at least prevented further deaths, and now, came the time for the agreement. \n"Now, what would you do?" Kiesinger asks, a laugh came from Willy, breaking the tense ambient that was felt over the entire talk "Well, I may go while the negotiations are still in effect, and arresting me would be political suicide, I think I will leave to another place, I have some ideas." Willy responded, "If that is your choice, I'm sure you would enjoy a new life in America publishing a book and working for the CIA." Says the deputy, with a laugh of his own. "Don't worry. I will come back, you still have much progress to make." Then, Willy grabs a cigarette from one of his pockets and offers it to the Deputy."
 speer_rm.1101.a: "A promise that shook the room."

 speer_rm.12.t: "The General Strike"
 speer_rm.12.desc: "The thudding sound of boots echoed through the streets as endless rows marched out and through the factories, the disgruntled faces of workers stayed stone hard as they waited for nothing. A general strike has begun among the workers. The colors of the revolution were already starting to become clear as the German people have left their workplaces of industry and munitions in defiance of the oppressive Nazi state.  The students chanted and sang in a youthful joy and defiant tone, even the people themselves are demanding the freedom of the slaves deemed as "subhumans " by the state. \n\n The singing got louder and the stamping got harder as state police arrived to control the protests, attempting to end the strike which would devastate the economy of the already weakened nation.  The situation got tense as defiant students were grabbed by policemen and stone-faced workers threatened. Suddenly, a loud scream pierced the air as a worker was bludgeoned over the head, followed by the rest of the workers rushing towards the police. \n\n Speer's face was streaked with a bright red, his eyes darkened and his bottom lip quivering. His advisors watched him carefully, silently, wrongful of what was to come next. Speer couldn't believe this. The proud country sculpted by Hitler himself was falling apart at Speer's weak judgment.  The truth was seeping into the Führer's empty mind. "What in the hell is this!" he shouted in outrage. His followers silently started down to the floor. "How could this have been managed so poorly, and now the proud workers of Germany are tumbling into degeneracy for these sub-human swine! I want this sorted, by whatever means necessary, send in the police..the army if you need to!" But Speer's words were empty as were his orders as everyone in the room knew that time was against the Fuhrer and the cracks in the Nazi Eagle have begun expanding."
 speer_rm.12.a: "Have the workers gone mad?"
 speer_rm.12.b: "Get me in a call with Robert Ley."

 speer_rm.1201.t: "In the Unions"
 speer_rm.1201.desc: "How bad could it get? The German Labour Front, which was the main arm of millions of proud, Aryan workers, was now tainted by the Judeo-bolshevik threat. The DAF, once the main arm of the German war machine, had broken its own bones. It could become obvious to any observer what the next step was going to be, as the Gang of Four's influence had risen as the rational voice during the strikes. The worker army was fed up with their conditions and an agreement was to be made. First, Robert Ley, former Gauleiter, Reichsleiter, and Reichsorganisationsleiter was leading the Front since 1933. Many of the reformers pointed out his leadership to be the problem, unlike the revolutionaries who claimed the whole existence of a subservient trade union to the NSDAP was the issue. at hand.  \n\n Nonetheless, the stage was set, and the representatives made their decisions clear. Robert Ley's three-decade-long rule over the DAF was ended and he was to retire, while his rhetoric of restoring absolute order to the employer was diminished within the organization. The strikers that were brave enough to represent the revolting masses met face to face with the party officers, most of them knowing full well they could be arrested right there and then, but they counted on Speer's promise to resolve it 'peacefully.' \n\n Although the new leader was still to be handpicked by Speer's cabinet, he had to meet some demands by the thousands who stopped the factories in those dire days. An agreement was finally reached, as the new Head of the German Labour Front was appointed and began cooperating with the government to improve the conditions of the workers."
 speer_rm.1201.a: "Phew. We avoided a disaster there."
 
 speer_rm.13.t: "March on Germania for Freedom"
 speer_rm.13.desc: "It was a busy day in the streets of Germania. Around the Brandenburg Gate, there were not hundreds of soldiers, but hundreds of revolting men and women. A scene not seen in years came out of the bloody suppression of the general strike. Now, not were only the slaves being put down, but paid laborers as well. Willy Brandt and Rudi Dutschke, once with some conflict, put their differences aside in a speech that shook the Reich. They announced that the German people would not accept the actions of the current government, they would demand change and face the politicians ruining the nation by appearing on their own lawn. The capital was shaken, as thousands moved in and locals joined as they grouped together with various demands, jobs, freedom, and more political change, in their eyes, Speer promised so much, yet, he delivered so little.\n\n For the government in the Volkshalle, this was the worst act of treason they had seen ever since the fall of the German Empire. The troops were quickly deployed, to protect key locations from possible looters and rioters. The discussion arose as they looked out from the windows and saw the faces of protests, as the embassies were already getting ready to quickly report this. They had to act now or their entire stability could be compromised, or for the 'Gang of Four', their international image could be tarnished further. Reports of guards being overwhelmed by protesters were arriving also from neighboring towns, but for now, this level of unarmed rebellion did not escape Germania. \n\n As everything seemed to only spiral downwards, the hardliners were quick to come out with a solution, as two mechanized and three motorized divisions were sent to Germania. A shocking order to the more reformist sector. ''Are you insane?" Tresckow shouted, getting up from his chair and slamming the table. ''This is not the solution!" Oberländer would grit his teeth and shout back. "It is the only solution!""
 speer_rm.13.a: "Send in the tanks."
 speer_rm.13.b: "THAT'S ENOUGH!"

 speer_rm.1301.t: "The Four Meet the Two"
 speer_rm.1301.desc: "After long and grueling months of nationwide riots and protests finally culminated in this contentious affair: Speer’s most venerated advisors, the most hated men in the party, were to meet the leaders of the revolt, Rudi Dutschke, and Willy Brandt. \n\n The sound of the door opening was a fright to the four men who were obviously deep into their thoughts. Brandt and Dutschke had a look of cordiality on their faces, an obvious veneer. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Schmidt.” It was almost too friendly an atmosphere for it to be comfortable, especially considering the consequences and background of this historic event. “It’s my pleasure, Brandt.” \n\n Brandt sat down and prepared his throat for a long day. “Well, gentlemen, you all know the issues we are discussing today and there is no need to go over them. The Reich has tried to suppress every single strike and protest, and now it is seeing that the people want change. However, today we are pleasantly surprised by the sudden change of heart. Seeking peace is always far better than spilling blood, in my mind.” \n\n Schmidt was screaming internally but appeared almost as calm as Tresckow, who was as silent as the grave. Things weren’t going according to his plan.“We have some demands, and they need to be met. Better worker’s rights, more workplace democracy. Abolishing slavery. You surely understand us when we say that this is the bare minimum.” Brandt appeared almost overconfident “And you need to understand this is most difficult. We can’t do this without destabilizing the whole country, neverminding that the party would be at our throats…”  Schmidt was slightly irritated by Brandt’s overconfidence but continued to speak. “And we, frankly, don’t care about your party’s issues. Surely fixing this issue now is better than delaying the inevitable?" "It truly is, Brandt. But it won't be easy." Erhard replied, almost mumbling, being barely heard by anyone."

 speer_rm.1401.desc: "Alarming news arrived from the German capital, as the countrywide protests, strikes, and a march around one of the city's greatest landmarks, the Brandenburg Gate, were silenced in a matter of hours. The Wehrmacht was fully deployed, after sectors of the army were already engaged in mass arrests and riot control, now mechanized and elite divisions were sent to stop the marches. Fleeing protesters and armed soldiers were seen all across Germania. \n\n After hundreds of gunshots were heard, the supposed ''resistance'' finally folded and those defending themselves either fled back to their cells or surrendered. Although Oberländer reported what he called 'a decisive strike against Judeo-Bolshevik terrorists', the civilian casualties caught in the crossfire and the increased property damage have further stained Speer's image internationally and among his reformist supporters."

 speer_rm.15.desc: "Benedikt was a history teacher. A political dissident he believed that he would spend the rest of his life under the rule of Nazi lunatics who have the notion that you’re able to control the corporation. He barely made it through a University that does not at all matter because of all it was: a propaganda camp to ensure that the brainwashed can brainwash generations. He always knew everything Speer said was bullshit, but that didn’t stop him from joining his forces and gunning down some SS, and boy, did he love every minute of it. What he didn’t predict was just how stupid his government would truly be. During the Bürgerkrieg the government was stupid enough to leave guns in the hands of political dissidents like him. They were stupid enough to let radios stay in the wrong hands as someone named Roter spoke on the radio every morning on Freivolk Radio, speaking about how dissidents across the Reich were causing a fuss. \n\nIt was that which gave him hope. Throughout every single revolution in history, it was not the moderates that got their way in any coalition. No, it was the radicals. The men that, like him, did not believe in liberal half measures. Who believe that nothing good throughout history occurred out of moderation. The French and Russian Revolutions are excellent examples of this. And Benedikt Huber, once a teacher of Nazi children was aiming his gun at Nazi parents for a better world. \n\nEvery morning, Freivolk like him would listen to the radio and aim their guns wherever Roter pointed them. Benedikt loved every minute of it as he toured throughout his old Reich letting truth fly out of the barrel of his gun rather than the lies he used to tell children and boy, was he truly alive now. He knew that history would know the name of what was happening: the Bund Demonstrations."

 speer_rm.16.desc: "It was a rainy day. Prison inspector Schmidt gazed out of his office window with a melancholic look and extinguished his fuming cigarette in an ashtray. Gray raindrops raced to the glass pane's bottom, and from the background, the facility's paved courtyard and empty barred windows stared back at him. It was not a large prison, like the expansive slave camps of the East or the extermination camps of the wartorn past. It was a small jail, tucked away in the mountainous hills of Brandenburg. But now, it housed, among a plethora of political prisoners and dangerous murderers, two men who were the most hated yet worshipped, most despised yet admired figures of the modern German political landscape. Two men who were the faces of salvation and a bright future for some, and the incarnation of the Judeo-Bolshevik plague for others. These politicians were Willy Brandt and Rudi Dutschke. And tomorrow, they were going to be executed. \n\n Just a dozen hours later, it dawned upon a cold and humid morning, not uncommon during the chilly autumns of Northern Germany. The guards, striding down the hallway, knocked on the iron doors of prison cells. A new day in the prison - at first glance, not dissimilar from the last one. However, there was one change that none of the convicts and few of the guards noticed - Brand and Dutschke were not there. Neither among the convicts nor locked away in their solitary cells. \n\n From dusk to dawn the two men were beaten, electrocuted, and put through any kind of pain that the guards could think of. They were tortured, before their inevitable execution, in two separate rooms - hearing only each other's screams. Now at last they stood together - shoulder-to-shoulder in the prison yard, barefoot, spitting out teeth, coughing up blood, and painting the morning dew crimson. An officer lined up five wards, while a sixth one covered Brandt's and Dutschke's eyes with a piece of cloth - a little bubble of humaneness in the ocean of blind violence - and ordered them to face the wall. Then, a shrill band of rifle fire echoed through the sylvan hills - and the two martyrs fell to the ground, disfigured by bullets and covered in blood. Thus, they were no more - and the history of Germany changed forever."

 speer_rm.17.desc: "Life is a gruesome path, dotted with loss and misery and at its end, shrouded forever in a black mist, death itself. We all tread this path in the name of some goal, to achieve something greater than ourselves and contribute to humanity's future. For our beloved comrade Wolfgang Reinhold, death came in the form of execution, ordered by the Speerite class traitors of the Luftwaffe high command. And though he is no longer among us, and his absence echoes deeply in our sorrowful minds, I am positive that he died for a noble cause, in the name of bringing forth a new age, more just, free, and equal than the one we live in. So let the legacy of comrade Reinhold's heroic deeds live on in our hearts forevermore! Glory to the workers of the world!" Gerhard Schürer sat back down into his leather armchair, panting rapidly. The whole room was clapping, and as Gerhard took a sip out of his glass, he glanced at Markus Wolf, sitting at the end of the table in his gray uniform, his hand placed on a shiny leather peaked cap. Comrade Wolf was gently smiling. \n\n Just a week ago, Gerhard and Reinhold were still together causing unrest in the lower ranks of the Luftwaffe as part of Operation Krähe, a plan engineered by Wolf himself. Its goal was to weaken the Luftwaffe through sabotage and spreading propaganda. Disaster struck a mere four days before Gerhard delivered his emotional speech at the revolutionaries' meeting. Wolfgang Reinhold was caught infiltrating confidential archives and upon closer inspection of his documents, they proved to be falsified. After hours of torture, Reinhold confessed, only to be beaten to death in his prison cell the next day. A vicious hunt began for traitors and infiltrators in the ranks of the Luftwaffe, but to no avail.  What had to be done had already been done - seeds of doubt, mistrust and mutinee planted in the Reich's airforce. Another triumph for Markus Wolf and his communist revolutionary movement."

The infiltration of civilian, economical, political, and military institutions was always a great victory for the members of the worker's revolution, but it also came at a cost the price of being discovered. \n\n And while most members of the infiltration teams are willing to do these high-risk gambles, not all of them are as capable of doing so, and now it was Armin to explain that a great cell inside of the Wehrmacht was discovered due to some loaves of bread. \n\n It was a routine of stealing supplies, documents, and other objects from factories and depots so they could be sent to the people who need them the most, most of the time, those were explained by simple bureaucratic mistakes, forcing the authorities to focus their attention in other places until the trace runs cold and they are forced to abandon the investigation, until a while ago. Some low-rank infiltrators started to steal food supply without informing, giving this supply to the population, or just eating it themselves, and they had the brilliant idea of stealing MREs. \n\n It only took a single cook reporting this, the MREs were found easily after that, is hard to explain why you have one if you are not a soldier, after that, it was just going up the contraband chain to find most of the perpetrators, those whom, spill the beans about the operation, of course, they did not know there entire extent of the infiltration, but they could name some especially sensible targets, irreparably damaging the operation and putting all other infiltration missions to an indefinite halt."

 speer_rm.19.desc: "Behind every revolution, there is a man with an idea. In the case of Germany, that man at least in the Kriegsmarine was Felix Scheffler, who had the mission of infiltrating the Kriesgmarine, to help the German Revolutionary Movement, unfortunately, that was easier said than done, since it appears the Kriegsmarine was better at finding dissidents that he expected. Admiral Dönitz had called him and Verner, Ehm, and Neukirchen to his office, Dönitz told them they were suspected of espionage and sabotage, and that if they didn't confess, the consequences were going to be bad. Felix had to think fast, he had to save Operation Eisberg, so he quickly invented a story about him being the only true spy, and Verner and Ehm were only helping him because he had threatened their family. Dönitz then called the guards to arrest Scheffler and apologized to Vener and Ehm. It appears that the operation will go on, even if Felix was out of the picture. \n\nAnd so it did, the execution of Scheffler lead to a movement inside the navy, as they began to accuse each other of communist betrayal or revolt against the leadership as Felix was a respected veteran, an original Sturmabteilung officer and the low ranks looked up to him. The Pandora's Box was open, as the Western Squadron split between revolutionaries and loyalists, a chaotic battle between once friendly ships began, the Wehrmacht reorganized itself to try and stop this disaster, and the port of Hamburg was seized by Wolf's men with inside support, a fatal blow to the Reich."

It was the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the backbone of the German Luftwaffe, that Heinrich flew into the Battle of Britain, as well as many of the battles that lead to the victory of Germany in the Second World War. He used his fighter like the rest of the Reich’s warriors on the ground used their Karabiners, following their orders to further the greatness of Germany. He watched as he bombed the Soviet forces. The men and women who fought to their dying breath for the various existence of their people. He watched as he drove the swords of National Socialism throughout Europe, what should have been liberation instead was simply the enslavement of the entire continent. Corporations turned Germans into numbers and had the power of gods. It wasn’t long until he found himself within the allegiance with Wolf. \n\n He knew that today was going to be the day that he died. He knew it by the look in Markus Wolf’s eyes: he had just sent one of his men on a suicide mission. But it was none the matter. He had made his life worthless the moment that he played a hand in the enslavement of Europe, and as he began his job in upper management for the Luftwaffe he had played a hand in the bombing of Russia for the better part of a decade. His action would never make up for the things he’s done, and the widow that he left behind. He hoped, however, that his Great-Grandfather, Otto von Bismarck, would smile upon him at the gates of Valhalla. An emergency meeting is being held, and Speer, as well as his henchmen, were about to tell him that it is now his job to bomb his own people. \n\n “It is of our utmost duty to scour across our fatherland and route out these degenerates once and for all. These aren’t people, they are pests, parasites to the true sons and daughters of Germania and we must stop them before they destroy the Fuhrer’s legacy. After this, a great purge will be conducted throughout the government because it has come to my attention that-” Heinrich interjected, “Speer?” \n\n Albert Speer had been taken back by the man who dared disrespect him, and as soon as he opened his mouth to scream at him the last thing he heard was “Go fuck yourself.”, as the Great Grandson of Otto von Bismarck unloaded lead into his skull and made his final stand within the war room."

Outside are the sounds of violence and strife, inside those of the silent whisper of plots. Wondering and hoping upon the fate of Germany, he looked back to the papers he had signed, placed in the middle of a messy desk filled with other choices–alternatives, but none to match the motley assortment that he settled upon; a last-ditch effort to save the fatherland from those that wished it harm through those that will do anything to control it. \n\n Kurt Georg Kiesinger; a fellow member of Speer's small cabal before it dissolved and a cool-headed pragmatist that he trusts enough to rely on; Theodor Oberländer, the seeming opposite of Kiesinger in his ruthlessness and fanaticism in devotion to the Germany of Hitler–a trait that can be excused given the role of protection he will fill; Hermann Josef Abs, another opposite in his sheer greed and self-serving egoism, but one that luckily aligns with the state's current interests–recovery of capital; and lastly, Hans Spiedel, hero and Saviour of the Reich, a dear friend, and a powerful military asset–now simply reduced to relying on his charisma to perform bread and circuses before the Reich's numerous allies and adversaries, assuring all is fine in the land of blood and iron. \n\n Giving a mighty sigh, the old Prussian moved his mind away from considering the people's reaction–much less those abroad as he simply hoped that by encompassing every aspect of the Reich's top political spectrum, he can lift all of the Reich along from the abyss it is helplessly falling into. As the dawn approaches, he packed the paper and prepared them for release, preferring to lay ignorant upon its reception."

This idealism was shattered during the Night of Long Knives, however, and von Tresckow began to feel a strong hatred towards the NSDAP, something that only increased during the Reich's later actions. \n\nDespite this, von Tresckow served admirably in the Second World War, leading numerous operations on the Eastern Front that some mark as vital to Bukharin's collapse and the victory of the Reich.

One of the greatest commanders in the Wehrmacht, vital to Bukharin's defeat and the German victory. Once upon a time, he would be known for his calls for reforms, his discipline, and his power within Speer's inner circle. He would also be known for his actions during the national emergency, becoming the head of state himself after the death of the second Führer. One day, the people of the Fatherland would smile upon a peaceful land, one that had itself a Kaiser once again, and would rejoice. \n\nBut that day, will probably never come. \n\nDue to the NSDAP and the Gestapo, now mainly led by Oberländer, attempts at overthrowing the commander, his plans for restoring political stability have been foiled. The leftist revolutionaries only benefit from seeing what they call 'reactionary dogs' kill each other and the hope of a brand new, reformed Reich has faded into obscurity. With Kiesinger's betrayal and with his other political associates considering leaving the country, the army has turned against itself, as paranoia spreads, the real traitors lurk, while truly loyal men are indicted.

The great contenders of the Bürgerkrieg are dead or in hiding, there is no man currently in power that can step into such shoes. And so, it shall not be one man, but several. Henning von Tresckow has moved quickly to seize power from the Reichstag to prevent another chaotic civil war. His Salvation Junta is a collection of various officers and power brokers: fellow reformist Kurt Kiesinger as his Head of State, renowned banker Hermann Josef Abs as the minister of finance, and Hans Speidel as his foreign minister. While his new junta is composed mostly of reformists, he has appointed Theodor Oberländer as the security minister as a compromise with the hard-liners, to prevent another potential civil war. Whatever else, Germany cannot afford another Führer, nor another Bürgerkrieg."

Only with the rise of tensions with other cliques did it come to throw its support behind one man, Albert Speer. In the wake of his victory in the Bürgerkrieg, much of the organized opposition to the Reformist cause was shattered. That did little to truly unify the party, even as they continued to throw their support behind the new Führer. But now, that man now lies dead, and with him, the unity of the party. The party cannot be allowed to collapse as it once did, von Tresckow will not allow it. Tonight, before the assembled men of influence in the party, he shall argue for unity. Above all else, they must proceed rationally. They cannot afford infighting at so crucial a juncture, the very fate of Germany rests in their hands now."

We shall contact Helmut Schmidt, and see if we cannot come to some form of agreement. Certainly, we do not fully embrace their beliefs, but they can lend a valuable hand in our attempts to foster unity. Further, winning the full support of a group that Speer was always hesitant to deal with will show that our junta is honest with our intentions.

We cannot afford the risk that another might claim to be Speer’s successor; while they would certainly never be able to unify all the reformists, we cannot allow such a torch-bearer to disrupt our efforts. If the junta is to stand, the Speerites cannot be allowed to. Von Tresckow shall consult with Oberländer immediately, to create a list of those truly loyal to Speer. Of these, almost all of them will need to be purged immediately, to ensure that they can never pose a threat to the new regime.

We can afford to purge the party of the Speerites, to ensure they never pose a risk to our regime.

To the people, he shall say that this is not only a great act of mercy but also a sign of goodwill. The party seeks to unify the people, and it is willing to allow some measure of dissent from them to achieve this.

Although there are many which we intend to keep in jail, perhaps for life, we will consider moving some of the lesser threats to nicer jails, in a show of muted goodwill.

Indeed, some have argued that under the cover of “renovating the political system for modern times”, von Tresckow has completely revised the very nature of the German constitution. Others have questioned in particular the replacement of “the Führer” with “the leader of Germany” and other such terms, wondering if this implies that von Tresckow might have decided to retain his control of the government, and his junta, for longer than he admits.

Writing as a German nobleman, he shall appeal to Louis Ferdinand to take the throne, offering him the crown if he will come and unify the fractured lands. It will be no small undertaking, but he is sure that his majesty is capable of it. Backroom talks have, of course, confirmed that the man is already willing to step into power if asked.

He has thought that about them and has probably slaughtered hundreds of them, but now, after he witnessed the horrors of the Nazi regime, having full access to documents that were not available to him before, he realizes that even the crazed whims of Bukharin and Lenin were better than Hitler.

With him and most of his associates in jail, we cannot risk another terror attack or politically motivated massacre by the NSDAP supporters in the army or in the cities.

Sending men to die to rescue them would not amount to any benefits, as the dire circumstances the nation faces worsen, as a battle will be certainly the result of the encounter between the garrison and the terrorists of both the anti-fascist and godless communist groups.

 tresckow.1.desc: "Oberländer was often intense, Kiesinger thought, but as he walked into the man's office, something had clearly whipped the man into a true fury. Oberländer rose to greet him immediately, with a loud “Sieg Heil!”, which Kiesinger returned in a somewhat more subdued manner. Oberländer wasted no time after this, “I’m sure you have heard the rumors circulating, and it seems with every passing day von Tresckow does not refute them! No, he explicitly emboldens the monarchists, weakening the party in our legal system.” He paused here for a breath, before barreling on, “For a time, I was captivated by his lies that it was merely a matter of reform, to make our great nation yet stronger. But it has become obvious that he wishes to destroy the Reich, and then hand off the remnants to a man who has never held an ounce of power. I ask you, can you abet this, Kiesinger? A man of your legal background and stature?” \n\nOnly here did he give Kiesinger an opportunity to speak, once he had already secured the answer he wished for. “No, I cannot. Germany needs a Führer, and if von Tresckow is unwilling, we shall have to appoint another. You wish to be this next Führer, I assume?” Oberländer nodded solemnly, but could barely repress his smile as he did so. “I will take this burden upon my shoulders, for the glory of the German Reich, that it may last a thousand years.” Kiesinger rose, “Then we have much work to do.” \n\nSoon after, the two made their way into the Germanian office of the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft, escorted by Oberländer’s bodyguards and loyalists. In a message broadcast to the entire Reich, he laid out von Treskow’s treachery in a booming voice. His plans to return the Reich to a monarchy, indeed to the same family that had once ruined it. He then invoked the logical next step, and declared himself the new Führer in opposition, in order to destroy this threat to the Thousand Year Reich. Even as he spoke, the military responded, with many troops from Eastern Germany, and Germania itself, declaring themselves loyal, and flooding into Germania for the inevitable standoff."

And of course, promised them all that no quarter would be given, in the battles or after. Any soldier that found themselves on the losing side would be executed for treason, they all knew. As such, they all entered the battle with the ferocity of men whose very lives were on the line. When the forces under Speidel began to push forward, to break the hastily constructed defenses of the city, Oberländer’s men did not break but became even yet more frenzied in their defense. They were dead men, either way, it was far better to die in glorious combat, than in front of a firing squad. Even their determined resistance would not stop the encroaching army forever, but they fought bitterly for every inch of ground, with direct tank and artillery fire into the city being necessary to finally end their rebellion. \n\nThe great city of Germania had been torn asunder in the fighting, with the Volkshalle in particular devastated by an aggressive exchange of artillery fire. Hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians had been massacred, with the projected death toll rising with each minute. The city was still a warzone, with small holdouts of Oberländer loyalists waiting for nearby troops to drop their awareness, before opening fire. As the day progressed, they were actively ambushing troops that attempted to aid civilians, causing an order to come through to cease aid to the civilians and focus only on their enemies. Thousands more would die of their injuries because of this decision. As the city still sat smoldering, the greatest project of Speer torn apart by the consequences of his death, none were certain as to what would happen next. The civilians, who had begun the day by hiding in their apartments, now seemed to grow angrier with each new report of the savagery that had been laid upon the city. And then the news broke that troops had been ordered to stop giving aid to them."

Some in the room, either despised him or had all hopes on him. Either way, the situation at hand was more terrifying than he could imagine, as his eyes went through the reports of traitors, mutinies, cities in the Rhine being basically under the control of the guerrilla, violent riots, and street battles in every part of the country that reminded him of the chaotic times of the Weimar Republic. Was the German nation doomed to follow the same path? Well, now was not the time to reminisce. As the Marshall began speaking, the whole room listened attentively. \n\n"The whole region of the Rhine has become a warzone, as the armies of Düsseldorf and Cologne were forced to retreat. Traitors amongst our ranks have led to the seizing of the port of Hamburg by the terrorists and recent reports from Vienna are indicating the same trend, although their uprising seems to be less bolshevik-aligned. We suspect that Himmler's Burgundy has also been supporting other kinds of terrorists, who claim to be loyal to the Reich but are as dangerous and destructive as the others." The words said by Von Tresckow led to diverse reactions by the officers, politicians, and bureaucrats in the room, as initially a civil discussion began, but descended into a fiery debate where the conservatives and reformists were almost ready to walk out, if not by Speidel's intervention. \n\n"Fighting this unconventional warfare with conventional means will lead to nothing but political suicide. Our goal is the survival of the German Reich, the stabilization of it, and the defeat of its enemies. Our foes, those who lie within or that watch from Washington and Tokyo, are counting on the possibility of further bloodshed and that we clash against each other again.

Even if it pained Henning Von Tresckow, the NSDAP was one of the main pillars of the Reich, and keeping it, at least for the time being, was a necessity. When the Marshall went to speak in the Reichstag, he had to keep his own opinions to himself and only focus on getting the point across. \n\n"Those here who stand to serve Germany, who have served it for ages, I am sure that many of you are as discontent and saddened by the situation that we find ourselves in. Once we were the undisputed masters of Europe, and now we sit here as our nation falls apart slowly due to our own choices. When Albert Speer rallied the German people to fight for their future, he promised change..but due to some circumstances, that change never arrived. For the future and stability of our fatherland, for our greatness to progress for a thousand years, we need to greatly transform Germany, through all means necessary. That is why the army has stepped in its salvation, for it to destroy not only the terrorists, that are the main enemy within, but for it to build a Germany that makes us proud again!" \n\nThe speech was met with applause from all of the room, with many shouting 'Sieg Heil!' towards the Old Prussian. Behind a seemingly proud smile, Von Tresckow only felt an aversion towards most of the party members, knowing very well of the atrocities they endorsed and some even personally carried out. But he had a mission, he could not let Germany fall again. He knew that the American and Japanese vultures circled it, just waiting for the body to fall for them to take a bite. That would not happen. Not on his watch, even if it meant having to ally with the party that led to all of this happening."

 tresckow.5.t: "A Task for Schmidt"
 tresckow.5.desc: "The reports from Austria were truly a nightmare. Around Vienna, red banners were everywhere, and terrorists lurked from every street, ready at a moment's notice to strike down German officers. Whilst many were just in the uprisings for 'democracy' or for 'worker's rights', some of the more radical so-called 'revolutionaries' were either bolsheviks or remnants of Austrians who opposed the long-lasting union with the rest of the Reich. Many traitors were involved in this state of affairs and it was certainly the main center of mayhem outside of the Rhine. Hans Speidel and Henning Von Tresckow had reached an agreement and decided that a new Reichsstatthalter had to be appointed. \n\nThe Prussian had just the man for the job, Helmut Schmidt, the former foreign minister and one of the main figures that called for greater reform. Although he was not born in Austria, he was still widely approved by a large chunk of the democratic movement, who had an enormous part in the coordination of the protests and resistance in the major cities of the region. Although protests from the more conservative wing of the party were sure to arrive, Von Tresckow knew this was the only way to calm the situation down. After a couple of calls, a meeting was set to happen in Hamburg, Schmidt's hometown, where he resided after the Death of Speer and the military intervention. \n\nInitially, Schmidt was very doubtful of this request, even slamming Tresckow for still cooperating with the likes of Theodor Oberländer, who he blamed for all the chaos that ruined their plans. Yet, his interest peaked when he heard of the plans and proposals for reform that some in the Junta wanted to implement. Carefully depositing his trust in the new government, Helmut took the job, arriving in a protected entourage in Vienna. After the Reichsstatthalter took some immediate action, the flames that engulfed the land that where the founder of the Third Reich came from, were slowly put out."

 tresckow.6.t: "Tensions in Germania"
 tresckow.6.desc: "The Volkshalle was filled with the highest-ranking members of the party, the most well-known generals and veteran admirals. Today was the day a historic compromise would be made, one that could save Germany from descending into a bloody conflict where brothers fought each other again. The lavish ceremony would begin, with the portrait of Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer behind Henning Von Tresckow and the window that would show the enormous city behind Theodor Oberländer, with the other members of the junta sitting at the table, such as Hermann Josef Abs, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Hans Speidel. \n\nAfter a toast to celebrate the survival and continuation of the German Reich and a long dinner, the plates were collected by the butlers and after everything was reorganized on the table, the time for discussion had begun. First, Kiesinger began to read the planned policies and proposals that Von Tresckow decided would be implemented for the political stabilization of the Reich, but as each line was read, it felt as if the tension was palpable, as Oberländer and his allies were visibly upset by what had been said. They were ready to walk out, but Henning stepped up once again after Kiesinger had read the list. \n\n''However, we understand some of these changes may not benefit the Reichstag, so as a sign of our recognition of the contribution of the National-Socialist Worker's Party and its leadership, we have also approved a raise in your salaries, the promotion of some associates and we are seeking to strengthen the cooperation between the party and the army to finally destroy the threat within.'' Those words were enough to calm most of the NSDAP's leadership present, as they quickly talked amongst themselves, before signing the paper that would be known as the 'Germania Compromise', approving the necessary actions that the Junta would take. To no one's surprise, Tresckow and Speidel planned far more. The two marshalls only wanted to keep this alliance and state of affairs temporarily, for they knew that the party would stand in the way of true change."

 tresckow.7.t: "Scapegoats To The Slaughter"
 tresckow.7.desc: "To even propose the liquidation of Speer's cabal of loyalists would have been considered an act of treason mere months ago, but now it only seems justified, with almost everyone in the Reich sharing an unspoken consensus on whatever basis, either ideological or personal importance. After all, it is the very least the Reich's greatest failure deserves, an architect of lies built on the bodies of dead idealists he and his loyalists stand on. Manipulating the German people with bread and circuses, he has thus managed to fail the German state, plunging it into a new dark age that eventually swallowed all, including him. \n\nPerhaps such sentiments have been infused with propaganda, spread quietly among media or loudly in rhetoric, but Tresckow himself couldn't deny that there certainly rests some truth in it. Signing the act into order, he eyes the relief and support from each man in the room, from Schmidt's moderate satisfaction to Abs' pride and Oberlander's hardly-contained glee, sighing. If only they'd be so supportive of his other policies, then perhaps Germany's fate will be truly saved. \n\nIt wouldn't take long for the result of such an order to take place. Members of the Wehrmacht had, in accordance with his orders, attempted to round up influential Speerites in the government. One of such is Hans Kehrl, a man driven by profit since the beginning: joining the NDSAP upon Hitler's rise to power in 1933, then proceeding to facilitate and run the Reich's bloody economy through his extensive network of state corporations, all the while benefiting from both the NDSAP and the SS. He aligned with Speer as his momentum grew, eventually playing a major role in the Reich's economic endeavors afterward. In his folly, however, he had entrenched his power in such depth that when Speer's house of cards fell, his fate was sealed. Notably rich, he had killed himself through cyanide in desperation when he got wind of the news, only to be discovered when Wehrmacht soldiers broke into his mansion and discovered his body, still warm. \n\nConcluding the report, Von Tresckow was satisfied and sighed, hiding a triumphant feeling. While it is certain that the others will not be so easy, such a successful start to his reforms is optimistic, to say the least."

 tresckow.8.t: "Trouble in Potsdam"
 tresckow.8.desc: "Theodor Oberländer crunched up an issue of the Volkischer Beobachter, throwing it into the trashbin at the corner of the hardliner's well-adorned office. His face was still acorn, still as unbelieving of Tresckow's words as he had first heard it when the man explained it all face-to-face, trying to justify the necessity of relaxing censorship and the very wall of protection the NSDAP has always vanguard against destructive yet infectious Judeo-Bolshevik thought, and even worse, releasing political prisoners–the very enemies of the Reich that called for its destruction–under pretenses to "maintain stability" and "stop political polarization". \n\nHe couldn't believe it: personally, he views those acts as weak, the same acts Weimar Judeo-Bolsheviks do when they decided to turn a blind eye against the rising NSDAP that would soon betray their institutions. Unlike then, however, such a fall is not directed on an enemy, nor is it beneficial. Instead, it would mean the fall of all of the work of millions of German volk, an utter regression of all the achievements of the master race since 1933 under the very enemies it has fought throughout its existence. For the President of the Reichstag, the amnesty law that had just been signed in Potsdam was one of the greatest heresies that a leader could commit. But, secretly, he understood that it would be necessary to have a wool glove containing their iron fist. \n\nOberländer sighed, cursing his mind's pace. Just as he had agreed with Hitler to censor decadence, and with Speer to capture these traitors to the Reich, he shall agree with Tresckow to undo both. Germany now lies in its most precarious state since the civil war–an utter mistake that must never be allowed to repeat, at all costs. He shall go along with proceedings, but also when Germany and National Socialism is benefited from such. When–well, if–von Tresckow has other goals in mind..."

 tresckow.9.t: "Beating Them Back"
 tresckow.9.desc: "Gerhard Baumann was one of the most peculiar revolutionaries, a veteran military musician of the Luftwaffe from Mecklenburg, his discontent with the government grew further as his life progressed, and when many members of the Wehrmacht's garrison in Hamburg defected after the internal conflict in the Kriegsmarine, he joined the band of antifascists in their seizing of the port city. He had been working with the commission that was set up, assisting the revolutionaries by boosting morale and composing music for them, always listening closely to the radio for inspiration. \n\nTo his surprise, one day, while listening to the news, he was caught off guard by a report. Günther Guillaume and various other captured agents were executed, the police had increased their counter-revolutionary persecutions and the army in the cities was once again reinforced. This must have been the work of the party, right? Well, Baumann was dumbfounded to know it was Tresckow that approved this measure. He did not believe a revolution would occur, but he thought the Marshall would meet the rebels at the negotiating table, well, he could not predict how wrong he was. \n\nLater, he was told to evacuate the city, as they were told that a large division of Wehrmacht tanks and Luftwaffe planes were coming their way, as Guillaume was tortured until he gave key positions to the rebel's locations in the city. In a matter of hours, with little to no resistance, the might of the army overwhelmed the city, capturing or killing the guerrillas that stayed, while the revolutionaries took an enormous step back, as this was an obvious sign of weakness. Luckily for him, Gerhard would be able to continue his musical endeavors for the Anti-Fascist Front and the Revolutionary Cells, as he was able to escape with a part of the leadership to one of the so-called 'Red Cities' within the Rhine."

 tresckow.10.desc: "His eyes could not believe it. The greatest army in the world, the one that swept through the lands of the French, that once reached Moscow and took over England, feared and respected by every foe it encountered, now defeated by backstabbers and terrorists, truly the worst kind of traitors to Germany. After the coup attempt, the divisions in the army only grew larger, as the forces loyal to the Wehrmacht fought each other, and the so-called 'revolutionaries' only expanded their ranks, integrating experienced officers that saw the reds as the winners. \n\nHonestly, Henning Von Tresckow could not blame them. What has Hitler's vision delivered in the last years if not mindless slaughter, economic instability, civil war, and political chaos? His attempts at bringing back the Kaiser's way, maybe becoming a second Otto Von Bismarck of sorts could prevent this collapse, but due to the National-Socialist Worker's Party and Oberländer's army of conservatives foolishly striking against him, the dream was shattered into pieces. \n\nThe unification of the revolutionary groups into one 'Volksarmee' that quickly began to expel any government forces from the Burgundian border, was met with resistance in Dortmund, but that resistance from the Heer was crushed, marking the biggest communist victory yet in their uprising. Whatever forces didn't surrender or defect to the reds, fled to Frankfurt and Münster, where they were not able to regroup and organize due to immediate attacks from local guerrillas. In the Rhine, a new black, red, and gold flag with a compass was planted in the temporary capital of the revolution. \n\nAlthough Tresckow did not want to admit it yet, this was the beginning of the end. Not only was the population turned against the government, but every political institution was also either shut down or deeply divided. The armed forces were at each other's throats, with traitors and defectors being the norm. A single tear descended from his eyes, as his saddened face whispered some words as he read the last reports."

 tresckow.11.t: "A Marshall's Demise"
 tresckow.11.desc: "Millions across the planet watched as Henning Von Tresckow, the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht and the de facto leader of Germany appeared in front of a crowd of thousands in Germania for a speech to address the entire nation and the developing situation in regards to the communist uprising. The expectations were high, as many thought, he was going to call upon the forces that once assisted the Reichskomissariats, special divisions spread across the world such as in Africa or in the rest of Europe, to fight for the Reich's survival, for a last fight against the wretched red threat. \n\nInstead, the Marshall made a shocking revelation to the entire world. He used his time in the spotlight to reveal and openly discuss at least some of the crimes carried out by Adolf Hitler and other political rivals of the Gang of Four, also openly condemning the Schutzstaffel and the Burgundian state, denouncing all of these groups and their actions as the ones who truly corrupted and sent the people of Germany into a dark era of deception and bloodshed. \n\nIn the rest of his speech, he called for mercy, piety, and unity between the German peoples, talking about how families were being torn apart, brothers were fighting brothers once again and that cruelty was an affront in the face of God. The Old Prussian also noted that there was also nothing he could do for the nation anymore, as he had done all within his power to stabilize it and diminish the casualties from what he called a 'Red Terror' across all metropolitan lands of Germany. \n\nAs the Volksarmee began their moves to encircle Germania and face off against Tresckow's army, they quickly learned that they were not going to face the same enemy, as Henning openly announced his resignation as the commander-in-chief, leaving a confused and desperate Hans Speidel in charge of the rump state. The former marshall left for his hometown in Magdeburg with his wife, Erika von Falkenhayn, knowing that his last decisions at least would spare a couple of lives, including theirs."

This scenario that could only be in the worst nightmares of the highest-ranking generals and politicians of the Reich years ago was now a reality, but unlike most of them predicted, those were not Asian or Russian 'Hordes', nor 'Degenerate' Americans, they were mostly Germans just like them. The Thälmann Brigade, as it called itself, was made of the most experienced revolutionaries, forged by years of battles, survival, and with blood in their eyes to destroy what their saw as the greatest evil of humanity. \n\nFor the first time, a new figure appeared from the shadows, to raise morale within the troops, that were weary to face the legendary Hans Speidel and the remaining Wehrmacht in the capital of the collapsing Third Reich. A man who shouted that it was the time, for the proletarians all across Germany, to land their final strike, that had been leading this army from the depths of secretive bases that were used to organize the party and army of the communists. \n\nThis man was called Markus Wolf, and truly, like one of these canine beings, he had a ruthless pack of sharp-teeth revolutionaries ready to rip apart their prey. As he gave the order, the troops marched into battle, facing off the last remnants of the once glorious Heer and Luftwaffe in battle. The skies roared, with dogfighting ensuing, while divisions from both sides met in the ruined outskirts of the city, as hundreds of thousands of civilians evacuated, fearing a massacre like Oberländer's was incoming. \n\nWhen the dust settled once again in Germania, the victorious army was the revolutionary army, a narrow victory, as most of their invading forces were wiped out in battle. Hundreds of tanks and planes were spread across the city, in pieces, while thousands of men lay dead, buried under the rubble of battle. Climbing the Volkshalle, two soldiers carried the DVR flag, removing the eagle and planting the flag of the new, Red Germany. Or as they called it..."

In the days since Tresckow had arrested him and his subordinates, Oberländer had been detained in a basement of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The horrible rankness and dankness of the room had been terrible on his health and Oberländer had been suffering through this cough for days now. \n\nThe cellar door opened just as stronger coughing fit racked Oberländer, doubling him over. Over the sound of him hacking up his lungs, he could hear harsh commands and the soles of boots scraping the floor.  From his hunched over position, Oberländer could only see the shoes of the man in front of him. They were an ugly pair of boots, a size too small, scuffed and covered in mud. Oberländer straightened his back and raised his head, to look the owner of those boots in the eyes. He wanted to see what kind of man would leave his boots in those conditions, what kind of man that Tresckow was entrusting the serve the Reich now. But as he made his eyes level with the man in front of him, Oberländer didn’t notice him at all. The only thing he could focus on was the barrel of the rifle pointed at his face. \n\nA voice gave a command."

He did not believe he would need to talk and negotiate with terrorists, the same red devils that wanted to destroy the nation from within after the stab in the back in 1918.  It was genuinely confusing for him how the situation got so dire, yet, he could not help but attempt his best to reduce the damage. He waited a couple of seconds, even doubting that the number that he was given was in fact valid. He could only hope that he was not being made a fool of. \n\nSuddenly, a voice came from the other side. Was this an illusion? Has he finally gone mad? This voice was certainly not normal, it was deeper, and the sounds were crackling, as the supposed negotiator spoke. Nonetheless, Tresckow replied, thinking about the situation. The old man could not hope to comprehend the obvious voice modification occurring, believing it to be an error in the telephone. For the leaders before him, this was madness, but Von Tresckow knew what needed to be done. \n\nThe discussion was surprisingly positive, as the communists and the government agreed on humanitarian lines and to avoid atrocities on the civilians who had nothing to do with the power struggle. Even though it was clear that the government of the commander-in-chief was on the back foot and faced imminent collapse, the Reds found the terms acceptable as it improved not only their image but indirectly caused their takeover to occur more smoothly and appear more professional. On the other side of Germany, Markus Wolf was listening in with his associates, specifying every word that should be said on his typewriter, that a trusted comrade of him read as he replied to Von Tresckow's proposals. After more minutes of negotiations, the last troops in Bremen loyal to the government not only surrendered but signed an under-the-table document that would protect and save the lives of hundreds of Germans on both sides. As the last question, Henning asked who he was speaking to."

 tresckow.15.desc: "It was a dark night on the German coast. Tresckow silently stared at the papers, barely knowing who he had to meet. One man, he knew, George C. McGhee, the American ambassador, and two other CIA agents that he did not even know existed. Along with the commander-in-chief, stood a group of soldiers, armed to the teeth, accompanied by none other than Ludwig Erhard and Helmut Schmidt. The two figures anxiously awaited the arrival of what could be their salvation from certain execution at the hands of the Reds. \n\nTheir hopes were elevated when a black car arrived in the distance, with the two front lights on and carrying the flag of the ambassador. Taking a step outside the car, the ambassador and his agents approached the most powerful men in the Reich. For McGhee, this was quite the surprise, he would never expect to meet the leader of Germany in this situation, especially asking for help. Coincidentally, both of them were not fond of the communists, and in this regard, they could work together. \n\n"I must inform you that our bosses at Washington are not cheering for your victory, commander. The fact that this deal is even possible happened due to a stroke of luck, so you might as well play your cards right, or else we will walk away from the table.'' Announced the proud ambassador. The soldiers were shocked at the level of disrespect, but Tresckow only cared about the negotiations. "We can assure you we have a lot of resources, financial or not, that can fully cover the costs of this operation and more.'' The marshall replied, while Erhard was crunching the numbers. The agents approached Ludwig Erhard and after some discussions, the ambassador came to a conclusion. ''What you can provide is beneficial enough to covertly engage in the rescue and transfer of your associates and various other refugees to America. It surprises me you will stay here. I assume you'll resist to the bitter end?" McGhee questioned Tresckow."

Every member of the NSDAP that was still deeply involved in the politics of the crumbling party that had its Reichtag suspended since the Oberländer coup attempt returned to Germania for a meeting, As Tresckow watched anxiously, secretly knowing that this meeting would be the last one of the party so rotten that he had blamed it for all the atrocities and the ruin of the German nation. The remaining Wehrmacht guarded the place, knowing that backlash was to come as they were warned of what the Marshall planned. \n\nHans Speidel stood shoulders to shoulders with Henning Von Tresckow, as the commander-in-chief and his right-hand man stared down those who were once the most powerful men in the most powerful party in the globe. Their faces and eyes expressed different feelings, some of disgust and hatred, some of hope and loyalty. Many of those men wanted a Führer, one that could destroy the Judeo-Bolshevik threat and save Germany from it once again. Albert Speer failed, Oberländer failed, could Tresckow succeed? \n\nTheir expectations were soon crushed by the deafening truth that the Reich would continue to live on without a Führer. Tresckow did not want to lead the party, he did not want to follow in the same footsteps of Albert Speer and Adolf Hitler. Instead, the reasoning for which he called this meeting was, in his own words, ''to do what should have been done 40 years ago.'' Hans Speidel announced, with armed men surrounding him, the dissolution of the National-Socialist Worker's Party of Germany. The reasoning for the dissolution was not only the massacre that occurred in Germania, but their treason against the salvation junta and many acts that the military-aligned reformists pointed out as ''unspeakable'' and ''incompetent''. In reality, Tresckow knew that doing this would not make the revolutionaries stop their advance, but with all this power in his hands, he had to lay one final blow."

Something that they all knew all but one man. "Shut up!" yells Schörner inside the command bunker of the Heer, the man in charge of the defense a mission in which, he has failed.  "We have the order of defending the city! I don't care about anything else." On his side, the second in command Otto Remer, watches his direct superior having a mental breakdown, in silence, letting the rest speak. \n\n"Sir, there is no way we can hold, the city supply lines are being destroyed and the enemy has already captured all key points." Explains a junior officer before being stopped by a punch on the table and more yelling. "I don't care if you are incompetent, we have orders to stop the communist advance, and if I hear another one of you crying." The gunshot was heard in the bunker, and before the blood hit the uniform of any officer, Remer had already pushed the dead body of the Field Marshall to the ground cleaning the bits of teeth bone, and blood from the table map. \n\n"Order all units to retreat. We are taking a defensive position around Germania and the remaining ports that we still hold, these orders are to be executed immediately, anything we can not evacuate needs to need to be destroyed, this includes slaves." Said the new commander, not being willing to give any more recruits to those damn reds and then staring at the terrified officers, who followed suit, trying their best to get everything done in time for their march Northeast. \n\nAlong the march, words of Ernst Remer's actions were heard. This not only disrupted the march, as troops loyal to Tresckow went to investigate, thinking maybe they were traitors but caused Remer, in an attempt to save his own skin, to abandon his soldiers, vanishing out of sight and not being found by the Reds nor the Wehrmacht. As the army had to deal with the invading Volksarmee, the search for the general was called off."

When Karl Marx elaborated on this, he was pointing out the 'tragedy and farce' in the two coups by Napoleon and his nephew. It seems that in this case, Marxism itself made history repeat itself. Once again, Bavaria was red. To the cheer of many and to the dismay of others, this explosive return of a socialist government in Bavaria came about after the Münich and Nuremberg divisions finally surrendered. \n\nLike in Austria, Bavarian revolutionaries were participating in a broad front, being part of the Antifascist Front of the Volksarmee and many of them were not directly under Max Reimann's political directories. As the red flag was once again planted in Münich, to the sound of cheers and marches from those who claimed to be the successors of Eugen Leviné's movement, speeches were held saying that this time, the 'white guard of capitalism' had been defeated. Truly, the Volksarmee had triumphed in the south of the Reich. \n\nOne man, much unlike the revolutionaries, was desperate. Kiesinger had been living in exile and moving between the cities of the Reich ever since the coup attempt failed. He was waiting for the Wehrmacht to come and restore order, but they never came. The hours passed by, as he stared out of his window in complete fear. Due to the current events, he was not known as a lawyer, not as Speer's second in command, but as Oberländer's supporter. Sweat dripped on his face, as he prayed to God that no one would find him. \n\nAs he heard two knocks on his door, he almost had a heart attack. He opened the door, almost ready to die, but as he adjusted his glasses, he found out it was his wife, Marie-Louise. For some reason, she didn't even reply to him. She just grabbed a handful of her things, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and left. Kiesinger could not even ponder what happened, as when she left, agents entered his house. "Kurt Georg Kiesinger. You have been accused of collaborating with Hitlerite, Speerite, and Oberländerite atrocities. The Volksarmee finds you guilty and your sentence is to be shot.''

The arrival of American ships on the German coast is something that only appeared in propaganda to portray the brave Germans resisting the threat of foreign invaders. Ironically, they were now, instead, running into the arms of the United States for salvation. \n\nTo many hardliners, this was shameful, instead of raising an army out of the proud people of Germany to resist in a final fight against the Judeo-Bolshevik threat of the Volksarmee, Henning von Tresckow was letting these cowards flee to the enemy's side! For all they knew, it was America that caused this in the first place. To the revolutionaries, this was to be expected, as once again, the reactionaries are shown to be mere 'paper tigers', tucking their tails between their legs and running away. \n\nWhat was unknown to the public, however, was that this evacuation was a deal between the three parties involved - the U.S, the SED, and the Salvation Junta. They all knew of what would happen and why it would happen, however, things did not go as smoothly as planned. When word of mouth spread about the emigration, many rushed to Rostock for their chance to move to the land of the free. Others, like Hermann Josef Abs, felt betrayed. \n\nAs the evacuation of Rostock was carried out in a chaotic manner, with many ships being overstocked and overcrowded, a scene similar to the Portuguese nobility's escape in 1808 occurred, with German and American ships, along with some planes starting their journey to New York, Washington, and Boston. After the majority of the 'authorized' ships left, the truce was over and the Volksarmee and Volksmarine captured the entire city. \n\nOn a business ship sailing through the Baltic Sea, Abs thought to himself. Where did he go wrong? He was sure that Henning could restore stability and would never put him aside. Well, none of it would matter when he assumed his new identity in America. Or so he would have if one of the men in his ship was not one of the SZ's many spies, who suspiciously left the cruiser in his own boat minutes before a Volksmarine destroyer appeared."
