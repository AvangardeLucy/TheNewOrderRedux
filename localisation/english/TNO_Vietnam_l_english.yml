 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_BAO_DAI_DESC:0 "Bào Dai is a man haunted by could-have-beens; as a child, he was raised to the throne more or less by decree in the wake of his father's death, and his moves have been carefully planned by others for most of his life since then. Not much has improved significantly since the days of his youth; the puppet masters now speak Japanese rather than French, and the grain convoys go to Osaka and Nagoya rather than to Paris, but Vietnam still chafes under a foreign boot, and he with it. And he is powerless to stop it.\n\nAs emperor, Bảo Dại has grown increasingly autocratic in his rule, preferring to rule without the help of his council. Which is ironic, considering those he relies upon to do his bidding are themselves loyal more to their paymasters in Tokyo than to the Emperor. Most of the rest of the country is indifferent to his decrees in any case, as Vietnam churns with rebellious sentiment and insurgents, just as it did in the last days of French rule. Ho Chi Minh lurks in the shadows, ready to pounce, and the overlords wait for a misstep to justify further intrusion.\n\nBào Dai sees his present and yearns for lost futures, for the dream of an independent and strong Empire that died when the Japanese marched in. His regrets are Vietnam's own; but unlike him, Vietnam has a chance of forging its own path and making it out alive. Bào Dai knows that when the future comes for him, he will be swept away, just another cobweb in the dusty hall. It's not like he has a choice in the matter."

 VIN_idea_viet_minh:0 "League for the Independence of Vietnam"
 VIN_idea_viet_minh_desc:0 "On every map of the world, the territory under the Empire of Vietnam is represented as united under the government in Hue. However, if one were to step foot into the countryside, they would not find our police forces nor the Imperial Japanese Army patrolling the villages, but the communist League for the Independence of Vietnam, or Viet Minh in short. They began their fight for Vietnam's independence against the French in 1941, but now they changed their target to the Vietnamese government and Japanese forces in the country. Under the charismatic leadership of Ho Chi Minh and Truong Chinh, the Viet Minh have gathered support from all over the country and even beyond, including elements from the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. Although activities have been decreasing since the 1950s, they are waiting for a single moment of weakness to strike the country and bring about their §R"Revolution"§!..."

But in reality, Vietnam has merely changed its master from an European to an Asian one. We have no control over our economy, nor our military matters, even our internal politics are manipulated by Japan. Japanese cultural influence only increases day by day, eclipsing even the French. The Japanese have merely taken the place of the French, in more ways than one. And some legal scholars who have done much digging have found that the Indochinese Federation under France has never technically been dissolved..."

 VIN_idea_the_faltering_establishment_desc:0 "When Tokyo appointed the technocrats from the National Front of Vietnam to lead the country after the Greater East Asia War, they believed they would do their job properly. However, the failure of Operation Yon-Go in 1961, and the subsequent finger-pointing between the 38th Army and the Tran Van Chuong government, revealed the instability inherent in the political establishment of the country. With the resignation of former Prime Minister Tran Van Chuong, former healthcare minister Vu Ngoc Anh was appointed as a caretaker Prime Minister, but his government is missing vital support from the National Front of Vietnam. As the factions in the Vietnamese government fight amongst themselves to see who will replace him, the Viet Minh prepare their next moves..."

 VIN_idea_a_new_phase_desc:0 "Ever since Meigo Sakusen overthrew the French colonialists in 1947, the reconstitution of Vietnamese defense forces has been the main political priority for all Vietnamese governments. With the Viet Minh threat receding in the 1950s, Japan began to block such actions. However, with the failure of Operation Yon-Go in 1960, Governor-General Tsuchihashi Yuitsu has finally allowed us to proceed with a tentative expansion of Vietnam armed forces. However, the government must be careful to both wean themselves from Japan while also maintaining their generous assistance."

Already, widespread protests have taken place against the coup, with mass defections to the Viet Minh. Moreover, the Japanese legations seem to be skeptical, at the very least, about the coup. The Prince must take swift action to ensure Japanese support and calm the population."

Taking inspiration from movements in Thailand and Japan, the government is embarking on a radical social reorganization. The existing scouting movements have been reorganized into the Revolutionary Youth, women are being organized, and more. There are, however, worrying reports of intimidation, violence, and a campaign in the north involving mass executions and abuse, targeted at suspected Viet Minh..."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_HO_CHI_MINH_DESC:0 "The man called Ho Chí Minh by the world has been known as Nguyen Sinh Cung and Bác Ho - "Uncle Ho" - in addition to something between fifty and two-hundred other pseudonyms. Virtually nothing is known about his life other than that he was born in Central Vietnam in 1890, and that he was trained in Marxist politics in France and Russia. He is, however, known and grudgingly respected by all Vietnamese - even his enemies - as a polyglot and a competent poet, whose poems in the Chu Hán and Chu Quoc Ngu scripts make for easy reading and listening for nearly the whole realm.\n\nNow, on the other hand, they know something more about him than before. After more than two decades of struggle, first against the French, then against the Vichy French, and at last against the Japanese - all the same breed of imperialists, Ho knew quite well - Ho will not go quietly, if at all. Having carved out a free zone in Northern Vietnam, and with agents seemingly seeded throughout the country, Ho has become more than just a leader - he is a enigma and a bogeyman to the Japanese and the Vietnamese government, and a nearly mythical hero to anyone who stands against them. \n\nBut Ho Chi Minh grows old, and even as Japan's grip on Asia weakens, Ho senses he may not live long enough to see Vietnam stand proudly as an independent nation. The Vietnamese people know and rally to Uncle Ho - but who will they follow after he is gone?"
 POLITICS_TRUONG_CHINH_DESC:0 "The man who now calls himself Truong Chinh was born as Dang Xuân Khu in the Red River Delta not far from Hà Noi in 1907. After twenty-nine years spent on a life journey that led him first towards socialism and later towards the communism of Ho Chí Minh, he took his current name - "Long March" in Vietnamese - to honor the Long March undertaken by Mao Zedong, who was later to be martyred fighting the Japanese imperialists.\n\nNow Ho Chí Minh is dead, and an at least temporary victory against the Japanese has been assured. His successor is the man who the Vietnamese communists were proud to refer to as the 'excellent student of Bác (Uncle) Ho' - Truong Chinh. His revolutionary credentials are impeccable, and his loyalty to Vietnam and the Communist Party never in doubt: he took pride in his devotion to Ho's ideals even though he did not always agree with them.\n\nWith control now fully in Truong's hands, and the loyalty of his party and nation more or less assured, Truong is freed to move forward with a somewhat changed ideological program: the main plans will be predicated upon a land reform inspired by Mao Zedong's writings combined with a Bolshevist interpretation of the anti-colonial movement.\n\nRegardless of his plans, Truong will give his predecessor every reason to be proud of him. This he swears on his honor and loyalty to the Revolution and to Vietnam."
 ### Ideas ###
 VIC_20_years_of_resistance:0 "20 Years of Resistance"
 VIC_20_years_of_resistance_desc:0 "The Viet Minh have been around for nearly twenty years at this point, and in that time it has cemented itself as the premier anti-Japanese resistance organization in Vietnam. It has outlasted its Chinese comrades, having endured the worst of the Japanese where they unfortunately scattered. The Viet Minh has repulsed successive Japanese attacks, endured through Thai savagery, and still remains a force to be reckoned with within Indochina. So long as imperialism and reaction remain on the Indochinese Peninsula, the Viet Minh shall last for another twenty years."

Remnants of the National Revolutionary Army, particularly the Communist-led New Fourth and Eighth Route Armies have made their way south to Yunnan and Guangxi, where they have since made contact with the Viet Minh. For their part, the Viet Minh have welcomed these exiles with open arms, bringing greatly-needed expertise and soldiers to the struggle. However, everyone knows that their cooperation, while incredibly fruitful, will soon diminish as the exiles plot their comeback…"

 VIC_victory_in_lang_son_desc:0 "The Viet Minh dealt its first offensive victory against the Japanese with the Summer-Autumn Border Campaign, devised by Vo Nguyen Giap with the assistance of Ye Jianying. In a matter of weeks, VM forces defeated the Fifth Division of the 38th Army, taking the city of Lang Son and forcing a retreat to Hon Gai. This stunning victory has shocked both the Japanese and the Vietnamese public, who now have turned against the imperial government for their handling of the crisis. And while the government falls apart, the Viet Minh have already begun moving to expand and further undermine both Empires of Japan and Vietnam."
